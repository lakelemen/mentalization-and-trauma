This study examined the validity of the Child Reﬂective Functioning Scale (CRFS: Ensink,
Target, & Oandason, 2013, Child reﬂective functioning scale scoring manual: for application to
the Child Attachment Interview. London, UK: Anna Freud Centre –University College
London), a measure designed to assess reﬂective functioning (RF) or mentalization during
middle childhood. Participants were 94 mother –child dyads divided into two subgroups;
46 dyads where children had histories of intrafamilial ( n=22 dyads) or extrafamilial
(n=24 dyads) sexual abuse, and a community control group composed of 48 mother –
child dyads. RF of children and their mothers was assessed using videotaped and
transcribed data gathered using the Child Attachment Interview and the Parent
Development Interview (PDI: Slade, Aber, Bresi, Berger, & Kaplan, 2004, The parent
development interview-Revised . New York, NY: The City University of New York). The
ﬁndings indicate that the CRFS proved reliable, with excellent intraclass correlation
coefﬁcients for general RF, as well as RF regarding self and others. Signiﬁcant differences inRF were found between sexually abused children and the control group, and also between
children who had experienced intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse. This provides
support for the discriminant validity of the CRFS. Furthermore, maternal RF wasassociated with child RF. Both abuse and maternal RF made signiﬁcant contributions to
predicting children’s RF regarding themselves, but child sexual abuse was the only variable
that made a signiﬁcant contribution to explaining variance in children’s RF regardingothers.
How do children understand their relationships with their attachment ﬁgures and how do
they think about themselves? Despite a burgeoning body of research on the developmentof children’s social cognition and understanding of feelings and reactions of others, weknow surprisingly little about the development of children’s capacities to consider theirclose relationships and themselves in mental state terms. The reﬂective functioning (RF)
paradigm developed by Fonagy, Steele, Moran, Steele, and Higgitt (1991) provides a
methodology for assessing, in adults, this particular dimension of social cognition or

mentalization, involving the capacity to consider close relationships and the self in terms
of mental states and see the behaviours of signiﬁcant others in terms of underlyingpsychological motivations, thought, feelings, intentions, and desires (Fonagy, Gergely,Jurist, & Target, 2002). There is evidence suggesting that RF is particularly important in
the context of trauma and adversity, with high RF associated with resilience (Berthelot
et al. , 2014; Ensink et al. , 2014; Fonagy, Steele, Steele, Higgitt, & Target, 1994), but at this
stage, research on child RF in general and in the context of trauma in particular ishampered by the lack of a reliable and validated measure of child RF. The aim of this studywas to provide evidence of the reliability and validity of the Child Reﬂective FunctioningScale (CRFS) by examining whether the CRFS could be used to detect differences in RFassociated with exposure to trauma (sexual abuse), as well as the context of trauma (intra-versus extrafamilial).
Development of mentalization and socio-cognitive capacities in children
Fonagy and Target (1996) have elaborated a developmental model of mentalization andRF based on an integration of ﬁndings from research on attachment, Theory of Mind(ToM), social cognition, and emotional understanding. In this model, the early sense ofself crystalizes around the experience of being treated by a caregiver as a psychologicalbeing with a mind, with the child developing a coherent sense of self and identity through
interactions with a caregiver that reﬂects on his mind (Fonagy, Gergely, & Target, 2007;
Fonagy & Target, 2006). As Fonagy and Target (2006) observed, it is also difﬁcult todevelop the capacity to imagine the minds of others and to mentalize in relation to otherswithout the experience of having been treated as someone with a mind.
From this perspective, parental RF is considered to be central to the processes
through which children develop their mentalization capacities (Slade, 2005) and thereis growing direct and indirect evidence in support of this proposition. For example,mothers with higher RF have been shown to use more mind-minded comments that
refer to the child’s state of mind when interacting with their infants and young
children (Rosenblum, McDonough, Sameroff, & Muzik, 2008). In turn, mental statetalk across diverse situations ranging from picture-book reading to dinner-time familydiscussions has consistently been found to be pivotal for the development ofchildren’s emotional understanding and ToM (de Rosnay, Harris, & Pons, 2008; Doan& Wang, 2010; Dunn, Brown, & Beardsall, 1991; Ereky-Stevens, 2008; Ruffman, Slade,& Crowe, 2002; Symons, Fossum, & Collins, 2006; Taumoepeau & Ruffman, 2008).Furthermore, there is research evidence that parent –child dyadic co-construction of
narratives about emotionally signiﬁcant events (Bettens, Favez, & Stern, 2003; Laible,
Murphy, & Augustine, 2013) facilitates the development of event- and autobiograph-ical memory (Prebble, Addis, & Tippett, 2013), considered central to the develop-ment of the self. This research evidence and the developmental model developed byFonagy and Target (2006) is consistent with the earlier proposition by Vygotsky’s(1978) that children learn complex competencies in the context of interpersonalrelationships in which they are scaffolded and practiced before they become,through a process of internalization and representation, part of the intrapersonal
repertoire.
There is evidence that parental RF predicts the development of emotional
understanding of children (Steele, Steele, Croft, & Fonagy, 1999), as well as RF in
adolescence (Benbassat & Priel, 2012). However, data on the relationship betweenparental RF and that of children are still lacking.204 Karin Ensink et al.

Mentalization in the context of trauma
Considering the importance of the parent’s reﬂective stance for all the parent –child
interactions through which children learn about themselves and others and develop theirmentalization capacities, it is not surprising that deﬁcits across a range of mentalization
capacities have been identiﬁed in maltreated children. Abuse and neglect have
been shown to be associated with poor discrimination of all emotions (Edwards,Shipman, & Brown, 2005; Pollak, Cicchetti, Hornung, & Reed, 2000) as well as delays inself-recognition in the mirror between 18 and 30 months (Schneider-Rosen & Cicchetti,1991), ToM (Cicchetti, Rogosch, Maughan, Toth, & Bruce, 2003; Pears & Fisher, 2005),and emotional understanding (Camras, Sachs-Alter, & Ribordy, 1996; Rogosch, Cicchetti,& Aber, 1995; Shipman & Zeman, 1999). Less is known regarding mentalization inchildren who have experienced sexual abuse. Sexually abused girls have been found to
have lower emotional understanding compared to non-maltreated peers in one study
(Shipman, Zeman, Penza, & Champion, 2000) and this requires further replications. Fewstudies on child maltreatment have speciﬁcally addressed the relationship between familyprocesses and children’s emotional understanding, but there is some evidence thatmaltreating parents engage their children less often in emotional discussions (Edwardset al. , 2005) and that they manifest impairments in their capacity to understand their
children’s expression of affect (Shipman & Zeman, 2001). Intrafamilial sexual abuse canbe expected to undermine the development of mentalization at multiple levels. The act of
abuse can be argued to be incompatible with mentalizing the child’s experience (Allen,
2013). Parents who abuse may be unable or unwilling to imagine the child’s internalexperience, may discourage coherent discourse about mental states, and undermine thedevelopment of mentalization in children to avoid engaging with the psychologicalimpact and suffering they inﬂict (Allen, Fonagy, & Bateman, 2008; Fonagy & Luyten,2009). Children may be terriﬁed to think of the minds of caregivers who sometimesharbour malevolent intentions or have distorted representations of them and may avoidthinking of this in order to preserve their attachment relationships (Allen, 2013; Fonagy
et al. , 2002). By comparison, children who experienced extrafamilial sexual abuse are
more likely to have access to relationships with parents that have fostered mentalizationregarding self and others and will help the child to mentalize the traumatic experience.
Developing a reliable measure for assessing mentalization in children
Whereas the theoretical literature on mentalization in middle childhood is burgeoning,empirical efforts to develop psychometrically sound and age appropriate measure of RF in
this subpopulation are lagging behind (Humfress, O’Connor, Slaughter, Target, & Fonagy,
2002; Shmueli-Goetz, Target, Fonagy, & Datta, 2008). The challenge is to develop anassessment procedure that takes advantage of the increasing language capacities ofchildren of this age group, but is able to distinguish between developmentally determinedlimitations in narrative abilities (Shmueli-Goetz et al. , 2008) and mentalization difﬁculties.
The assessment of mentalization in attachment contexts is arguably the best indicator
of an individual’s mentalization capacities, and for this reason, it is traditionally codedfrom the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996) using the Adult
Reﬂective Functioning Scale (ARFS; Fonagy, Target, Steele, & Steele, 1998). Following the
practice of rating adult RF from AAIs, the Child Attachment Interview (CAI; Shmueli-Goetzet al. , 2008) also makes it possible to assess RF in children. To pursue this objective,
Ensink, Target, and Oandasan (2013) developed the CRFS. The CRFS is applied to thevideotaped and transcribed narratives children produce in response to the CAI.Mentalization in middle childhood and trauma 205

Descriptions of themselves and their attachment relationships are rated to obtain
indicators of mentalization regarding self as well as attachment ﬁgures. Compared to otherunderstanding, self-understanding has been argued to be a more complex developmentalachievement (Bodgan, 2003), involving slightly different, although proximal, neural
networks (Lieberman, 2007) and possibly associated with different forms of interpersonal
difﬁculties and psychosocial disturbances (Luyten & Fonagy, 2012).
The main purpose of this study was to examine the reliability and preliminary validity
of the CRFS, a measure speciﬁcally designed to assess RF or mentalization activated in anattachment context during middle childhood. To do this, we examined whether the CRFS(Ensink et al. , 2013) could be used to reliably rate children’s RF elicited in response to the
CAI questions. The validity of two speciﬁc predictions was examined. First, it is generallyassumed that abuse and trauma during childhood is associated with negative impacts in a
number of domains including self-understanding, social cognition, and emotional
understanding (Cicchetti & Toth, 1995). Empirical literature on the impact of childsexual abuse on mentalization is practically non-existent, but based on previous ﬁndingswith children exposed to physical abuse, we will test the hypothesis that, as compared tomatched controls, sexually abused children will have poorer RF. Second, there is a largernumber of empirical studies showing that parental mentalization –maternal causal mental
state talk, stimulation of perspective taking, family discussion of emotions, etc. –facilitates
young children’s early self-understanding and other understanding (Sharp & Fonagy,
2008a). There are no comparable studies for middle childhood, but based on ﬁndings with
younger children as well as adolescents, we predicted that parent mentalization and childmentalization, measured as RF in adult and child interviews, respectively, would besigniﬁcantly associated.
Method
Participants and procedureParticipants were 94 mother –child dyads divided into two subgroups. The clinical group
consisted of 46 dyads where the children had histories of intrafamilial ( n=22 dyads, 15
girls, 7 boys, Mage=111 months, SD=17.1) or extrafamilial ( n=24 dyads, 19 girls, 5
boys, Mage=120 months, SD=18.1) sexual abuse. Intrafamilial abuse was perpetrated
either by fathers ( n=11), stepfathers ( n=3), siblings ( n=6), or grandfathers ( n=2).
Extrafamilial abuse was perpetrated by acquaintances ( n=14), members of the
extended, but not immediate, family ( n=9), or strangers ( n=1). Mothers of sexually
abused children were single ( n=18), separated or divorced ( n=13), married ( n=9), or
cohabiting ( n=6). These dyads were referred by Youth Protection Services. In terms of
the type and severity of the abuse, 45 (98%) of 46 cases involved genital contact, with 19(42%) involving penetration.
The community control group was composed of 48 mother –child dyads, selected to
broadly match the socio-demographic, age, and gender characteristics of the abusedgroup. Mean age for the 29 girls and 19 boys in this group was 119 months ( SD=16).
Mothers were cohabiting ( n=21), married ( n=15), separated or divorced ( n=6), or
single ( n=6). This group was recruited through advertisements at Community Health
Services and Day Care centres. To identify and exclude children in the control group withpossible histories of sexual abuse and other traumatic life events, parents of control groupchildren were interviewed about the child’s developmental history and traumatic lifeevents.206 Karin Ensink et al.

Control group families were matched with families from the clinical group on maternal
education and child age (within 6 months). This procedure proved effective, and therewere no signiﬁcant between-group differences with regard to maternal education(M=13.7 years, SD=2.8, for the intrafamilial abuse group; M=13.8 years, SD=2.3,
for the extrafamilial group; and M=14.9 years, SD=3.3 for the comparison group), F(2,
91)=2.38, p>.05, child age ( M=111 months, SD=17, for the intrafamilial abuse
group; M=120 months, SD=18, for the extrafamilial group; and M=119 months,
SD=16, for the comparison group), F(2, 91) =2.20, p>.05, or number of siblings
(M=2.38, SD=0.92, for the intrafamilial abuse group; M=3.09, SD=2.7, for the
extrafamilial group; and M=2.15, SD=0.99, for the comparison group), F(2,
91)=2.06, p>.05. The majority of the participants were Caucasians. A signed consent
was obtained from all subjects and their parents, and the research was approved by our
University Ethics Committee. Parents received a modest stipend to cover transport costs,
and children were invited to choose a toy or small gift.
Measures
Child Reﬂective Functioning Scale
The CRFS (Ensink et al. , 2013) was adapted from the ARFS (Fonagy et al. , 1998) and was
used to rate videotaped and transcribed data gathered using the CAI (Shmueli-Goetz et al. ,
2008; Target, Fonagy, Shmueli-Goetz, Datta, & Schneider, 1998). The CAI is a 15-questionassessment protocol developed to activate the attachment system and to elicit narrativesabout the self and relationships with attachment ﬁgures. For the purpose of the present
study, the CAI was translated into French and then back-translated to assure equivalence
with the original English version. Four female doctoral psychology students conductedthe interviews.
The CRFS manual enables trained raters to make an objective assessment of children’s
ability to provide mentalizing accounts of themselves and their key attachment
relationships in response to the CAI questions. The manual contains descriptions andexamples of different levels and types of CRF. Children’s narratives are coded on an 11-point scale ( /C01 to 9) descriptively anchored at six points in terms of their propensity to
consider interpersonal interactions and personal reactions in mental state terms.
Examples of the different levels of RF are provided in Table 1. To obtain a generalindicator of children’s RF (CRF-G), the mean RF of all the coded responses was used. Thescale alpha was .94, and item-total correlations ranged from .57 to .79, conﬁrming that thetotal score (CRF-G) could be used as a good indicator of overall RF. Because of theoreticalconsiderations and previous ﬁndings with adults indicating that self- and otherunderstanding may have distinct implications, self and other items were treated asseparate scales. (A factor analysis is not reported given that the sample was composed in
part of children with histories of sexual abuse involving their fathers and that this may
have had an effect on their mentalization regarding fathers that may be particular to thissample and would be unlikely to be replicated in other samples.)
To obtain an indicator of children’s RF regarding themselves (CRF-S), the mean RF for
the four items eliciting self-descriptions and the child’s reactions in response to upsettingevents was used. Furthermore, an indicator of CRF-Other (CRF-O) was calculated based onthe mean RF on the nine questions regarding the child’s relationships with their parentsand a description of parents’ reactions when upset or when they argue. Inter –rater
reliability of the CRFS items has been reported to be good, with intraclass coefﬁcientsMentalization in middle childhood and trauma 207

RF Scores Example
Bizarre, disorganized response
mentalization is avoided“When was the last time you felt it was fun to be with
mom?” –“Uhhh ...there’s a poem there, fun to be with
mom ...I’m fun to be with mom ...I’ve got this video of
Sesame Street ...”(/C01)
Absence of mentalization “What happens when dad gets upset with you?” –“I don’t
know, it just is” (0)
Self description in terms of
behavior, non-mental
characteristics“I have lots of energy, I am athletic. I take part in lots of
sports” (1)
Descriptions are given without
explicit reference to mental
states“It is fun to be with mum” The child then gives the
following example. “Sometimes on a Saturday she says
come let me treat you, and we go to the shopping centreand I can try out a dress, or some jewelry, and then we
go to McDonalds and have something to eat” (2)
Some vague, basic but
unelaborated references tomental states“I am friendly and helpful, I enjoy helping my friends, I
always know how to solve things on the computer” (3)
The child may recognize that
when they experience anegative affect, their own
behavior may elicit responses
from others, which in turn canhelp to soothe or regulate their
affect in various ways“When I get sad, Mom like, comforts me” (4)
Clear description which shows a
solid mental state understandingWhat happens when your mum gets upset? “It is usually
about homework. By 5 pm I have had enough and I
cannot stomach anymore, but it isn’t ﬁnished. So then I
ask my mum if I can do something else” and she says“only if you have ﬁnished your homework. And I say “Ican’t stand it anymore” and she says “it is your
responsibility to ﬁnish it, I can’t do it in your place.” and
she says, “I don’t want to see you before you haveﬁnished it unless you want to see me get angry.” But I am
frustrated, so I argue with her and get angry with her, but
I know she is right and that I have to do it. There is noother way around it” (5)
Clearly communicates the fact
that she knows what she feels,but intentionally hides this“I am so angry at her ...but I would never show that to
her” (6)
Reﬂects an understanding that
different people may perceive a
given behavior or situationdifferently often based on
differing knowledge of the
situation or false belief“She was upset because she thought the secret was about
her but it wasn’t. I did not know how to reassure her and
keep the secret at the same time, and whatever I said,she just became more and more convinced it was about
her” (7)

(ICCs) ranging from .60 to 1.00, with a median of .93 (Ensink, 2004). Temporal stability of
children’s RF was shown to be high over a 3-month period and adequate over 12 months(Ensink, 2004). Coding was carried out by the ﬁrst author and two doctoral studentstrained by the ﬁrst author to 85% agreement. This level of reliability was achieved after12 hr of training. Coders were blind to the status of the case. Every effort was made toremove indicators from the transcript that might have indicated the participant’s abusestatus, although this was a limited problem as few children disclosed abuse-relatedinformation. Responses were screened for inadvertent indications of group identity by the
interviewer, and all identifying references were either deleted in their entirety or key
indicative content was blanked out (e.g., references to investigations and sexual abusewere taken out of the text).
Maternal RF
Maternal RF was measured with the Parent Development Interview (PDI) Addendum tothe ARFS (Fonagy et al. , 1998). The PDI-R (Slade, Bernbach, Grienenberger, Levy, &
Locker, 2004) is a 45-item interview developed to assess parental representations of the
child and of the parent –child relationship. Reliability estimates produced using ICCs
range from .78 to .95 (Slade, Grienenberger, Bernbach, Levy, & Locker, 2005). Theinterview was videotaped and transcribed for coding purposes. Each demand questionwas coded with reference to the manual, which provides illustrations of different typesand levels of RF responses. An overall RF score (ranging from /C01 to 9) was assigned
using the manualized guidelines. All protocols were coded by the ﬁrst and secondauthor of the study, both trained to code parental RF. Protocols were allocated so that
the ﬁrst author never coded both parent and child measures for any dyad. Inter –rater
reliability was calculated on 20% of protocols and was satisfactory (ICCs ranged from.67 to .98 and reached .93 for the global PDI score).Table 1. (Continued )

accept that he is part of the family and they cannot justthrow him away, but at the time I could not understand

Results
Child RF and mothers’ RF in the clinical and comparison groups
Preliminary analyses
First, inter –rater reliability of the CRFS was calculated on 30% of protocols and was
demonstrated to be excellent (ICCs ranging f r o m. 8 0t o. 9 0 ) .F u r t h e r m o r e ,a n dp r i o rt o
testing the hypotheses, we examined the distribution of RF and explored the data for
potential confounding variables. Gender differences in CRF-S, F(1, 93) =.01,p>.05, and
CRFS-O, F(1, 93) =.02,p>.05, were not signiﬁcant. The distribution of RF scores was
normal/somewhat skewed for both children and parents but not sufﬁciently to necessitatethe use of nonparametric statistics for hypothesis testing. Child RF was signiﬁcantlycorrelated with age, and thus, the effect of age was controlled in multiple regression analyses.
Child RF
From a descriptive viewpoint, mean CRF-G scores were very low for the sexually abused
group ( M=2.08, SD=1.44, SE=.21, Min =/C00.25, Max =6.92) and, also, to a lesser
extent, in the comparison group ( M=3.25, SD=1.02, SE=.15, Min =1.17,
Max =5.83). The difference between the two groups was signiﬁcant, t(93) =4.51,
p<.001, and, using conventional interpretative criteria (Cohen, 1988), could be
considered large as the mean of the abused group was at the 79th percentile of thecomparison group (Hedges’ g=.94, 95% CI: 0.65 –1.67). Thus, child sexual abuse was
associated with increased difﬁculties in mentalization.
When total RF scores were broken down into separate indicators of CRF-S and CRF-O,
mentalization capacities were, again, at the lower end of the spectrum. More speciﬁcally,CRF-S was very low in the sexually abused group ( M=2.22, SD=1.76, SE=.25,
Min=/C00.50, Max =7.75) and, also, but to a certain degree only, in the comparison
group ( M=3.38, SD=1.08, SE=.16, Min =1.25, Max =
5.5). This difference was
signiﬁcant, t(93) =3.84, p<.001, and, reﬂected a medium to large effect (Hedges’
g=.79, 95% CI: 0.56 –1.76). Mentalization capacities about others as measured by CRF-O
showed a similar pattern of ﬁndings for the sexually abused ( M=2.01,
SD=1.39, SE=.20, Min =/C00.13, Max =6.5) and comparison ( M=3.15, SD=1.09,
SE=.16, Min =1.0, Max =6.0) groups. Again, this difference was signiﬁcant,
t(93) =4.44, p<.001, and the effect size was large (Hedges’ g=.92, 95% CI: 0.63 –1.65).
Finally, to determine whether there were signiﬁcant differences in the RF of children
who experienced intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse, additional comparisonswere made within the clinical group. At the combined self/other understanding (CRF-G)level, the mentalization capacities of children who had suffered intrafamilial abuse(M=1.65, SD=1.06, SE=.22, Min =/C00.25, Max =4.33) were somewhat lower than
those of children in the extrafamilial group ( M=2.49, SD=1.63, SE=.33, Min =0.00,
Max =6.92), and this difference was signiﬁcant, t(93) =2.13, p=.04 (Hedges’ g=.62,
95% CI: 0.05 –1.64). When these results were subdivided into separate dimensions of RF
regarding self and other, CRF-S proved to be signiﬁcantly lower in cases of intrafamilialabuse ( M=
1.70, SD=1.50, SE=.31, Min =/C00.50, Max =6.50) than in cases of

t(93) =1.99, p=.05 (Hedges’ g=.58, 95% CI: /C00.01 to 1.55).
Mothers’ RF
Mothers’ RF varied from very low to rudimentary and was signiﬁcantly lower in theintrafamilial sexual abuse ( M=2.61, SD=1.64, SE=.34, Min =/C01.0, Max =6) and
extrafamilial sexual abuse ( M=3.12, SD=1.86, SE=.37, Min =.05, Max =6) groups
than in the comparison group ( M=4.35, SD=1.66, SE=.25, Min =2.2, Max =7.65),
F(2, 93) =9.23, p<.001. The effect size associated with this group difference was large
(Hedges’ g=.86, 95% CI: 0.77 –2.77).
Prediction of Child RF
Correlational analyses revealed that children’s age ( r=.28, p<.01, r=.27, p<.01
andr=.26,p<.05) and maternal RF ( r=.33,p<.01,
r=.32,p<.01 and r=.31,
p<.01) were, respectively, related to CRF-G, as well as to CRF-S and CRF-O. To better
circumscribe the unique effects of this set of predictors, and because CRF-S and CRF-Owere not perfectly dependent ( r=.79,p<.01), three separate hierarchical multiple
regression analyses were conducted: one to predict CRF-G, one to predict CRF-S, and
one to predict CRF-O. In all three analyses, child age was entered ﬁrst, followed by
mothers’ RF and ﬁnally sexual abuse status (dummy coded abused vs. comparison, withthe comparison participants serving as the reference group). The results of theseanalyses are presented in Table 2. In the ﬁrst analysis examining predictors of CRF-G,child age, mothers’ RF, and sexual abuse status were all signiﬁcant unique predictors ofCRF-G. More speciﬁcally, being an older child, having mothers with elevated RF and theabsence of sexual abuse were associated with higher global RF in children. However,when abuse status was entered, the association between CRF-G and mothers’ RF
became marginally signiﬁcant. In the second analysis examining predictors of CRF-S,
child age, mothers’ RF, and sexual abuse status were signiﬁcant predictors of CRF-S.Again, as with CRF-G, when abuse status was entered, the association between CRF-Sand mothers’ RF became marginally signiﬁcant. In the third analysis examiningpredictors of CRF-O, child age and sexual abuse signiﬁcantly predicted CRF-O but theeffect of mothers’ RF became nonsigniﬁcant when abuse status was entered into theequation.
Finally, to ascertain whether intrafamilial and extrafamilial child sexual abuse were
independent contributors to explained variance in CRF-G, CRF-S, and CRF-O, previous
regression analyses were repeated and the role of abuse was assessed by creating a three-category dummy variable, with control children as the reference group. The resultsshowed that intrafamilial and extrafamilial sexual abuse were independent contributors toexplained variance in CRF-G ( b=/C0.44,p<.001, for intrafamilial abuse and b=/C0.22,
p<.05, for extrafamilial abuse) and CRF-O ( b=/C0.40,p<.001, for intrafamilial abuse
andb=/C0.22, p<.05, for extrafamilial abuse). For CRF-S, only intrafamilial abuse
(b=/C0.36,p<.001) was speciﬁcally related to child RF.
Discussion
This study extends the literature on mentalization in middle childhood in three important
ways. First, the CRFS used to code the CAI proved reliable with excellent intraclassMentalization in middle childhood and trauma 211

correlation coefﬁcients, conﬁrming that it is possible to reliably measure mentalization
(RF) in children aged from 7 to 12 years old from the narratives they produce regardingthemselves and their relationships with attachment ﬁgures.
Second, the association between child sexual abuse and RF supports the criterion
validity of the observational coding system speciﬁcally developed to assess mentalizationwith the CAI. This conclusion rests on several complementary empirical ﬁndings. Forexample, when looking at children’s mentalization capacities in general (CRF-G), thedifference between children who had histories of sexual abuse and the comparison group
from the community was not only signiﬁcant but, by conventional criteria, represented a
large effect size. By comparison, the mean RF of children in the normative group indicatesthat they had developed the capacity to use a rudimentary level of emotional and mentalstate terms in thinking about themselves and others. The mean RF of the normative groupwas lower than expected in middle class samples, likely due to the fact that the controlgroup in this study was matched on socio-economic variables with the abuse group.Signiﬁcant differences between the sexual abuse and comparison group were also evidentwhen using separate indicators to operationalize children’s RF regarding themself (CRF-S)Table 2.

and others (CRF-O), two important domains of mentalization abilities. These differences
were, respectively, of moderate and large magnitude and were maintained even aftercontrolling for children’s age and maternal RF. These ﬁndings conﬁrm that child sexualabuse is associated with mentalization difﬁculties in both the domains of CRF-S and CRF-O.
Furthermore, even if these comparisons had less statistical power, children with histories
of intrafamilial abuse, when compared to children who experienced extrafamilial sexualabuse, had signiﬁcantly lower mentalization capacities in general (CRF-G). Morespeciﬁcally, children who had experienced intrafamilial sexual abuse had signiﬁcantlylower mentalization capacities regarding self (CRF-S) and others (CRF-O), suggesting thatintrafamilial abuse has a more severe impact on children’s capacity to think of self andothers in coherent mental state terms than extrafamilial abuse.
Third, maternal RF was associated with child CRF-G, including CRF-S and CRF-O. These
ﬁndings extend the growing body of research demonstrating the importance of maternal
inﬂuences in particular on the development of children’s ToM and emotionalunderstanding (Sharp & Fonagy, 2008a,b). The relation between maternal and child RFis likely to be mediated by the mother’s capacity to imagine the child as a person andpsychological being and communicate this to the child and then elaborate or co-constructan understanding with the child. The ﬁndings of this study suggest that by middlechildhood, the magnitude of this effect is at best moderate.
In addition to conﬁrming the reliability and validity of the CRFS coding system, the
study also produced a number of additional ﬁndings that contribute to understanding
mentalization in children with histories of sexual abuse and their mothers. The ﬁndingswith regard to speciﬁc difﬁculties in CRF-G, CRF-S, and CRF-O in children with histories ofsexual abuse add to the existing evidence of delayed ToM (Cicchetti et al. , 2003; Pears &
Fisher, 2005), dissociation, as well as problems in identity and incoherence of parentalrepresentations in maltreated children (Macﬁe, Cicchetti, & Toth, 2001). In addition, theﬁndings of the study draw attention to speciﬁc difﬁculties children who have experiencedsexual abuse, and particularly intrafamilial sexual abuse, have in mentalizing regarding
themselves and others. These difﬁculties are likely to contribute to subsequent difﬁculties
with identity, sense of self and intimate relationships, which in turn can be hypothesizedto increase vulnerability in the context of further stress, and the risk of developing a formof psychopathology in adolescence or adulthood.
Two different patterns emerged when examining the predictors of children’s RF-O and
RF-S in the context of abuse. The ﬁndings of the regression analyses indicate that bothmaternal RF and sexual abuse made independent contributions to explaining variance inCRF-S. This suggests that the impact of maternal RF remains important for CRF-S, even
when considering the impact of abuse and the multiple levels through which it can disrupt
children’s mentalization capacities regarding themselves. This is consistent with Fonagyand Target’s (2006) developmental model where the early sense of self crystalizes aroundthe experience of being treated by a caregiver as a psychological being with a mind andwhere the child develops a sense of self and identity through interactions with a caregiverthat reﬂects on his mind. In addition to maternal RF, sexual abuse also made a signiﬁcantcontribution to explaining variance in CRF-S. Abuse may contribute to a phobic avoidanceof mentalizing and thinking about emotional reactions out of fear of encountering
unbearable feelings and thoughts related to the trauma (Briere, Hodges, & Godbout, 2010;
Schwarz, 2002).
Sexual abuse was the only variable that explained variance in CRF-O, as the
contribution of maternal RF was no longer signiﬁcant after abuse was entered. Oneexplanation of these ﬁndings could be that the experience of abuse and trauma inﬂictedMentalization in middle childhood and trauma 213

intentionally disrupts trust, openness, and curiosity and installs an aversion to considering
the intentions and minds of others given the frankly destructive intentions towards him orher that the child must infer from the abusive act. In addition, sexual abuse in the contextof attachment relationships and the family may produce a decoupling or inhibition of
mentalization that helps children adapt to situations where they cannot avoid a member of
the family who abuse them or where they are dependent on attachment ﬁgures whoprovoke fear.
In this study, the CRFS made it possible to identify important deﬁcits in mentalization
associated with child sexual abuse. There are important limitations to this study thatshould be considered before making conclusions based on these ﬁndings. The sample sizewas relatively small, although adequate for testing the hypotheses of this study.Undoubtedly, there was substantial heterogeneity in the sample, the range and context of
the sexual abuse was highly variable, and many children may have experienced additional
forms of maltreatment. Furthermore, the sample certainly was not of a sufﬁcient size toexplore the implication of this heterogeneity on CAI-RF outcomes. The ﬁndings of thepresent study provides preliminary support for the validity of the CRFS, but further work isneeded to examine whether children’s psychological understanding of self and others hasthe expected implications for self-concept, social adaptation, and psychopathology. Atpresent, there is no measure that can be considered the gold standard of mentalizationcapacities or psychological understanding of children and against which the CRFS can
thus be compared. However, further research is needed to clarify the relationship
between child RF and related constructs such as emotional understanding and ToM.
The validation of CRFS potentially opens the door for child researchers to join
researchers working with adult populations and to examine the implications ofmentalization capacities in psychopathology. The use of the CRFS does require aninvestment in training as well as in transcribing and coding the interview, but the trainingand coding is relatively less complex than that needed to rate attachment. It is likely topresent a worthwhile investment for researchers given the lack of alternative measures.
Furthermore, many child researchers have already been trained to use the CAI to assess
attachment in school-aged children and could use the CRFS to examine the speciﬁccontribution of mentalization capacities.
Conclusion
The ﬁndings conﬁrm that the CRF scale is a reliable and valid measure that can be used toidentify clinically relevant mentalization difﬁculties and have important research and
clinical implications for assessing and understanding the repercussions of child sexual
abuse. Sexual abuse, especially intrafamilial sexual abuse, was found to be associated withsigniﬁcant difﬁculties in mentalization in children as well as their mothers. The ﬁndingsunderscore the importance of maternal RF for the development of CRF-S. It is apparentthat in the context of sexual abuse, children and mothers frequently do not considermental states and see beyond behaviour. This is likely to make it challenging to understandchildren’s psychological reactions consequent to abuse and respond appropriatelywithout additional help and intervention.
