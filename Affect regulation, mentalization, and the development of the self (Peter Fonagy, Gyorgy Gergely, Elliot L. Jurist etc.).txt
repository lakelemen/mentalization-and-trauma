Acknowledgments 
We would like to acknowledge first of all our gratitude to our 
patients; some of the ideas in this book have been prompted by 
our clinical work, and one important yardstick in judging the 
ideas is whether they can help us better to understand our 
experiences with patients past, present, and future. We hope 
that our efforts toward new theoretical understanding have 
sometimes benefited them in turn. 
This book could not and would not have been produced 
without the outstanding contribution of Dr. Elizabeth Allison, 
the Publications Editor of the Psychoanalysis Unit at UCL. Her 
contribution went very significantly over what might be expected 
from someone in this role. She effectively conceived and organ­
ized the project, as well as offering superb advice on the integra­
tion of the chapters and the dovetailing of arguments. We are 
sure that many gaps have remained, but the level of integration 
we were able to achieve is in large part due to her remarkable 
intellectual abilities and brilliant editorial skills. What is more, 
she was able to impose her editorial and intellectual discipline 
on all of us with charm and sensitivity. Liz, we are all immensely 
indebted to you. 
In writing this book we have been immensely fortunate. Liz's 
predecessor in the Publications Editor post was Kathy Leach, 
xi 

xii / Acknowledgments 
whose contribution was enormously valuable, not only in the 
planning phases of the project, but also in preparing for publica­
tion many of the pieces on which the present work relies. Our 
only regret is that despite ingenious, tactful, and sometimes 
desperate efforts to keep the production of this book to schedule, 
we were not able to reward her with a complete manuscript. 
We are also grateful to our publisher. Dr. Michael Moskowitz, 
whose vision about a new kind of psychoanalytic press we share 
and are extremely pleased to be participating in. We are particu­
larly grateful for his patience, as this book, born of work in four 
countries and on two continents, slowly progressed to final 
completion. In terms of intellectual debt, more people deserve 
acknowledgment than we could possibly list. The contribu­
tions of two people, however, have been clearly formative: John 
Watson of the University of California at Berkeley has collabo­
rated for many years with one of us (GG), but all of us have 
benefited from his writings and wisdom. Even in these days of 
virtual workplaces, this collaboration would not have been possi­
ble without a common workplace that at least three of the four of 
us share. Dr. Efrain Bleiberg's leadership of the Menninger 
Clinic during the time that the work reported here was under­
taken has made it possible for us to work together in the Child 
and Family Center of the Menninger Clinic, which Dr. Bleiberg 
created and supervised in a truly free intellectual spirit. Others 
at the Child and Family Center, particularly Dr. Jon Allen and 
Dr. Helen Stein, have offered inspiration and advice. Two addi­
tional colleagues have been a source of inspiration and guidance: 
Dr. Susan Coates has followed our work over the years, as 
indeed we have followed hers with admiration. She has set a 
path in developmental clinical psychoanalysis that has been a 
true inspiration. Dr. Arietta Slade has inspired us not only in her 
research work, clinical skills, and scholarship, but the Integra­
tion of all these into one personality with exceptional spirit and 
charm. We are grateful to her for her friendship as well as her 
guidance.

Introduction 
Numerous paths come together in this book. Drawing from 
a wide range of sources, we ambitiously aim to address multi­
ple audiences: research psychologists, clinical psychologists, 
and psychotherapists, but also developmentalists from across 
other disciplines. From the most general perspective, we wish 
to highlight the crucial importance of developmental work to 
psychotherapy and psychopathology. We offer an account of 
psychotherapy that seeks to integrate our scientific knowledge of 
psychological development with our experience as clinicians, 
working with children and adults. We believe that the interests 
of our patients are best served by a constant effort on the part 
both of individual therapists and of the profession collectively to 
bring about such an integration. The value of this kind of inte­
gration is by no means immediately accepted (see Green 2000; 
Wolff 1996), nor should it be. The psychotherapist offers clinical 
help, mainly though language, to people looking for help not 
(just) from medication, but from someone who is willing to have 
their minds in mind. It cannot be assumed that scientific pro­
gress in adjacent disciplines will benefit psychotherapeutic 
practice. For example, we can well imagine that progress in 
Hullian or Skinnerian learning-theory research in the 1940s and 
1950s would have been of little help to psychodynamic thera­
pists at that time. Learning theory benefited quite a different 

2 / Introduction 
kind of psychological therapy, less concerned with meaning and 
the person than with behavior and the environment. 
Our work can be located within the well-established tradition 
of interest within psychoanalysis in developmental theory and 
research found among giants like Anna Freud, Melanie Klein, 
Mahler, Brody, Emde, Stern, and many others. A particularly 
inspiring example of the seamless integration of developmental 
and clinical thought may be found in a book by Anni Bergman 
(1999), Margaret Mahler's well-known collaborator. Many of the 
ideas in Bergman's book will be found here, perhaps cast in 
somewhat different perspective. All developmental orientations 
to psychotherapy must share many important features as they 
are all based on the observation of human development. At the 
same time, we believe that a number of the ideas discussed in 
this book—such as the social biofeedback theory of parental 
mirroring, the teleological and Intentional stance, reflective func­
tion, the psychic equivalence and pretend modes of psychic 
reality, the alien self, mentalizing, affectivity, and, of course, 
affect regulation and mentalization—suggest a genuinely new 
direction for psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. 
From another perspective, however, this book is not limited to 
psychoanalytic ideas and concerns. We apply a philosophy-of-
mind approach in order to capture and specify the process by 
which infants fathom the minds of others and eventually their 
own minds. The notion that we fathom ourselves through others 
has its source in German Idealism and has been articulated 
further by analytic philosophers of mind (Jurist 2000). The use 
of philosophy of mind in this way is common in the field of social 
cognition. What differentiates our approach is the attention we 
give not just to cognition, but to affects as well. In this regard, we 
rely on attachment theory, which provides empirical support for 
the notion that an infant's sense of self emerges from the affec­
tive quality of relationship with the primary caregiver. Indeed, 
our work does not just borrow from attachment theory, but 
offers a significant reformulation of it. We shall argue that at­
tachment is not an end in itself; rather, it exists in order to 
produce a representational system that has evolved, we may 
presume, to aid human survival. Another way to think about the 
contribution of this book, therefore, is as an effort to resolve Introduction / 3 
some of the historical tensions between psychoanalysis and 
attachment theory (Fonagy 2001). 
Let us say a little more about the main theme of this work 
and its relation to the trio of terms found in our title. Our main 
focus throughout is on -the development of representations of 
psychological states in the minds of infants, children, adoles­
cents, and adults. Mentalization—a concept that is familiar in 
developmental circles—is the process by which we realize that 
having a mind mediates our experience of the world. Mentaliza­
tion is intrinsically linked to the development of the self, to its 
gradually elaborated inner organization, and to its participation 
in human society, a network of human relationships with other 
beings who share this unique capacity. We have used the term 
"reflective function" to refer to our operationalization of the 
mental capacities that generate mentalization'(Fonagy, Target, 
Steele, and Steele 1998). 
Mentalization is intimately related to the development of both 
the agentive and the representational aspects of the self: both 
the "I" and the "Me" described by W. James (1890). A great deal 
of attention has been paid to the development of self-representa­
tion, James's "Me" or the "empirical self" (Lewis and Brooks-
Gunn 1979), which encompasses the development of the set of 
characteristics that we believe to be true of ourselves even if this 
knowledge is inferred from the reactions to us from our social 
environment (Harter 1999). Thus, this aspect of mentalization is 
a concept with a rich history in both psychoanalytic theory 
(Fonagy 1991) and cognitive psychology (Morton and Frith 1995). 
However, the self as a mental agent—or, as we have referred to it 
elsewhere, the psychological self (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 
1993; Fonagy and Target 1995)—is a relatively neglected subject 
of study. The relative neglect by psychologists and psychoana­
lysts of the developmental processes that underpin the agentive 
self may be seen as a residue of the traditionally powerful 
Cartesian doctrine of first-person authority that claims direct 
and infallible introspective access to intentional mind states, 
rather than seeing this access as a hard-won developmental 
acquisition. The work of Marcia Cavell (1988, 1994, 2000), 
among others, serves as a reminder of the limited extent to 
which psychoanalytic metapsychology has been able to distance

our work does not just borrow from attachment theory, but 
offers a significant reformulation of it. We shall argue that at­
tachment is not an end in itself; rather, it exists in order to 
produce a representational system that has evolved, we may 
presume, to aid human survival. Another way to think about the 
contribution of this book, therefore, is as an effort to resolve Introduction / 3 
some of the historical tensions between psychoanalysis and 
attachment theory (Fonagy 2001). 
Let us say a little more about the main theme of this work 
and its relation to the trio of terms found in our title. Our main 
focus throughout is on -the development of representations of 
psychological states in the minds of infants, children, adoles­
cents, and adults. Mentalization—a concept that is familiar in 
developmental circles—is the process by which we realize that 
having a mind mediates our experience of the world. Mentaliza­
tion is intrinsically linked to the development of the self, to its 
gradually elaborated inner organization, and to its participation 
in human society, a network of human relationships with other 
beings who share this unique capacity. We have used the term 
"reflective function" to refer to our operationalization of the 
mental capacities that generate mentalization'(Fonagy, Target, 
Steele, and Steele 1998). 
Mentalization is intimately related to the development of both 
the agentive and the representational aspects of the self: both 
the "I" and the "Me" described by W. James (1890). A great deal 
of attention has been paid to the development of self-representa­
tion, James's "Me" or the "empirical self" (Lewis and Brooks-
Gunn 1979), which encompasses the development of the set of 
characteristics that we believe to be true of ourselves even if this 
knowledge is inferred from the reactions to us from our social 
environment (Harter 1999). Thus, this aspect of mentalization is 
a concept with a rich history in both psychoanalytic theory 
(Fonagy 1991) and cognitive psychology (Morton and Frith 1995). 
However, the self as a mental agent—or, as we have referred to it 
elsewhere, the psychological self (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 
1993; Fonagy and Target 1995)—is a relatively neglected subject 
of study. The relative neglect by psychologists and psychoana­
lysts of the developmental processes that underpin the agentive 
self may be seen as a residue of the traditionally powerful 
Cartesian doctrine of first-person authority that claims direct 
and infallible introspective access to intentional mind states, 
rather than seeing this access as a hard-won developmental 
acquisition. The work of Marcia Cavell (1988, 1994, 2000), 
among others, serves as a reminder of the limited extent to 
which psychoanalytic metapsychology has been able to distance

itself from Cartesian doctrine. Both psychoanalysis and develop­
mental science have often adhered to the Cartesian tradition in 
their assumption that the experience of mental agency is 
innately given. In this book we attempt a radical break with 
this dominant philosophical tradition, arguing that mental agen­
cy may be more usefully seen as a developing or constructed 
capacity. 
Developmental and philosophical studies of the representa­
tion of intentional action have revealed that the representation of 
intentional mind states may have a rather complex internal 
structure. Conscious access to these structures may be at best 
partial and could be totally absent. It seems to us important that 
we map the process by means of which the understanding of the 
self as a mental agent grows out of interpersonal experience, 
particularly primary-object relationships. Mentalization involves 
both a self-reflective and an interpersonal component. In combi­
nation, these provide the child with a capacity to distinguish 
inner from outer reality, intrapersonal mental and emotional 
processes from interpersonal communications. In this book we 
present both clinical and empirical evidence in conjunction with 
developmental observation to demonstrate that the baby's expe­
rience of himself as an organism with a mind or psychological 
self is not a genetic given.1 It is a structure that evolves from 
infancy through childhood, and its development critically de­
pends upon interaction with more mature minds, who are both 
benign and reflective in their turn. 
Our understanding of mentalization is not just as a cognitive 
process, but developmentally commences with the "discovery" of 
affects through the primary-object relationships. For this rea­
son, we focus on the concept of "affect regulation," which is 
important in many spheres of developmental theory and theories 
of psychopathology (e.g., Clarkin and Lenzenweger 1996). Affect 
regulation, the capacity to modulate affect states, is closely 
related to mentalization in that it plays a fundamental role in the 
unfolding of a sense of self and agency. In our account, affect

parent or the therapist as "she." This is not meant to suggest any difference 
between male and female babies or male and female parents or therapists. Introduction / 5 
regulation-is a prelude to mentalization; yet, we also believe that 
once mentalization has occurred, the nature of affect regulation 
is transformed. Here we distinguish between affect regulation as 
a kind of adjustment of affect states and a more sophisticated 
variation, where affects are used to regulate the self. The concept 
of "mentalized affectivity" marks a mature capacity for the regu­
lation of affect and denotes the capacity to discover the subjec­
tive meanings of one's own affect states. Mentalized affectivity 
lies, we suggest, at the core of the psychotherapeutic enterprise. 
It represents the experiential understanding of one's feelings in a 
way that extends beyond intellectual understanding. It is in this 
realm that we encounter resistances and defenses, not just 
against specific emotional experiences, but against entire modes 
of psychological functioning; not just distortions of mental repre­
sentations standing in the way of therapeutic progress, but also 
inhibitions of mental functioning (Fonagy, Edgcumbe, Moran, 
Kennedy, and Target 1993). Thus we can misunderstand what 
we feel, thinking that we feel one thing while truly feeling an­
other emotion. Moreover, it is even possible that we can deprive 
ourselves of the entire experiential world of emotional richness. 
For example, the inability to envision psychological and psycho­
social causation may be the consequence of the pervasive inhibi­
tion and/or developmental malformation of the psychological 
processes that underpin these capacities. 
Our theory of affect regulation and mentalization enables us 
to enrich the arguments advanced by theorists such as John 
Bowlby about the evolutionary function of attachment. We argue 
that an evolutionary function, of early object relations is to equip 
the very young child with an environment within which the 
understanding of mental states in others and the self can fully 
develop. We propose that self-reflection as well as the ability to 
reflect on other minds are constructed capacities that have 
evolved (or not) out of the earliest-relationships. Since mentaliza­
tion is a core aspect of human social functioning, we can infer 
that evolution has placed particular value on developing mental 
structures for interpreting interpersonal actions. Language is, of 
course, the major channel for symbolic interaction. Yet, in order 
for language to function adequately, the subjective world re­
quires organization. Internal states must have a meaning in

order to be communicated to others and interpreted in others to

It should be readily apparent that this book places consider­
able emphasis on early social experience as a primary moderator 
of the mental capacities centrally involved in psychological disor­
ders and their psychotherapeutic treatment. In this respect the 
work is a continuation of a psychosocial tradition that has seen 
parenting practices and the early social environment as the key 
to developmental psychopathology (Cicchetti and Cohen 1995; A. 
Freud 1981; Masten and Braswell 1991; Rutter 1993; Sameroff 
1995; Sroufe 1996). We recognize that this perspective, while 
undoubtedly dominant in psychiatry and social science during 
most of the past century, has come under increasing critical 
scrutiny in the light of more recent evidence from behavior-
genetic adoption and twin studies (Eaves et al. 1997; Hewitt et 
al. 1997). It is very probably true that past studies might have 
overestimated the influence of the social environment on devel­
opment because they failed to control for genetic influences. We 
note, however, that current psychiatric literature is showing 
signs of a return of a naively nativist perspective, where genetic 
data are viewed as indicating that a psychological level of analy­
sis cannot be productive. Consequently, early environment is 
given little significance, and such significance as is accorded to it 
is from a physical rather than a psychological perspective (e.g., 
Marenco and Weinberger 2000). 
While it is clear that psychological principles cannot violate 
the limitations set by the neurophysiological capabilities of the 
systems that subserve them, .this does not imply the reduction of 
psychology to biology. In this book we take issue with the "genet-
icization" of human behavior. We adopt a position in line with 
that of the evolutionists Dobzhansky (1972) and Gould (1987). 
We consider that nature (genetics or genes) operates as a "poten-
tialist" rather than as a "determinist." Since biological determin­
ism is frequently clothed in the language of malleability and 
interactionism, we note that in reality, behind these more palat­
able portrayals of biology, genes are still considered the primary-
ruling force. While changeability of evolved dispositions is ac­
knowledged, these inherited traits are then seen as predomi-Introduction / 7 
nant. We suggest that this tendency can occur because of the 
absence of convincing data on gene-environment interaction. Yet 
modern genetics has provided ample room for the contention 
that biology has culture on a "loose" rather than a "tight leash" 
(Gould 1987). 
We attribute the failure of behavior geneticists to find 
convincing evidence for gene-environment interaction to their 
predisposition to study the "wrong" environment: the physical 
rather than the psychological. We suggest that the decline of 
interest in subjectivity, in the mechanism that interprets the 
social world, is partly to blame for this gap in our knowledge. We 
argue that it is the manner in which the environment is experi­
enced that acts as a filter in the expression of genotype into 
phenotype. The intrapsychic representational processes that un­
derpin the agentive self are not just the consequences of both 
environmental and genetic effects. They may acquire additional 
importance as moderators of the effects of the environment upon 
the unfolding of genotype into phenotype. We place mentaliza­
tion at the heart of this process of moderation, since it is the 
interpretation ofthe social environment rather than the physical 
environment that governs genetic expression. 
These considerations have led us to reformulate our under­
standing of the impact of early social relationships on later 
experience. We move away from the model where an early rela­
tionship is principally seen as the generator of a template for 
later relationships (e.g., Bowlby 1980). Instead, we argue that 
early experience, no doubt via its impact on development at 
both psychological and neurophysiological levels, determines the 
"depth" to which the social environment may be processed. 
Suboptimal early experiences of care affect later development by 
undermining the individual's capacity to process or interpret 
information concerning mental states that is essential for effec­
tive functioning in a stressful social world. Insecurity in attach­
ment relationships is a signal of limitation in mentalizing skills. 
We find that the traditional classification of attachment patterns 
may be helpfully reinterpreted in this context as indication of a 
relatively good (secure attachment), or relatively poor (insecure 
attachment) capacity to manage or cope with intimate Inter-

personal relationships. An absence of mentalizing capacity un­
der stress is signaled by the disorganization of the attachment 
system. 
So what aspect of the environment can be specified as critical 
to the healthy development of an agentive or psychological self? 
Attuned interactions with the parent (Jaffe, Beebe, Feldstein, 
Crown, and Jasnow 2001; Stern 1985) often involve affect-mir­
roring—that is, the parent's use of facial and vocal expression to 
represent to the child the feelings she assumes him to have in 
such a way as to reassure and calm rather than intensify his 
emotions. We see parental affect-mirroring as instrumental in 
fostering the capacity for affect regulation, through the creation 
of a second-order representation for constitutional affect states. 
The image of the caregiver mirroring the internal experience of 
the infant comes to organize the child's emotional experience. 
Thus the self is not merely open to environmental influence: it is 
in part constituted through its interactions with the social envi­
ronment. Freud, arguably, saw infancy as a time when the self 
saw others as extensions of itself (e.g., Freud 1900a). Our em­
phasis is the reverse—we see the self as originally an extension 
of experience of the other. 
We propose two intimately connected developmental theories. 
Both concern the relationship between the acquisition of an 
understanding of the representational nature of minds on the 
one hand and affect regulation on the other. The social biofeed­
back theory of parental affect-mirroring explores the way in 
which the infant's automatic emotion expression and the care­
giver's consequent affect-reflective facial and vocal displays come 
to be linked in the infant's mind through a contingency-detection 
mechanism Identified by John Watson and colleagues (Bahrick 
and Watson 1985; Gergely and Watson 1996; Watson 1972, 
1994). (This mechanism is described quite fully in chapter 4.) 
The forging of this link has two important effects: (a) The infants 
come to associate the control they have over their parents' 
mirroring displays with the resulting improvement, in their emo­
tional state, leading, eventually, to an experience of the self as a 
regulating agent, (b) The establishment of a second-order repre­
sentation of affect states creates-the basis for affect regulation 
and impulse control. Affects can be manipulated and discharged Introduction / 9 
internally as well as through action; they can also be experienced 
as something recognizable and hence shared. Affect expressions 
by the parent that are not contingent on the infant's affect will 
undermine the appropriate labeling of internal states, which 
may, in turn, remain confusing, experienced as unsymbolized, 
and hard to regulate. 
For affect-mirroring to serve as the basis ofthe development 
of a representational framework, the caregiver must somehow 
indicate that her display is not for real: it is not an indication of 
how the parent herself feels. We describe this characteristic of 
the parent's mirroring behavior as its "markedness." A display 
that is congruent with the baby's state but lacks markedness 
may overwhelm the infant. It is felt to be the parent's own real 
emotion, making the infant's experience seem contagious, or 
universal, and thus more dangerous. In the short term, the 
infant's perception of a corresponding but realistic negative emo­
tion is likely to escalate rather than regulate the infant's state, 
leading to traumatization rather than containment. 
Our second theory concerns the nature of subjectivity before 
recognition ofthe representational character ofthe human mind. 
We suggest that the infant's and young child's early awareness of 
mental states is characterized by the equation of the internal 
with the external. What exists in the mind must exist out there, 
and what exists out there must invariably also exist in the mind. 
Psychic equivalence, as a mode of experiencing the internal 
world, can cause intense distress, since the projection of fantasy 
to the outside world can be terrifying. The acquisition of a sense 
of pretend in relation to-mental states is therefore essential. The 
repeated experience of affect-regulative mirroring helps the child 
to learn that feelings do not inevitably spill out into the world. 
The child's mental state is decoupled from physical reality. We 
suggest that children whose parents provide more affect-congru­
ent contingent, and appropriately marked, mirroring displays 
facilitate this decoupling. In contrast, the displays of parents 
who, because of their own difficulties with emotion regulation, 
are readily overwhelmed by the infant's negative affect and pro­
duce a realistic unmarked emotion expression disrupt the devel­
opment of affect regulation. A major opportunity for learning

states is lost. We argue that the equation of external and internal 
continues to dominate the subjective world of individuals with 
severe personality disorders. 
Affect-mirroring can take pathological pathways, because the 
caregiver is overwhelmed by the negative affect generated in 
response to the infant's reaction and presents an overly realistic 
emotionally arousing display. This undermines not only the in­
fant's possibility of creating a secondary representation, but also 
the sense of a. boundary between self and other—an internal 
experience suddenly becomes external through the experience 
equivalent to contagion. We believe that this corresponds to the 
clinical characterizations of projective identification, the habit­
ual defense particularly associated with borderline personality 
disorder (BPD). Sustained experience of this kind might, we 
argue, play an important role in establishing projective identifi­
cation as the dominant form of emotional experience in the 
development of borderline personality. It should be noted that we 
use the term "borderline" in this book in the sense of a form of 
pathological personality organization that could be a likely factor 
in all serious personality disorder, rather than just the more 
specific DSM-IV category of personality disorder. Borderline Per­
sonality Disorder. The model advanced in this book is intended 
to explain borderline phenomena in many patients, not just 
those who meet formal diagnostic criteria. Our aim is to cast 
light on the nature of the mental functioning of a larger group of 
patients—perhaps those who fit Otto Kernberg's (1967) classical 
description of borderline personality organization—whose think­
ing and emotional experience often becomes massively disorgan­
ized and regressed in the clinical setting, evoking intense 
feelings in the therapist (e.g., Rey 1979). The emotional lability 
that is a hallmark of these patients.is generally regarded to be a 
clue to the nature of their disturbance. Their therapy rarely 
takes place without dramatic enactments—their own and some­
times their therapists'—and their intense dependence on the 
therapist increases the difficulties ofthe treatment process. 
A second type of deviant mirroring structure is one that we 
feel predisposes to narcissistic personality disorder rather 
than to borderline states. When affect-mirroring is appropriately Introduction / 11 
marked but is noncontingent, in that the infant's emotion is 
misperceived by the caregiver, the baby will still feel the mirrored 
affect display to map onto his primary emotion state. However, 
as this mirrored state is incongruent with the infant's actual 
feelings, the secondary representation created will be distorted. 
The infant will mislabel the primary, constitutional emotional 
state. The self-representation will not have strong ties to the 
underlying emotional state. The individual may convey an im­
pression of reality, but as the constitutional state has not been 
recognized by the caregiver, the self will feel empty because it 
reflects the activation of secondary representations of affect that 
lack the corresponding connections within the constitutional 
self.2 Only when psychotherapy generates mentalized affectivity 
will this fault line in the psychological self be bridged. 
We have attempted to specify In greater detail the psychologi­
cal mechanism that underpins the processes by which parental 
affect-mirroring deviates from its normal course in terms of our 
concept of the alien self. In general we might say that the self as 
agent arises out of the infant's perception of his presumed 
intentionality in the mind of the caregiver. Where parental care-
giving is extremely insensitive and misattuned, we assume that 
a fault is created in the construction of the psychological self. We 
follow Winnicott's (1967) suggestion that the infant, failing to 
find himself in the mother's mind, finds the mother instead. The 
infant is forced to internalize the representation of the object's 
state of mind as a core part of himself. But in such cases 
the internalized other remains alien and unconnected to the 
structures of the constitutional self. In the case of chronically 
insensitive or misattuned caregiving, a fault is created in the 
construction of the self, whereby the infant is forced to internal­
ize the representation ofthe object's state of mind as a core part 
of himself. 
In early development this "alien self is dealt with by ex-
ternalization; as mentalization develops, it can be increasingly

states is lost. We argue that the equation of external and internal 
continues to dominate the subjective world of individuals with 
severe personality disorders. 
Affect-mirroring can take pathological pathways, because the 
caregiver is overwhelmed by the negative affect generated in 
response to the infant's reaction and presents an overly realistic 
emotionally arousing display. This undermines not only the in­
fant's possibility of creating a secondary representation, but also 
the sense of a. boundary between self and other—an internal 
experience suddenly becomes external through the experience 
equivalent to contagion. We believe that this corresponds to the 
clinical characterizations of projective identification, the habit­
ual defense particularly associated with borderline personality 
disorder (BPD). Sustained experience of this kind might, we 
argue, play an important role in establishing projective identifi­
cation as the dominant form of emotional experience in the 
development of borderline personality. It should be noted that we 
use the term "borderline" in this book in the sense of a form of 
pathological personality organization that could be a likely factor 
in all serious personality disorder, rather than just the more 
specific DSM-IV category of personality disorder. Borderline Per­
sonality Disorder. The model advanced in this book is intended 
to explain borderline phenomena in many patients, not just 
those who meet formal diagnostic criteria. Our aim is to cast 
light on the nature of the mental functioning of a larger group of 
patients—perhaps those who fit Otto Kernberg's (1967) classical 
description of borderline personality organization—whose think­
ing and emotional experience often becomes massively disorgan­
ized and regressed in the clinical setting, evoking intense 
feelings in the therapist (e.g., Rey 1979). The emotional lability 
that is a hallmark of these patients.is generally regarded to be a 
clue to the nature of their disturbance. Their therapy rarely 
takes place without dramatic enactments—their own and some­
times their therapists'—and their intense dependence on the 
therapist increases the difficulties ofthe treatment process. 
A second type of deviant mirroring structure is one that we 
feel predisposes to narcissistic personality disorder rather 
than to borderline states. When affect-mirroring is appropriately Introduction / 11 
marked but is noncontingent, in that the infant's emotion is 
misperceived by the caregiver, the baby will still feel the mirrored 
affect display to map onto his primary emotion state. However, 
as this mirrored state is incongruent with the infant's actual 
feelings, the secondary representation created will be distorted. 
The infant will mislabel the primary, constitutional emotional 
state. The self-representation will not have strong ties to the 
underlying emotional state. The individual may convey an im­
pression of reality, but as the constitutional state has not been 
recognized by the caregiver, the self will feel empty because it 
reflects the activation of secondary representations of affect that 
lack the corresponding connections within the constitutional 
self.2 Only when psychotherapy generates mentalized affectivity 
will this fault line in the psychological self be bridged. 
We have attempted to specify In greater detail the psychologi­
cal mechanism that underpins the processes by which parental 
affect-mirroring deviates from its normal course in terms of our 
concept of the alien self. In general we might say that the self as 
agent arises out of the infant's perception of his presumed 
intentionality in the mind of the caregiver. Where parental care-
giving is extremely insensitive and misattuned, we assume that 
a fault is created in the construction of the psychological self. We 
follow Winnicott's (1967) suggestion that the infant, failing to 
find himself in the mother's mind, finds the mother instead. The 
infant is forced to internalize the representation of the object's 
state of mind as a core part of himself. But in such cases 
the internalized other remains alien and unconnected to the

insensitive or misattuned caregiving, a fault is created in the 
construction of the self, whereby the infant is forced to internal­

control and manipulate the parent's behavior. This is part of a 
projective identificatory.process whereby he achieves his need to 
experience his self as coherent, and the alien .part of his self-
structure as outside his mind, by perceiving these elements 
within other selves, normally within a parent. The disorganiza­
tion of the self disorganizes attachment relationships by creating 
a constant need for this projective identification—the externali-
zation ofthe alien self—in any attachment relationship. 
The alien self is present in all of us, because transient neglect 
is part of ordinary caregiving; with the development of mentaliza­
tion, and given a mid-childhood environment relatively free of 
trauma, the gaps in the self corresponding to noncontingent 
parenting are covered over by the self-narratives that the reason­
ably functioning rnind can create. The alien self is mostly perni­
cious when later experiences of trauma in the family or the peer 
group force the child to dissociate from pain by using the alien 
self to identify with the aggressor. In these cases the gaps come 
to be colonized by the image of the aggressor, and the child 
comes to experience himself as destructive and, in the extreme, 
monstrous. Thus we see inadequate early parenting as creating a 
vulnerability that may become destructive of development and 
seriously pathogenic if later experience is unfavorable, either 
in terms of failing to facilitate the later development of mentali­
zation or explicitly calling for the use of the faults in self-
development for defensive purposes. These factors interact, and 
the likelihood of surviving psychological assault improves if 
mentalizing is freely available to interpret the perpetrator's 
behavior (Fonagy, Steele, Steele, Higgitt, and Target 1994). How­
ever, brutalization in the context of attachment relationships 
generates intense shame. This, if coupled with a history of 
neglect and a consequent weakness in mentalization, becomes a 
likely trigger for violence against the self or others, because ofthe 
intensity of the humiliation experienced when the trauma cannot 
be processed and attenuated via mentalization. Unmentalized

the destruction of the self. We have called it "ego-destructive 
shame." The use of the alien, dissociated part of the self to 
contain the image of the aggressor and the unthinkable affect 
generated by their abusive actions is a survival strategy for many 
individuals, some of whom we try to describe in this book. 
The defensive use of the alien part of the self is deeply 
pathogenic, although initially adaptive. In our view it marks the 
development of serious personality problems. It involves three 
important changes: (a) a further repudiation of mentalization, at 
least in attachment contexts, (b) disruption of the psychological 
self by the emergence of a torturing other within the self, and 
(c) vital dependence on the physical presence of the other as a 
vehicle for externalization. These features, in combination, ac­
count for many aspects of disordered functioning in borderline 
patients. Abused and traumatized individuals, unable to con­
ceive of the mental states that could explain the actions of the 
abuser, voluntarily and defensively sacrifice their thinking about 
internal states. While able to think of mental states in self 
and other in the context of ordinary social relationships, they 
inevitably become conflicted and entangled once a relationship 
becomes emotionally intense, organized by mental structures 
that are involved in attachment relationships. The abandonment 
of mentalizing leaves them with an internal reality that is domi­
nated by psychic equivalence. These individuals, like all other 
patients, organize the therapeutic relationship to conform to 
their unconscious expectations, except that for them these ex­
pectations have the full force of reality and there is no sense of 
alternative perspectives. The inability to think about mental 
states removes the possibility of "narrative smoothing" of the 
basic gaps in the self-structure, and the alien self emerges in a 
manner much clearer for the therapist to see and experience. 
Splitting becomes a dominant defense and projective identifica­
tion—the externalization of the alien self—an essential part of 
survival. The vehicles for the projective identification must be 
present for the process of externalization to function, and total

with individuals whose early experiences have led to a compro­
mised mentalizing capacity should be focused on helping them 
to build this interpersonal interpretive capacity. One way of 
conceptualizing the entire psychotherapeutic enterprise may.be 
as an activity that is specifically focused on the rehabilitation of 
this function. The work of many previous theoreticians can be 
reread in the light of our reformulation. Throughout the book we 
often point out that the ideas being advanced here were antici­
pated in the work of great psychoanalytic theoreticians, not least 
those in the object-relations tradition. For example, we make 
many connections with Bion's (1959) thinking about contain­
ment. The interpersonal interpretive stance of the human brain 
is an overarching biological construct (Bogdan 2001): Its limits 
are as yet unexplored. Our concerns in this book are principally 
with reflective function and mentalization—capacities that are 
likely to turn out to be specific instances of this more general 
capacity. 
An important aim of psychotherapy, then, if not its central 
aim, is the extension of mentalization. With some patients, par­
ticularly those at the borderline end of the spectrum, the thera­
pist's task may be considered to be similar to that of the parent 
who intuitively engages with the child's world of psychic equiva­
lence to emphasize its representational character. Integrating 
the concrete and dissociated (pretend) modes of functioning can 
only be achieved.through focused work on the patient's current 
experience of the transference. Some enactments on the part of 
both therapist and patient are an inevitable part of this work, 
since the patient cannot remain psychologically close to the 
therapist without externalizing the alien parts of the self. It is at 
these moments, when the therapist is enacting the split-off part 
of the patient's experience, that the patient's true self may be 
most accurately observed. Sadly, almost invariably the therapist 
will have extreme difficulty in communicating insight and underr 
standing at such times. It is far more likely, in the middle of such 
turmoil, that the therapist's rage or terror or both will obscure 
her vision of the patient. Nevertheless, persistence and a deter­
mined focus on understanding the moment-to^moment changes 
in the patient's experience usually pays off, and the psychothera­
peutic treatment of even quite severely impaired patients can be Introduction / 15 
surprisingly effective (Bateman and Fonagy 1999) and lasting 
(Bateman and Fonagy 2001). 
Not all borderline patients are as severely disturbed as the 
above description implies, although most have features con­
tained in it. If the caregiver has presented affect displays to 
the infant that correspond poorly to the child's constitutional 
self-state, affect regulation will be based on second-order repre­
sentations of affects that do not have strong connections with 
constitutional self-states. Inaccurate mirroring by the caregiver 
will lead to emotional experiences that cannot be experienced as 
"true." Consequently, the secondary representational structures 
will not.provide a means for accessing and attributing emotion 
states to the self. So words will not form the basis for the child's 
emerging ability to think aboui: his or her real thoughts and 
wishes. The aim of psychotherapy for these individuals is to 
regenerate the connection between the consciousness of an af­
fect state and Its experience at the constitutional level. We have 
labeled this "mentalized affectivity"—a term intended to indicate 
the capacity to connect to the meaning of one's emotions. The 
clinical emphasis on experiential understanding of one's feelings 
in a way that ensures "meaningfulness" is crucial because it 
serves to establish congruent connections between primary and 
secondary affect-representational structures. The focus on 
emotion ensures that the secondary representational structures 
used to think about or to reflect on affect are reconnected and 
that misconnections where displayed affect was tied to a differ­
ent nonconscious affect state are corrected. 
This book is divided into three parts. The first part (chapters 
1-3) is theoretical; the second part (chapters 4-8) is developmen­
tal; the third part (chapters 9-11) is clinical. The book concludes 
with an Epilogue. The tripartite division is primarily a matter of 
convenience; it is not meant to convey that the components of 
the content are separate. The reader will find, for example, that 
in the theoretical part there is considerable discussion of devel­
opmental material; that in the developmental part there is impor­
tant theoretical material on. the self as well as the introduction of 
some clinical material. This is deliberate. Throughout this work, 
we attempt to integrate theory, development, and the clinical 
sphere. We are committed to forging a theory that is inspired by

clinical observation and rooted in the findings of systematic 
research. Our aim is to bring both theory and research to bear on 
clinical practice. 
The content of the chapters is as follows: Chapter 1 offers an 
overview of the major themes to be covered in the book. We 
survey the links between attachment theory, studies of early 
social development, and studies of. cognitive development that 
focus on one approach to mentalization—the study ofthe acqui­
sition of a "theory of mind." We sketch an outline (to be filled in 
later) of what we know about the developmental course of self-
organization and the developmental deviations that can result 
from an adverse early environment, later trauma, or both. We 
introduce the notion of mentalization as a potential mediator of 
psychosocial risk. 
In chapter 2, we consider broad intellectual trends in theories 
of affect, across a range of disciplines. We suggest that the 
dialectic between those who see affect as inevitably disorganizing 
and external to cognitive influence and those who attempt to 
integrate affect as a form of cognitive activity may be addressed 
through the concept of mentalization and—more narrowly— 
mentalized affectivity. We introduce a distinction between first-
and second-order representation of affect and argue that this 
distinction is consistent with data from psychology, neurophysi­
ology, and psychoanalytic theories. 
In chapter 3, we address the challenge posed by recent argu­
ments about the relative importance of genes and the early 
environment to a mainly psychosocial model of personality de­
velopment. It may seem foolhardy to advance a model in which 
the capacity for mentalization is rooted in an attachment rela­
tionship, at a time when social cognitive capacities are increas­
ingly seen as being genetically determined rather than as 
products of the early environment. We counter this challenge by 
arguing that the human capacity for interpreting the social 
environment is a key moderating influence in the expression of 
genes in phenotypes. Mentalization and the, family-of capacities 
to which it belongs (deriving from the "interpersonal interpretive 
mechanism") can be either facilitated or retarded by attachment 
experiences and can play a key role in creating an experienced 
environment. As part of this argument, we propose a reorienta-Introduction / 17 
tion of attachment theory, from an emphasis on templates for 
relationships, fixed in early infancy, to a model that views at­
tachment as the context provided by evolution for the develop­
ment of interpersonal understanding. 
Chapter 4 presents in detail our developmental model of how 
an interpersonal interpretive mechanism for affect might evolve 
intersubjectively, in the context ofthe infant-caregiver relation­
ship. This is a parsimonious model. Traditionally, psychoana­
lytic developmental models have made extravagant assumptions 
about infants' capacities. This was one of the major foci of 
the Controversial Discussions between Anna Freud and Melanie 
Klein (King and Steiner 1991). In contrast, our more parsimoni­
ous model is based on Gergely and Watson's (1996) Social Bio­
feedback Theory, which is, in turn, rooted in Watson's work on 
the developmental functions of the human infant's sensitivity to 
contingent relationships between his proprioception (of inten­
tional movement) and the external world. We argue that the 
internal representation of affect develops around the mother's 
mirroring of the infant's expressions of affect. The caregiver's 
mirroring display is internalized and comes to represent an 
internal state, but it can do so only in certain conditions, which 
include sufficient attunement, together with signaling to the 
infant that the affect the caregiver is expressing is not her own 
but the child's. This account will help us to understand a range 
of severe pathologies. 
In chapter 5, we review developmental research concerning 
the development of the self as agent rather than as representa­
tion. We consider a five-phase model of gradually Increasing 
sophistication concerning the mental world, both of the self and 
of others. In this chapter we confront the critical issue of inter-
subjectivity, a fraught notion within developmental theory. We 
argue that interpersonal awareness is a relatively late develop­
mental acquisition. Assuming a developmental progression to­
ward full interpersonal awareness offers us a rich range of 
developmental explanations for psychological disturbances. In 
general, we maintain throughout this volume that personality 
disturbances often reflect the reemergence of rudimentary forms 
of interpersonal awareness—an argument that is incompatible 
with the assumption of an inherent (primary) intersubjectivity.

lytic developmental models have made extravagant assumptions 
about infants' capacities. This was one of the major foci of 
the Controversial Discussions between Anna Freud and Melanie 
Klein (King and Steiner 1991). In contrast, our more parsimoni­
ous model is based on Gergely and Watson's (1996) Social Bio­
feedback Theory, which is, in turn, rooted in Watson's work on 
the developmental functions of the human infant's sensitivity to 
contingent relationships between his proprioception (of inten­
tional movement) and the external world. We argue that the 
internal representation of affect develops around the mother's 
mirroring of the infant's expressions of affect. The caregiver's 
mirroring display is internalized and comes to represent an 
internal state, but it can do so only in certain conditions, which 
include sufficient attunement, together with signaling to the 
infant that the affect the caregiver is expressing is not her own 
but the child's. This account will help us to understand a range 
of severe pathologies. 
In chapter 5, we review developmental research concerning 
the development of the self as agent rather than as representa­
tion. We consider a five-phase model of gradually Increasing 
sophistication concerning the mental world, both of the self and 
of others. In this chapter we confront the critical issue of inter-
subjectivity, a fraught notion within developmental theory. We 
argue that interpersonal awareness is a relatively late develop­
mental acquisition. Assuming a developmental progression to­
ward full interpersonal awareness offers us a rich range of 
developmental explanations for psychological disturbances. In 
general, we maintain throughout this volume that personality 
disturbances often reflect the reemergence of rudimentary forms 
of interpersonal awareness—an argument that is incompatible 
with the assumption of an inherent (primary) intersubjectivity. 

18 / Introduction 
In chapter 6, we attempt to apply the findings from early 
developmental research more directly to construct a psychoana­
lytic model ofthe growth of subjectivity. Using clinical as well as 
empirical evidence, we identify two incompatible and probably 
alternating ways in which young children treat their inner expe­
riences. The mental world can feel either totally real or totally 
unreal to a young child, and we suggest that playing with reality, 
making the real unreal and vice versa, is the principal avenue for 
the development of mentalization. We introduce the cases of two 
young children, both treated in psychoanalytic therapy. "Re­
becca" was the loved child of young single mother, a child who 
learned in therapy to play with her painful image of her father. 
This idea had initially been too real to be played with, and the 
feelings it generated obstructed her otherwise normal develop­
ment. 
In chapter 7, we introduce "Mat," a far more deprived child. 
Mat's experience of inadequate mirroring left him with uncon-
tained and uncontainable affect, which he experienced as part of 
his bodily self, in an effort to create an illusion of self-control. His 
encopresis and his quasi-autistic features both responded to a 
playful therapeutic stance.. 
In chapter 8, we consider the special case of adolescence, a 
time of high risk for the emergence of serious disturbance. We 
argue that this is the consequence of an increased load on the 
mental world ofthe adolescent, brought on by the sudden leap in 
cognitive complexity, simultaneously with pressure for sepa­
ration from the primary attachment figures. We consider two 
cases, 'Tony" and "Glen." Both were challenged by the sharply 
increased complexity of their interpersonal worlds, but once 
again they followed quite different paths. We maintain that this 
reflected: critical differences in their early experience, which 
equipped one with a far more robust mentalizing capacity than 
the other. 
In the two following chapters, we discuss severe personality 
disorder in adults, which we see as the developmental continua­
tion of poorly established mentalized subjectivity. 
In chapter 9, we outline the theory that borderline personality 
disorder results from the inhibition of mentalizing due to mal­
treatment in childhood. We expect that this kind of inhibition is Introduction / 19 
more likely to occur if, because of inadequate early parenting, 
the precursors of mentalization were not firmly established. 
Interpersonal interpretive processes that developmentally ante­
date mentalization appear to govern the behavior of individuals 
with BPD, at least within attachment relationships. In chapter 
10, we link the failure of mentalization to a distortion in the 
structuring of the self; failures of early attunement are expected 
to cause disorganization within the structure of the self-repre­
sentation. Combined with trauma, these limitations in the integ­
rity of the self can cause massive disruption in relationships. 
Two cases are presented. In the first case, "Emma," lack of 
mentalization was evident in her treatment of her own body—her 
suicidality and mismanagement of her chronic physical illness. 
The disorganization of her self-structure, when externalized onto 
her body, led to a profound distortion of the link to her physical 
experiences. The second case, "Henrietta," had a history of vio­
lence against a lover, as well as self-destructiveness. Her func­
tioning at a prementalistic level profoundly colored her analytic 
relationship. In this chapter we also consider the implications of 
a disorganized self-structure, with very limited capacity for men­
talization, for our understanding of certain transference and 
countertransference phenomena. 
Finally, in chapter 11, we consider four more therapeutic 
encounters. Each illustrates in a different way the centrality of 
mentalized affectivity in the course of psychoanalytic therapy. 
The aim of this chapter is to illustrate the way misconnections 
between primary and second-order representation of affect can 
generate disturbances of self-development, which were earlier 
argued to be the consequences of inaccurate mirroring. To ad­
dress such pathologies, the therapy must simultaneously acti­
vate primary and secondary representations of affect. The cases 
illustrate the importance of the integration of affect and cogni­
tion in the practice of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Through 
developing second-order representations for emotional states we 
can come to experience our subjectivity in a way that bridges two 
fundamental needs in human beings. On the one hand, we need 
to maintain a sense of the internal equilibrium between mental 
forces—a struggle that was at the heart of Freud's journey of 
discovery. On the other, we need to be integrated into the social

THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES 
In Part I, we offer an introduction to some of the main theoretical 
concepts used in this book. The first chapter can be thought of as 
an overture. We offer definitions of self-reflective function and 
mentalization and, in particular, make the argument that the 
capacity to mentalize is a key determinant of a psychological 
sense of self. Yet, mentalization is not simply a cognitive concept, 
and thus we turn in the second chapter to focus in detail on 
different perspectives on affects and affect regulation. We clarify 
the meaning of affect regulation and emphasize the distinction 
between a basic form of affect regulation where the object is 
needed to modulate an affect or affects and a more complex form, 
altered by the development of mentalization, where the aim is to 
be able to regulate the self. Finally, in the third chapter, we stake 
out a defense of an environmental position concerning early 
development, which does not contest the evidence for a genetic-
btological position but does challenge some ofthe inferences that 
are made from it—especially as they are mistranslated into the 
clinical realm. We also propose here a crucial reformulation of 
attachment theory: according to our view, a major goal of 
attachment is to produce a representational systemfor self-states 
through mentalization.

Attachment and Reflective Function: 
Their Role in Self-Organization 
This chapter introduces the idea of a relationship between at­
tachment processes and the development of the capacity to 
envision mental states in self and others—the capacity that is 
referred to in this book as mentalization or reflective function. 
Throughout this book, we develop the argument that the capac­
ity to mentalize is a key determinant of self-organization and 
affect regulation, and we maintain that this capacity is acquired 
in the context of the child's early social relationships. Here we 
give an overview of the evidence for an association between the 
quality of attachment relationship and reflective function in the 
parent and the child. We offer some hypotheses about the devel­
opment of reflection in the context of the infant-caregiver rela­
tionship. We then interpret these data and speculations in the 
context of current models of theory-of-mind development. 
REFLECTIVE FUNCTION OR MENTALIZATION: 
A HISTORICAL CONTEXT 
Concepts and ideas around the notion of affect and self abound 
and have an extraordinarily rich history in philosophy and psy­
chology. Even without a comprehensive historical perspective, it 
23 

24 / Theoretical Perspectives 
seems apparent that the concept of the self and allied ideas 
have, more recently, been experiencing a considerable revival 
of interest from social scientists and developmentalists (e.g., 
Bracken 1996; Cicchetti and Toth 1994). Psychological interest 
in the self is usually traced to W. James's (1890, 1892) distinc­
tion of two aspects of the self: the "I" (self as subject) and the 
"Me" (self as object). The "I" is the active agent responsible for 
constructing the self-concept of "Me." To paraphrase in the 
terms of current cognitive neuroscience, the "Me" is the mental 
representation, while the "I" embodies the self as agent, the 
mental processes or functions that underpin representations of 
the self (Mandler 1985). The "I" organizes and interprets experi­
ence, ensures the experience of continuity through time, creates 
a sense of freedom or initiative, and generates the experiences 
leading to the distinctness of oneself as a person (see chapter 5). 
Modern developmental psychology has brought us closer to a full 
understanding of the mental processes that combine to organize 
the representation of selfhood. 
Developmentalists over the past ten years have drawn our 
attention to the near-universal and remarkable capacity of 
young children to interpret their own and others' behavior by 
attributing mental states (see chapters 3 and 4). Reflective 
function, referred to in developmental psychology as "theory of 
mind," is the developmental acquisition that permits children to 
respond not only to another person's behavior, but to the chil­
dren's conception of others' beliefs, feelings, attitudes, desires, 
hopes, knowledge, imagination, pretense, deceit, intentions, 
plans, and so on. Reflective function, or mentalization, enables 
children to "read" other people's minds (Baron-Cohen 1995; 
Baron-Cohen, Tager-Flusberg, and Cohen 1993; Morton and 
Frith 1995). By doing this, children make people's behavior 
meaningful and predictable. Their early experiences with other 
people enable them to build up and organize multiple sets of 
self-other representations. As they learn to understand other 
people's behavior better, they become able flexibly to activate the 
representation(s) from these multiple sets that are best suited to 
respond to particular interpersonal transactions. The term "re­
flective function" (RF) refers to the operationalization of the 
psychological processes underlying the capacity to mentalize—a Attachment and Reflective Function / 25 
concept that has been described in both the psychoanalytic 
(Fonagy 1989; Fonagy, Edgcumbe, Moran, Kennedy, and Target 
1993) and cognitive (e.g., Morton and Frith 1995) psychology 
literatures. Reflective functioning or mentalization is the active 
expression of this psychological capacity intimately related to 
the representation of the self (Fonagy and Target 1995, 1996; 
Target and Fonagy 1996). RF involves both a self-reflective and 
an interpersonal component that ideally provides the individual 
with a well-developed capacity to distinguish inner from outer 
reality, pretend from "real" modes of functioning, and intra-
personal mental and emotional processes from interpersonal 
communications. 
The interdependence of understanding applied to others and 
to the self was highlighted by the second pioneer of psychological 
self theory, Cooley (1912): "The thing that moves us to pride and 
shame is not the mechanical reflection of ourselves, but an 
imputed sentiment, the imagined effect of this reflection upon 
another's mind" (p. 153). Developmentally, this may be thought 
to imply that a mental operation is required in early childhood 
to derive the self-state from the apperception ofthe mental state 
of the other. Exploring the meaning of others' actions is then a 
precursor of children's ability to label and find meaningful their 
own psychological experiences. This ability arguably underlies 
the capacities for affect regulation, impulse control, self-moni­
toring, and the experience of self-agency—the building blocks of 
the organization of the self. This book attempts to trace the 
stages of acquisition of reflective function or mentalization, its 
roots in attachment, the relationship with the development of 
self-organization, and the particular role of emotional experi­
ence. This is highlighted in the final chapter, on mentalized 
affectivity. 
The notion of reflective function is rooted in Dennett's (1978, 
1987, 1988) proposal that three stances are available in the 
prediction of behavior: the physical stance, the design stance, 
and the intentional stance. He takes predicting the behavior of a 
chess-playing computer as his example. At its simplest this can 
be based on knowledge of the physical properties of the machine 
(the physical stance). The design stance would be based on 
knowledge ofthe design ofthe computer, including the program-

ming that had gone into its development. The third approach 
consists of predicting what might be the computer's most ra­
tional move. Here we attribute to the computer certain beliefs 
and desires—in other words, regulation by intentional; states. 
Dennett's thesis is that explanation in terms of such states of 
meaning provides good grounds for predicting human behavior— 
the only grounds accessible to all of us—this knowledge is em­
bodied in the theory of mind of folk psychology (Churchland 
1986; Fodor 1987; Mele 1992).l 
Theory of mind" is an interconnected set of beliefs and de­
sires, attributed to explain a person's behavior. The theory-of-
mind concept has great explanatory value. Philosophers of mind 
(Hopkins 1992; Wollheim 1995) have extended Dennett's ap­
proach to examine unconscious processes. They illustrated that 
one of Freud's substantive contributions was to extend folk 
psychology to unconscious mental states, a theory of uncon­
scious mind, thus making those aspects of behavior meaningful 
that—using the ordinary constructs of intentionality—make 
little sense (e.g., dreams, neurotic symptoms, humor). These 
behaviors may be understood if we add unconscious beliefs, 
thoughts, feelings, and desires to our everyday model of the 
mind. 
For research purposes, we have operationalized mentalization 
as reflective function (Fonagy et al. 1998): we have developed a 
tool by means of which the ability to give plausible interpretation 
of one's own and others' behavior in terms of underlying mental 
states can be measured. This implies awareness that experi­
ences give rise to certain beliefs and emotions, that particular 
beliefs and desires tend to result in certain kinds of behavior, 
that there are transactional relationships between beliefs and 
emotions, and that particular developmental phases or relation­
ships are associated with certain feelings and beliefs. We do not 
expect an individual to articulate this theoretically, but to dem­
onstrate it in the way they interpret events within attachment 
relationships when asked to do so. Individuals differ in the

extent to which they are able to go beyond observable phenom­
ena to give an account of their own or others' actions in terms of 
beliefs, desires, plans, and so on. This cognitive capacity is an 
important determinant of individual differences in self-organiza­
tion as it is intimately involved with many defining features of 
selfhood such as self::consciousness, autonomy, freedom, and 
responsibility (Bolton and Hill 1996; Cassam 1994). Intentional 
stance, in the broad sense considered here (i.e., including appar­
ently irrational unconscious acts), creates the continuity of self-
experience that is the underpinning of a coherent self-structure. 
It is important not to conflate reflective function with intro­
spection. Bolton and Hill (1996) note that the weakness of in­
trospection is to define mental states in terms of consciousness 
or self-report rather than, as here, in terms of their capacity to 
make sense of, and thus regulate, behavior. Introspection or self-
reflection is quite different from reflective function as the latter is 
an automatic procedure, unconsciously invoked in interpreting 
human- action. We see introspection as an overlearned skill, 
which may be systematically misleading in a way that is much 
more difficult to detect and correct than mistakes in conscious 
attributions would be. The shape and coherence lent to self-
organization by reflective function is entirely outside awareness, 
in contrast to introspection, which has a clear impact on ex­
perience of oneself. Knowledge of minds in general, rather than 
self-knowledge, is,the defining feature; introspection is the appli­
cation ofthe theory of mind to one's own mental states. 
The Psychoanalytic Concept of Reflective Function 
Various notions have been introduced in the psychoanalytic 
literature to denote mental processes that overlap with the con­
struct of mentalization, underpinned by RF. Space does not 
permit an exhaustive review, but some of these should be men­
tioned, as they may assist the reader in making links between 
the current constructs and those proposed by other writers. 
Mentalization has been described in the psychoanalytic litera­
ture under various headings (see the excellent review by 
Lecours and Bouchard 1997). All such notions derive from

ming that had gone into its development. The third approach

ena to give an account of their own or others' actions in terms of 
beliefs, desires, plans, and so on. This cognitive capacity is an 
important determinant of individual differences in self-organiza­
tion as it is intimately involved with many defining features of 
selfhood such as self::consciousness, autonomy, freedom, and 
responsibility (Bolton and Hill 1996; Cassam 1994). Intentional 
stance, in the broad sense considered here (i.e., including appar­
ently irrational unconscious acts), creates the continuity of self-
experience that is the underpinning of a coherent self-structure. 
It is important not to conflate reflective function with intro­
spection. Bolton and Hill (1996) note that the weakness of in­
trospection is to define mental states in terms of consciousness 
or self-report rather than, as here, in terms of their capacity to 
make sense of, and thus regulate, behavior. Introspection or self-
reflection is quite different from reflective function as the latter is 
an automatic procedure, unconsciously invoked in interpreting 
human- action. We see introspection as an overlearned skill, 
which may be systematically misleading in a way that is much 
more difficult to detect and correct than mistakes in conscious 
attributions would be. The shape and coherence lent to self-
organization by reflective function is entirely outside awareness, 
in contrast to introspection, which has a clear impact on ex­
perience of oneself. Knowledge of minds in general, rather than 
self-knowledge, is,the defining feature; introspection is the appli­
cation ofthe theory of mind to one's own mental states. 
The Psychoanalytic Concept of Reflective Function 
Various notions have been introduced in the psychoanalytic 
literature to denote mental processes that overlap with the con­
struct of mentalization, underpinned by RF. Space does not 
permit an exhaustive review, but some of these should be men­
tioned, as they may assist the reader in making links between 
the current constructs and those proposed by other writers. 
Mentalization has been described in the psychoanalytic litera­
ture under various headings (see the excellent review by 
Lecours and Bouchard 1997). All such notions derive from 

28 / Theoretical Perspectives 
Freud's initial concept of "Bindung" or linking. In his distinc­
tion between primary and secondary processes, Freud (1911b) 
stressed both that "Bindung" was a qualitative change from a 
physical (immediate) to a psychic associative quality of linking 
and that the psychic working out or representing of internal 
state of affairs (conceived of in energic terms) failed in various 
ways (Freud 1914c). Some might argue that Melanie Klein's 
notion of the depressive position (Klein 1945) is at least analo­
gous to the notion of the acquisition of RF, which necessarily 
entails the recognition of hurt and suffering in the other as well 
as that of one's own role in the process. Wilfred Bion (1962a, 
1962b), in describing the "alpha-function," delineated the trans­
formation of internal events experienced as concrete ("beta-ele­
ments") into tolerable thinkable experiences. Similarly to the 
current conception, Bion also saw the mother-child relationship 
as at the root of the symbolic capacity. Winnicott (1962) also 
recognized the importance of the caregiver's psychological un­
derstanding of the infant for the emergence of the true self. 
Winnicott was also foremost among psychoanalytic theorists of 
self-development (e.g., Fairbairn 1952; Kohut 1977) in recogniz­
ing that the psychological self develops through the perception 
of oneself in another person's mind as thinking and feeling. 
Parents who cannot reflect with understanding on their chil­
dren's inner experiences and respond accordingly deprive their 
children of a core psychological structure, which they need to 
build a viable sense of self. 
Independently, French psychoanalysts developed a notion of 
mentalization that was largely formulated from the economic 
point of view. Pierre Marty discussed mentalization as a protecr 
rive buffer in the preconscious system that prevents progressive 
disorganization (Marty 1968). He considers mentalization as 
connecting drive excitations and mental representations and 
thereby creating both "fluidity" and "constancy" (Marty 1990, 
1991). Mentalization ensures freedom in the use of associations 
as well as permanence and stability. At the same time Pierre 
Luquet (1981, 1988) discussed the development of different 
forms of thinking and the reorganization of inner experience 
alongside this development. In his chapter on a theory of lan­
guage (Luquet 1987), he distinguished primary mentalization Attachment and Reflective Function / 29 
(which we would consider the absence of RF) from secondary 
symbolic mentalization. While this form of mentalization was still 
seen as closely connected to sensory data and primary uncon­
scious fantasies, it was nevertheless also seen as representative 
of these processes and observable in dreams, art, and play. His 
third level was verbal thought, which he considered most distant 
from bodily processes. Similar ideas were proposed by Andre 
Green (1975), Hanna Segal (1957), and Joyce McDougall (1978); 
and, more recently, by Auerbach (1993; Auerbach and Blatt 
1996), Busch (1995), and Frosch (1995). 
Theories Concerning the Development of Mentalization 
Baron-Cohen and Swettenham appropriately ask: "how on earth 
can young children master such abstract concepts as belief (and 
false belief) with such ease, and roughly at the same time the 
world over" (1996, p. 158)? Their answer is that of modularity 
theorists, along the lines of Chomsky's solution to the problem of 
the acquisition of a knowledge of syntax. They postulate an 
innate (learning) mechanism with a specific location in the brain 
(see also Baron-Cohen 1995; Leslie 1994; G. Segal 1996). Other 
current psychological theories stress the cognitive precursors of 
theory of mind. Some favor the folk-psychology, theory-theory, 
approach, which assumes that the child evolves a scientific-
theory-like network of interdependent propositions about the 
mind on -the basis of experience (e.g., Botterill 1996; Gopnik 
1996). Others assume that theory of mind is acquired via simula­
tion of the mental state of the other, either through making 
inferences from what we ourselves would do in the imagined 
circumstances (e.g., Goldman 1993; P. L. Harris 1992) or an 
even more radical assumption of imagined transformation 
into the other which does not involve introspection or inference 
(Gordon 1992, 1995). These, and other theories, are considered 
in greater detail in chapter 5. 
Both simulation and theory-theory models may at first glance 
appear to emphasize social-learning aspects of the development 
of mind-reading, but on closer scrutiny their focus is at the level 
of mechanism rather than content. They question how and when

the child acquires knowledge of other minds in an abstract sense 
and do not ask what the child feels about the mental states he 
encounters in others. Yet, in this context at least, the question of 
knowledge and that of emotional investment are evidently closely 
related. The child may know what the other feels but care little 
or not at all about this; alternatively, this information may, for 
some youngsters, be an issue of survival. The emotional signifi­
cance of mental states determines the evolution of the capacity 
or structure available for processing, but this is not usually 
addressed. Current models of theory-of-mind development tend 
to portray the child as an isolated processor of information, who 
constructs a theory of mind using biological mechanisms that 
have an expectable failure rate where the child's endowment is 
less than optimal. 
From the viewpoint of developmental psychopathology and its 
psychosocial treatment, this is a barren picture, which ignores 
the central role of the child's emotional relationship with the 
parents in fostering the capacity to understand interactions in 
psychological terms. The development of children's understand­
ing of mental states is embedded within the social world of the 
family, with its network of complex and often intensely emotion­
ally charged relationships, which are, after all, much of what 
early reflection needs to comprehend. Therefore it should not 
surprise us that the nature of family interactions, the quality of 
parental control (Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Telsa, and Young-
blade 1991), parental talk about emotions (Denham, Zoller, and 
Couchoud 1994), and the depth of parental discussion involving 
affect (Dunn, Brown, and Beardsall 1991) are all strongly associ­
ated with the acquisition of the intentional stance in obser­
vational studies. The involvement of the family in the child's 
acquisition of a theory of mind is further highlighted- by the 
robust finding that the presence of older siblings in the family 
appears to improve the child's performance on a range of false-
belief tasks (Jenkins and Astington 1996; Perner, Ruffman, and 
Leekam 1994; Ruffman, Perner, Naito, Parkin, and Clements 
1998). 
Modular accounts of theory-of-mind development have diffi­
culty with such data. Neither the theory-theory nor the simula­
tion account adequately covers the social origins of this critical Attachment and Reflective Function / 31 
aspect of self-organization. In the theory-theory account, mental 
concepts are thought to develop within a network of interde­
pendent concepts on the basis of data from the social world, but 
the socialworld does not generally "give" concepts to the child; 
rather, it provides him with data for concept-building. In the 
simulation model, mental-state concepts are thought to arise 
from introspection, but this begs the question of how children 
come to think of their own mental states as feelings, beliefs, 
wishes, and so on. This chapter and the book as a whole explore 
the role of parent-child relationships in the transformation of 
prereflective experience of mental states into reflective under­
standing of them. Both social models of mind-reading may have 
their place here; the predominance of one or other route to 
understanding the mind may be a function of individual differ­
ences between children, but, in our view, a satisfactory model 
must be rooted in the child's relationships with attachment 
figures. 
THE DEVELOPMENTAL ROOTS 
OF REFLECTIVE FUNCTION IN INFANCY 
The "Teleological" Stance 
There is general agreement that self-organization initially entails 
the integration of body-related experiences, defining the physical 
boundaries of self and world (e.g., Brownell and Kopp 1991). 
Once the physical self has been established, social exchanges, 
the identifications of social boundaries, and, somewhat later, 
the identification of social causality become central self-func­
tions. The parent's recognition of the child's intentional stance 
(Dennett 1978), however, is communicated nonverbally, begin­
ning at birth. Between birth and the age of 5 months, face-to-
face exchanges of affective signals between infant and caregiver 
(Beebe, Lachmarm, and Jaffe 1997; Tronick 1989) play a key role 
in the development of the child's representation of affect.

demonstrate that infants express surprise when nonhuman but 
moving objects (e.g., various-sized disks in a computer-gener­

the optimal action, given specific goals and reality constraints. 
The infant is assumed to extend teleological models beyond 
the prediction of human behavior. Teleological models, however, 
evolve into mentalizing ones in the restricted domain of human 
action. They become fully mentalizing once representations of 
future goal states come to be thought of as desires and con­
straints on reality come to be thought of in terms of the agent's 
belief about physical reality. The infant's behaviors in dyadic 
interactions are underpinned by their evolving model of rational 
action on the part of the caregiver. We argue that the develop­
ment from teleological to mentalizing models will depend on the 
quality of interpersonal interactions between the infant and the 
parent. It should be noted that while such models may merely 
represent rational action, it is the perceived rather than actual 
rationality of an act that defines the teleological model. Thus, 
misapprehension of reality constraints (e.g., assumed danger-

clearly irrational from an external standpoint is nevertheless 
seen as based on the principle of rational action. The predictive

characteristic ways, they may index processes that are crucial to 
the creation of a secure mother-infant bond. 
Representational Mapping 
Representational mapping is likely to underpin the gradual move 
in infancy from teleological to mentalizing models of mind. Be­
tween the ages of 6 and 18 months, the child becomes increas­
ingly able to match his mental state with that of the caregiver 
vis-a-vis a third object or person, as, for example, in requesting 
joint attention (Bretherton 1991a). The communication is evi­
dently deliberate (goal-oriented) since children may be observed 
at this phase trying to repair failed communicative bids (Golin-
koff 1986) and thus showing at least rudimentary recognition of 
awareness and agency in self and other, including feelings, 
perceptions, and intentions (Wellman 1993). Neisser (1991) sug­
gested that, based on perceptual processes, two preconceptual 
aspects of the self emerge: the ecological and the interpersonal. 
While the former involves self-awareness in reference to visuo-
spatial, tactile, auditory, and other perceptual information 
concerning the child's nonsocial surroundings, the latter is gen­
erated via the coperception of actions of the self and related 
contingent actions of others. Taking Stern's (1985) and Neisser's 
formulation of the interpersonal self together, we can identify 
three aspects of the intersubjective development of the 
self, which Mundy and Hogan (1994) term "instrumental action 
states," "sensory or perceptual action states," and "affective ac­
tion states." Rogers and Pennington (1991) offered a model ofthe 
cognitive basis for such an intersubjective process in.their con­
cept of representational mapping (the process of coordinating 
representations of self and other), which is thought to underlie 
the sharing of affect, attention, and higher-order aspects of 
cognition such as beliefs. The existence of imitation skills from 
the neonatal stage represents strong evidence for the model 
(Meltzoff and Gopnik 1993). The acquisition of an appreciation of 
mental states, however, goes beyond mirroring. 
The development of an understanding of affect in self and 
other may be a good illustration of the role of representational 
at Attachment and Reflective Function / 35 
mapping in the development of reflective abilities (Gergely and 
Watson 1996; Target and Fonagy 1996). Anxiety, for example, is 
for the .infant a "confusing mixture of physiological changes, 
ideas, and behaviors. When the mother reflects, or mirrors, the 
child's anxiety, this perception organizes the child's experience, 
and he now "knows" what he is feeling. The mother's representa­
tion of the infant's affect is represented by the child and is 
mapped onto the representation of its self-state. The discrepancy 
between these is helpful insofar as it provides organization for 
the self-state, and thus the caregiver's mirroring can become the 
higher-order representation ofthe child's experience. Within this 
model, mirroring would be expected to fail if it is either too close 
to the infant's experience or too remote from it. If the mirroring is 
too accurate, the perception itself can become a source of fear, 
and it loses its symbolic potential. If it is absent, not readily 
forthcoming, or contaminated with the mother's own preoccupa­
tion, the process of self-development is profoundly compromised. 
We may presume that individuals for whom the symptoms of 
anxiety signify catastrophes (e.g., heart attack, imminent death, 
etc.) have metarepresentations of their emotional responses 
which cannot limit their intensity through symbolization, per­
haps because the original mirroring by the primary caregiver 
exaggerated the infant's emotions. 
Although this idea is speculative, it is empirically testable. It 
might help to answer the thorny question of why individuals 
with panic disorders are so threatened by physiologically rela­
tively mild disturbances of their equilibrium. The suggestion 
here is that the metarepresentation, or symbolic representation, 
of affect in these cases contains too much of the primary experi­
ence; hence, instead of labeling the experience in such a way as 
to enable the individual to attenuate its intensity, it tends to 
stimulate and exacerbate symptoms of the affect state, which in 
turn accentuates the secondary expression, in a cycle of escalat­
ing panic.3 In one study (Fonagy, Steele, et al. 1995), we have 
confirmed that mothers who soothe their distressed 8-month-
olds most effectively following an injection rapidly reflect the

characteristic ways, they may index processes that are crucial to 
the creation of a secure mother-infant bond. 
Representational Mapping 
Representational mapping is likely to underpin the gradual move 
in infancy from teleological to mentalizing models of mind. Be­
tween the ages of 6 and 18 months, the child becomes increas­
ingly able to match his mental state with that of the caregiver 
vis-a-vis a third object or person, as, for example, in requesting 
joint attention (Bretherton 1991a). The communication is evi­
dently deliberate (goal-oriented) since children may be observed 
at this phase trying to repair failed communicative bids (Golin-
koff 1986) and thus showing at least rudimentary recognition of 
awareness and agency in self and other, including feelings, 
perceptions, and intentions (Wellman 1993). Neisser (1991) sug­
gested that, based on perceptual processes, two preconceptual 
aspects of the self emerge: the ecological and the interpersonal. 
While the former involves self-awareness in reference to visuo-
spatial, tactile, auditory, and other perceptual information 
concerning the child's nonsocial surroundings, the latter is gen­
erated via the coperception of actions of the self and related 
contingent actions of others. Taking Stern's (1985) and Neisser's 
formulation of the interpersonal self together, we can identify 
three aspects of the intersubjective development of the 
self, which Mundy and Hogan (1994) term "instrumental action 
states," "sensory or perceptual action states," and "affective ac­

child's emotion, but this mirroring is contaminated by displays 
of affect that are incompatible with the child's current feeling 
(smiling, questioning, mocking display, and the like). In display­
ing such "complex, affect" (Fonagy and Fonagy 1987), they en­
sure that the infant recognizes their emotion as analogous, but 
not identical, to their experience, and thus the process of symbol 
formation may begin. In this way, the representational mapping 
between affect of self and emotions of others, the exchange of 
affect between young child and caregiver, provides a unique 
source of information to the child about his own internal states. 
We suggest that the meaning or sense of affect develops out of 
the integrated representation of the affect in self and other. 
The combination of the representation of self-experience and 
the representation of the reaction of the caregiver elaborates the 
child's teleological model of the mind and ultimately enables him 
to understand affective displays in others, as well.as arriving at

ping of emotion displays and self-experience is seen here as a 
prototypical instance of caregiver sensitivity, which, as we at­
tempt to demonstrate, is likely to be an important component of 
the development of mentalizing. The sensitivity of the caregiver 
prompts the child to begin organizing self-experience according 
to clusters of responses that will eventually come to be verbally 
labeled as specific emotions (or desires). The high contingent 
response is the means by which this mapping can take place. 
The child's affective experiences are given further meaning by 
becoming associated with clusters of reality constraints with­
in the parent-infant interaction (leading to rudimentary beliefs 
about the causes and consequences of his emotional state). 
REFLECTIVE FUNCTION 
AND ATTACHMENT SECURITY IN THE PARENT 
Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby (1969, 1973, 
1980), postulates a universal human need to form close 
affectional bonds. At its core is the reciprocity of early relation­
ships, which is a precondition of normal development probably Attachment and Reflective Function / 37 
In all mammals, including humans (Hofer 1995). The attach­
ment behaviors of the human infant (e.g., proximity-seek­
ing, smiling, clinging) are reciprocated by adult attachment 
behaviors (touching, holding, soothing), and these responses 
strengthen the attachment behavior of the infant toward that 
particular adult. The activation of attachment behaviors de­
pends on the infant's evaluation of a range of environmental 
signals, which results in the feeling of security or insecurity. The 
experience of security is the goal of the attachment system, 
which is thus first and foremost a regulator of emotional expe­
rience (Sroufe 1996). In this sense it lies at the heart of many 
forms of mental disorder and the entire psychotherapeutic 
enterprise. 
None of us is born with the capacity to regulate our own 
emotional reactions. A dyadic regulatory system evolves where 
the infant's signals of moment-to-moment changes in his state 
are understood and responded to by the caregiver, thereby 
achieving their regulation. The infant learns that arousal in the 
presence of the caregiver will not lead to disorganization beyond 
his coping capabilities. The caregiver will be there to reestablish 
equilibrium. In states of uncontrollable arousal, the infant will 
come to seek physical proximity to the caregiver in the hope of 
soothing and the recovery of homeostasis. The infant's behavior 
by the end of the first year is purposeful and apparently based 
on specific expectations. His past experiences with the caregiver 
are aggregated into representational systems that Bowlby (1973) 
termed "internal working models" (IWM). Thus, the attachment 
system is an open biosocial homeostatic regulatory system.

from their caregiver in a situation unfamiliar to them, show one 
of four patterns of behavior: (a) Infants classified as secure

explore readily in the presence of the primary caregiver, are 
anxious in the presence of the stranger and avoid her, are 
distressed by their caregiver's brief absence, rapidly seek contact 
with her afterwards, and are reassured by this contact, return­
ing to their exploration, (b) Some infants, who appear to be made 
less anxious by separation, may not seek proximity with -the 
caregiver following separation and may not prefer her over the 
stranger; these infants are designated anxious /avoidant (c) Anx­
ious/resistant infants show limited exploration and play, tend to 
be highly distressed by the separation, and have great difficulty 
in settling afterwards, showing struggling, stiffness, continued 
crying, or fuss in a passive way. The caregiver's presence or 
attempts at comforting fail to reassure, and the infant's anxiety 
and anger appear to prevent him from deriving comfort from 
proximity. Secure infants' behavior is based on the experience of 
well-coordinated, sensitive interactions where the caregiver is 
rarely overarousing and is able to restabilize the child's disor­
ganizing emotional responses. Therefore, they remain relatively 
organized in stressful situations. Negative emotions feel less 
threatening and can be experienced as meaningful and commu­
nicative (Grossmann, Grossmann, and Schwan 1986; Sroufe 
1996). Anxious/avoidantly attached children are presumed to 
have had experiences where their emotional arousal was not 
restabilized by the caregiver, or where they were overaroused 
through intrusive parenting; therefore, they overregulate their 
affect and avoid situations that are likely to be distressing. 
Anxious/resistantly attached children underregulate, heighten­
ing their expression of distress, possibly in ah effort to elicit the 
expectable response of the caregiver. There is a low threshold for 
threat, and the child becomes preoccupied with having contact 
with the caregiver but is frustrated even when it is available 
(Sroufe 1996). (cfl A fourth group of infants exhibits seeming­
ly undirected behavior, such as freezing, hand-clapping, head-
banging, and the wish to escape the situation even in the 
presence of the caregiver. These infants are referred to as disor­
ganized/disoriented (Main and Solomon 1990). It is generally 
held that for such infants the caregiver has served as a source of 
both fear and reassurance, and thus arousal of the attachment 
behavioral system produces strong conflicting motivations. Attachment and Reflective Function / 39 
Not surprisingly, a history of prolonged or repeated separation 
(Chisolm 1998), intense marital conflict (Owen and Cox 1997), 
and severe neglect or physical or sexual abuse (Carlson,

this pattern. 
THE ATTACHMENT SYSTEM AS A DETERMINANT 
OF LATER INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
Bowlby proposed that internal working models of the self and 
others provide prototypes for all later relationships. Such models 
are relatively stable across the lifespan (Collins and Read 1994). 
Because internal working models function outside awareness, 
they are change-resistant (Crittenden 1990). The stability of 
attachment is demonstrated by longitudinal studies of infants 
assessed with the Strange Situation and followed up in adoles­
cence or young adulthood with the Adult Attachment Interview 
(AAI) (George, Kaplan, and Main 1985). This structured clinical 
instrument elicits narrative histories of childhood attachment 
relationships. The AAI scoring system (Main and Goldwyn 1994) 
classifies Individuals into Secure/Autonomous, Insecure/Dis­
missing, Insecure/Preoccupied, or Unresolved with respect to 
loss or trauma—categories based on the structural qualities of 
narratives of early experiences. While autonomous individuals 
value attachment relationships, coherently integrate memories 
into a meaningful narrative, and regard these as formative, 
insecure individuals are poor at integrating memories of experi­
ence with the meaning of that experience. Those dismissing of 
attachment show avoidance by denying memories and by idealiz­
ing or devaluing early relationships. Preoccupied individuals 
tend to be confused, angry, or fearful in relation to attachment 
figures, sometimes still complaining of childhood slights, echo­
ing the protests of the resistant infant. Unresolved individuals 
give indications of significant disorganization in their attach­
ment-relationship representation in semantic or syntactic con­
fusions in their narratives concerning childhood trauma or a 
recent loss.

40 / Theoretical Perspectives 
Major longitudinal studies (C. Hamilton 1994; M. Main 1997; 
Waters, Merrick, Albersheim, Treboux, and Crowell" 1995) have 
shown a 68-75% correspondence with attachment classifica­
tions in infancy and classifications in adulthood. This is an 
unparalleled level of consistency between behavior observed in 
infancy and outcomes in adulthood, although, obviously, such 
behavior may well be maintained by consistent environments as 
well as by patterns laid down in the first year of life. Moreover, 
attachment relationships play a key role in the transgenerational 
transmission of deprivation. Secure adults are three or four 
times more likely to have children who are securely attached to 
them (van IJzendoorn 1995). This is true even where parental 
attachment is assessed before the birth of the child (Steele, 
Steele, and Fonagy 1996; Ward and Carlson 1995). Parental 
attachment patterns predict variance in addition to tempera­
ment measures or contextual factors, such as life events, social 
support, and psychopathology (Steele, 1991). 
The attachment system (Bowlby 1969, 1973, 1980) is inti­
mately connected with the process of representational mapping 
and the development of the reflective function of the self. There 
is general agreement that, as the self exists only in the context 
of the other, the development of the self is tantamount to the 
aggregation of experiences of self in relationships (e.g., 
Crittenden 1994; Sroufe 1990). Psychoanalytic object relations 
(Kernberg 1982; Winnicott 1965) and attachment (Bowlby 1980) 
theorists are in agreement that repeated, invariant aspects of 
self-other relations are abstracted into internal representational 
mental models (Johnson-Laird 1983) and structured, to use 
Kernberg's term, into self-other-affect triads or internal working 
models, according to Bowlby. Although in its original formulation 
the concept of internal working model lacked specificity (Dunn 
1996), more recent empirical work by psychoanalytic clinicians 
has greatly improved the specificity of this construct (Horowitz 
1995; Luborsky and Luborsky 1995). 
At the same time, cognitive scientists have elaborated the 
notion of procedural memories based on the nonconscious 
implicit use of past experience (Johnson and Multhaup 1992; 
Kihlstrom and Hoyt 1990; Pillemer and White 1989; Schachter 
1992; Squire 1987; Tobias, Kihlstrom, and Schachter 1992). Attachment and Reflective Function / 41 
There is general agreement that the memory system is at least of 
a dual nature with two relatively independent, neurologically 
and psychologically homogeneous systems underpinning it. In 
addition to the autobiographical memory, which is at least 
in part accessible to awareness, an important additional com­
ponent to memory is a nonvoluntary system that is implicit, 
principally perceptual, nondeclarative, and nonreflective (D. L. 
Schachter 1992; Squire 1987). It is possible that it is, at least in 
certain respects, more dominated by emotional and impression­
istic information than its autobiographical counterpart (Pillemer 
and White 1989; Tobias et al. 1992; van der Kolk 1994). It stores 
the "how" of executing sequences of actions, motor skills being 
prototypical instances. The procedural knowledge that it con­
tains is accessible only through performance. It manifests itself 
only when the individual engages in the skills and operations 
into which knowledge is embedded. Given these features, it 
seems likely thatSthe schematic representations postulated by 
attachment and object-relations theorists are most usefully con­
strued as procedural memories, the function of which is to adapt 
social behavior to specific interpersonal contexts. 
The classification of patterns of attachment in infancy 
(Ainsworth et al. 1978) taps into procedural memory (Crittenden 
1990; Fonagy 1995a). The strength ofthe Strange Situation as a 
method of psychological assessment is that it provides a power­
ful analogue of past situational contexts within which knowledge 
concerning the "how" of behavior with a specific caregiver is 
accrued. In this sense attachment is a skill, one that is acquired 
in relation to a specific caregiver and encoded into a teleological 
model of behavior. In the London Parent-Child Study we investi­
gated the question of how well the Adult Attachment Interview, 
administered before the birth of the first child to 100 predomi­
nantly middle-class primiparous parents, could predict the clas­
sification of the infant's attachment at the age of 12 months to 
mother and at 18 months to father (Fonagy, Steele, and Steele 
1991). There was only a marginally significant association be­
tween the attachment classification with mother and that with 
father. However, both test results were powerfully predicted by 
the attachment classification of the respective parent on the AAI 
(Steele et al. 1996). The small overlap between the two sets of

Crittenden 1994; Sroufe 1990). Psychoanalytic object relations 
(Kernberg 1982; Winnicott 1965) and attachment (Bowlby 1980) 
theorists are in agreement that repeated, invariant aspects of 
self-other relations are abstracted into internal representational 
mental models (Johnson-Laird 1983) and structured, to use 
Kernberg's term, into self-other-affect triads or internal working 
models, according to Bowlby. Although in its original formulation 
the concept of internal working model lacked specificity (Dunn 
1996), more recent empirical work by psychoanalytic clinicians 
has greatly improved the specificity of this construct (Horowitz 
1995; Luborsky and Luborsky 1995). 
At the same time, cognitive scientists have elaborated the 
notion of procedural memories based on the nonconscious 
implicit use of past experience (Johnson and Multhaup 1992; 
Kihlstrom and Hoyt 1990; Pillemer and White 1989; Schachter 
1992; Squire 1987; Tobias, Kihlstrom, and Schachter 1992). Attachment and Reflective Function / 41 
There is general agreement that the memory system is at least of 
a dual nature with two relatively independent, neurologically 
and psychologically homogeneous systems underpinning it. In 
addition to the autobiographical memory, which is at least 
in part accessible to awareness, an important additional com­
ponent to memory is a nonvoluntary system that is implicit, 
principally perceptual, nondeclarative, and nonreflective (D. L. 
Schachter 1992; Squire 1987). It is possible that it is, at least in 
certain respects, more dominated by emotional and impression­
istic information than its autobiographical counterpart (Pillemer 
and White 1989; Tobias et al. 1992; van der Kolk 1994). It stores 
the "how" of executing sequences of actions, motor skills being 
prototypical instances. The procedural knowledge that it con­
tains is accessible only through performance. It manifests itself 
only when the individual engages in the skills and operations 
into which knowledge is embedded. Given these features, it 
seems likely thatSthe schematic representations postulated by 
attachment and object-relations theorists are most usefully con­
strued as procedural memories, the function of which is to adapt 
social behavior to specific interpersonal contexts. 
The classification of patterns of attachment in infancy 
(Ainsworth et al. 1978) taps into procedural memory (Crittenden 
1990; Fonagy 1995a). The strength ofthe Strange Situation as a 
method of psychological assessment is that it provides a power­
ful analogue of past situational contexts within which knowledge 
concerning the "how" of behavior with a specific caregiver is 
accrued. In this sense attachment is a skill, one that is acquired 
in relation to a specific caregiver and encoded into a teleological 
model of behavior. In the London Parent-Child Study we investi­
gated the question of how well the Adult Attachment Interview, 
administered before the birth of the first child to 100 predomi­
nantly middle-class primiparous parents, could predict the clas­
sification of the infant's attachment at the age of 12 months to 
mother and at 18 months to father (Fonagy, Steele, and Steele 
1991). There was only a marginally significant association be­
tween the attachment classification with mother and that with 
father. However, both test results were powerfully predicted by 
the attachment classification of the respective parent on the AAI 
(Steele et al. 1996). The small overlap between the two sets of 

42 / Theoretical Perspectives 
classifications could be equally well accounted for by assuming a 
temperament factor or by the generalization of the child's 
behavior with the mother (reflecting her attachment classifica­
tion) on his behavior with the father. The results suggest that 
the infant develops independent models (self-other schemata) for 
its major attachment relations based on its past history of inter­
actions with each of those individuals. These interaction experi­
ences are, in turn, indexed^ by the caregiver's representation of 
their attachment history. 
There has been considerable research on the manner in which 
representations of attachment might influence the caregiver's 
behavior with the child. Van Uzendoorn's (1995) comprehensive 
review identifies a "transmission gap," to the extent that the 
variability that AAI narratives and SSn classifications share 
is not accounted for by observational data concerning the 
sensitivity of caregiver behavior. Indeed, studies ofthe AAI-SSn 
association, which concurrently measured the sensitivity of 
caregiver-infant interaction; have yielded negative (Ward and 
Carlson 1995) or inconclusive (van Uzendoorn, Kranenburg, 
Zwart-Woudstra, Van Busschbach, and Lambermon 1991) re­
sults. Previously, we have suggested that the transmission gap 
may be a consequence of the limitations of measures of sensitiv­
ity (Fonagy, Steele, Moran, Steele, and Higgitt 1992; Fonagy, 
Steele, et al. 1995). Sensitivity is a generic construct covering a 
wide range of parental behaviors (Belsky, Rosenberger, and 
Cmic 1995). Not all of these may be equally relevant in engender­
ing secure attachment. If secure attachment is conceived of as 
the acquisition of procedures of goal-oriented rational action for 
the regulation of aversive states of arousal within an attachment 
context (Carlson and Sroufe 1995; Cassidy 1994; Sroufe 1996), 
we argue that these would be most consistently acquired and 
coherently represented when the child's acute affective state is 
accurately, but not overwhelmingly, reflected back to the child. 
The child who looks for a way of managing his distress finds 
in • the response of the caregiver a representation of his mental 
state that he may internalize and use as part of a higher-order 
strategy of affect regulation. The secure caregiver soothes by 
combining mirroring with a display that is incompatible with the Attachment and Reflective Function / 43 
child's affect (thus perhaps implying coping). This formulation of 
sensitivity has much in common with the notion of British 
psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion (1962a), of the role of the mother's 
capacity to mentally "contain" the affect state that feels intoler­
able to the baby and respond in terms of physical care in a 
manner that acknowledges the child's mental state, yet serves to 
modulate unmanageable feelings. The finding that the clarity 
and coherence of the mother's representation of the child medi­
ates between the AAI and mother's observed behavior is certainly 
consistent with this model (Slade, Belsky, Aber, and Phelps 
1999). Ratings of the quality of the reflective function of each 
caregiver were found independently to predict the child's secu­
rity of attachment in the London Parent-Child Study (Fonagy, 
Steele, Moran, Steele, and Higgitt 1991). 
If secure attachment is the outcome of successful contain­
ment, insecure attachment may be seen as the infant's identifi­
cation with the caregiver's defensive behavior. Proximity to the 
caregiver is maintained at the cost of reflective function. A dis­
missing (Ds) caregiver may altogether fail to mirror the child's 
distress because of the painful experiences this evokes for her or 
because she lacks the capacity to create a coherent image of the 
child's mental state. In contrast, the preoccupied (E) caregiver 
may represent the infant's state with excessive clarity or in a way 
that is complicated by responses to the parent's ambivalent 
preoccupation with her own experience, so much so that the 
symbolic potential of the exchange is lost. In both cases the 
infant internalizes the caregiver's attitude and "this dysynchrony 
becomes the content of the experience of the self (Crittenden 
1994, p. 89). 
We may speculate as to the impact of such a state of affairs 
on the development of the child's sense of self. We know that 
avoidant infants respond to separation with minimal displays of 
distress while experiencing considerable physiological arousal 
(Spangler and Grossmann 1993). Crittenden (1988; Crittenden 
and DiLalla 1988) reports that 1-year-old maltreated children 
display falsely positive affect that does not match their true 
feelings. At an extreme, the internalization of the caregiver's 
defenses can lead not only to a failure to represent and display

actual emotional experience adequately, but also to the con­
struction- of an experience of self around this false internaliza­
tion (Winnicott 1965). 
While the conscious experience of "putting on an act" may be 
a fairly general experience, particularly in adolescence (Harter, 
Marold, Whitesell, and Cobbs 1996), in the current context we 
are referring to the highly distressing experience of severe­
ly personality-disordered children who experience a sense of 
alienation from their core self (Bleiberg 1984, 1994). A strategy 
adopted by many such children somewhat later in development 
is to attempt to externalize this false part of their self-represen­
tation and manipulate the behaviors of others around them so 
that these match the incongruent self-representation. We would 
argue that this model explains the strangely coercive behavior 
with the caregiver of preschool children whose attachment at the 
stage of infancy was classified as disorganized (Cassidy, Marvin, 
and The MacArthur Working Group on Attachment 1989; Crit­
tenden 1992; Main and Cassidy 1988). These children—and 
adults—become quite skilled and sensitive in manipulating oth­
ers to get them to behave consistently with their internal repre­
sentations. These are not their representations of self-other 
relationships, which we all try to actualize. In a far more desper­
ate way these children and adults try to provoke behavior con­
sistent with a part of the self-representation experienced as 
"alien," which they feel forced to externalize in order to achieve a 
more coherent perception of the residual self (Fonagy and Target 
1995). 
ATTACHMENT SECURITY IN THE CHILD 
AND REFLECTIVE FUNCTION 
There is general agreement that the "harmoniousness of the 
mother-child' relationship contributes to the emergence of 
symbolic thought" (Bretherton, Bates, Benigni, Camaioni, and 
Volterra 1979, p. 224), and the idea has a long and distin­
guished history (Mahler, Pine, and Bergman 1975; Vygotsky 
1978; Werner and Kaplan 1963). Bowlby (1969) recognized the Attachment and Reflective Function / 45 
significance of the developmental step entailed in the emergence 
of "the child's capacity both to conceive of his mother as having 
her own goals and'interests separate from his own and to take 
them into account" (1969, p. 368). Moss, Parent, and Gosselin 
(1995) reported that attachment security with mother was a 
good concurrent predictor of metacognitive capacity in the child 
in the domains of memory, comprehension, and communication. 
The Separation Anxiety Test, a projective test of attachment 
security, has been shown to be a good predictor of belief-desire 
reasoning capacity in 3V4- to 6-year-old children when age, 
verbal mental age, and social maturity were all controlled for 
(Fonagy, Redfern, and Charman 1997). 
In a prospective study ofthe relationship of attachment secu­
rity to mother (12 months) and to father (18 months) and per­
formance on three tests of theory of mind at 5V4 years (Fonagy 
1997), 92 of 96 children tested in the Strange Situation at 12 
and 18 months were seen. Of those classified as secure at 12 
months with mother, 82% passed the belief-desire reasoning 
task, in which the child is challenged to predict what a character 
would feel, based on his or her knowledge of the character's 
belief. (If Ellie thinks the can has coke in it, and likes coke, will 
she want the drink—even though it is really milk?) In contrast, 
46% of those who had been classified as Insecure failed. Infant-
father attachment (at 18 months) also predicted the child's per­
formance, with 77% of infants classified as secure passing the 
test, compared to 55% of children classified as insecure. There 
was some indication of an additive relationship, in that 87% of 
children with two secure relationships passed the belief-desire 
task, and 63% of those with only one secure relationship and 
only 50% of those Insecure with both did so. A similar but 
somewhat weaker pattern could be observed with the second-
order false-belief task, which requires the child to reason on the 
basis of what one character knows about another character's 
wrong belief. Of those secure with both parents, 36% passed, 
compared with 23% who were secure with one and 9% who were 
insecure with both. 
In a somewhat smaller but nevertheless careful longitudinal 
study of mother-infant dyads, Meins and colleagues (Meins, 
Fernyhough, Russel, and Clark-Carter 1998) reported that 83%

of children who were securely attached in infancy passed a false-
belief task at the age of 4, in comparison with 33% of insecurely 
attached peers. At age 5, 85% of securely attached children and 
50% of insecurely attached ones passed a task requiring an 
understanding of information access. Although the study was 
not .able to replicate our results on the false-belief and emotion 
task (probably because of its small sample), the general trend of 
the findings confirms that security of attachment is significantly 
linked to symbolic abilities in general and to precocious men­
talizing in particular. 
Both trivial and substantive explanations could be offered to 
account for these findings. They would be trivial if the association 
of secure attachment and false-belief understanding were due to 
an as yet unknown and unmeasured third factor, such as tem­
perament. More plausibly, it could be argued that the facilitative 
effect of secure attachment is due to a more relaxed, task-
oriented attitude, to a general facility to engage in a cognitively 
demanding task, or to an ability to relate to an adult experi­
menter in a playful, exploratory way. All these explanations 
reflect child performance rather than competence. This sugges­
tion could be tested using a false-belief task where implicit and 
explicit knowledge of false belief is separately assessed (Clements 
and Perner 1994). If attachment security relates to performance, 
then securely attached children would be expected to do better 
only on the explicit (verbal/pointing) task. Implicit, procedural 
false-belief reasoning would be expected to be facilitated by 
secure attachment only if this was associated with superior 
reflective capacity. This remains to be studied. In what follows, 
we shall cautiously assume that the relationship between false-
belief reasoning and security of attachment is nontrivial. 
There are two alternative explanations for this relationship: 
(a) One class of models would suggest that security of attach­
ment in infancy predisposes children to benefit from certain 
social processes that may be directly involved in the development 
of reflective abilities and social understanding, (b) The second 
class of models would suggest that security of attachment is an 
indicator of that quality of infant-caregiver relationship which 
generates psychological understanding. In this second model the Attachment and Reflective Function / 47 
social processes that accelerate the mentalizing quality of self-
organization are the very same as those that ensure security of 
attachment. 
Mediatlonal models would require that two conditions be 
satisfied: (a) compelling evidence that a specific set of social 
processes is involved in this aspect of the development of self-
organization, and (b) that such social processes are enhanced in 
securely attached individuals. At least three candidates meet 
these criteria. 
1. The first is pretense. There is evidence that children in their 
thtrd year who engage more readily in cooperative interaction 
(Dunn et al. 1991), and specifically in joint pretend play (Asting-
ton and Jenkins 1995; Taylor, Gerdw, and Carlson 1993; Young-
blade and Dunn 1995), show superior mind-reading and emotion 
understanding performance. A separate body of observations 
from longitudinal studies of attachment indicates that preschool 
children who were securely attached to their mother in infancy 
manifest stronger engagement in fantasy play than do avoidant 
children, whose level of engagement is low and whose pretend 
play is impoverished (Rosenberg, cited in Carlson and Sroufe 
1995; Main, Kaplan, and Cassidy 1985). Children rated as 
securely attached to their mothers during infancy have been 
reported to engage in more frequent and sophisticated solo 
pretense, (Belsky, Garduque, and Hrncir 1984; Bretherton et al. 
1979; Matas, Arend, and Sroufe 1978). Slade (1987) found that 
maternal involvement in 3-year-olds' play served a facilitating 
function only for securely attached children. Meins and col­
leagues (Meins et al. 1998).demonstrated that children who were 
classified as securely attached in infancy were better able to 
incorporate the pretense suggestions of an experimenter in their 
play at 31 months. 
It is probable that joint pretend play or playfulness fosters the 
understanding of mental states. Deliberate role-taking is seen as 
being integral to the "off-line simulation" model of the perform­
ance of mindrreading tasks (Currie 1995; Goldman 1989). Within 
other models, pretend play is an early manifestation of the 
theory-of-mind mechanisms (Leslie 1987). The question of why

classified as securely attached in infancy were better able to 
incorporate the pretense suggestions of an experimenter in their 
play at 31 months. 
It is probable that joint pretend play or playfulness fosters the 
understanding of mental states. Deliberate role-taking is seen as 
being integral to the "off-line simulation" model of the perform­
ance of mindrreading tasks (Currie 1995; Goldman 1989). Within 
other models, pretend play is an early manifestation of the 
theory-of-mind mechanisms (Leslie 1987). The question of why 

48 / Theoretical Perspectives 
3-year-olds can understand that someone is entertaining a pre­
tend representation but not a false belief (Harris and Kavanaugh 
1993; Harris, Kavanaugh, and Meredith 1994), a pretend/real 
distinction but not an appearance/reality one (Flavell, Flavell, 
and Green 1987) is an important puzzle. In the case of pretend, 
the representations, while they are different from reality, are 
shared by those engaged in the pretend game. As Astington put 
it: "they are intermental, not intramental" (1996, p. 193). The 
sharing of representations that are different from reality may 
help in understanding situations where representations are not 
only" different from reality but are not shared in a social pretend 
domain. In joint pretend play or playfulness the adult adopts the 
child's mental stance and re-presents it to the child in relation to 
a third object, which is symbolically held in mind by both. 
Pretending requires a mental stance involving the symbolic 
transformation of reality in the presence of, and with a view to, 
the mind of the other. The adult, or perhaps the older sibling, 
holds the frame of external reality while accurately representing 
the child's mental state. The scaffolding provided by the child's 
playmate in pretend play (Vygotsky 1967) not only promotes 
earlier success but is the mechanism whereby the development 
of reflection comes about. Lillard (1993) argued that symbolic 
play may offer a "zone of proximal development" for the skills 
that subserve mind-reading ability. Children with a secure at­
tachment history may be more likely.to engage in an activity that 
presumes a degree of trust, insofar as the child relies on the 
other's version or perception of reality. 
2. The second is talking. There is evidence that conversations 
about feelings and the reasons behind people's actions are linked 
to the relatively early achievement of reflective function (Brown, 
Donelan-McCall, and Dunn 1996; Dunn and Brown 1993). 
Mothers who spontaneously explained their emotions to 3V£-
year-olds during laboratory simulation were shown to have chil­
dren with enhanced emotion understanding over the subsequent 
15-month period (Denham et al. 1994). Conversational opportu­
nities concerning mental states appear to improve children's 
mentalizing performance in experimental studies (Appleton and 
Reddy 1996). 
a Attachment and Reflective Function / 49 
Strage and Main (cited in Carlson and Sroufe 1995) reported 
that discourse patterns between mothers and children at age 6 
could be predicted from early attachment classification. Secure 
dyads were more fluent and able to discuss a wider range of 
topics than those classified as avoidant, who showed little topic 
elaboration. Patterns of mother-child interaction characteristic 
of secure dyads—shared play, comforting, or joking—also define 
the contexts within which the mother's explanations of mental 
states are found to be particularly facilitative of reflective func­
tion (Dunn 1996). Secure children find it easier to deal with 
emotional issues in an open and free way (Bretherton, Ridgeway, 
and Cassidy 1990; Cassidy 1988). Mother-child verbal interac­
tions associated with the early acquisition of reflective capacity 
predominantly concern emotionally charged matters (Dunn 
1996). Secure attachment may then engender patterns of verbal 
interaction between child and caregiver, which in turn support 
thinking about feelings and intentions. 
P. K. Smith (1996) forcefully advanced the central role of 
language in the acquisition of mentalizing capacity. Using pri­
mate evidence, he suggested that the availability of symbolic 
codes (words) for mental states was crucial for the developing 
individual to acquire mind-reading abilities, and the explicit use 
of such codes by caregivers was therefore likely to be important. 
Even more pertinent in this context is Harris's (1996) proposal 
that the experience of engaging in conversations per se alerts 
children to the fact that people are receivers and providers of 
information, irrespective of whether that conversation involves 
reference to mental states (knowing, thinking, desiring, etc.). The 
structure of information-bearing conversations (e.g., being told 
about a past event that one has not witnessed, challenging of 
information in dissent and denial, or filling in information gaps 
in questions or when information exchange misfires and repair is 
needed) strongly implies that partners in a conversation differ in 
what they know and believe about a shared topic. Effective 
conversation requires that gaps in shared knowledge and belief 
are acknowledged and addressed. The measurement of attach­
ment in adults (Main and Goldwyn 1994) strongly endorses the 
suggestion that secure attachment is associated with greater 
sensitivity to the rules of conversation as defined by Grice (1975).

3. The third potential mediator is peer group interaction. We 
have already noted that the possibility of interaction with sib­
lings is likely to enhance theory-of-mind performance (Jenkins 
and Astington 1996; Perner et al. 1994; Ruffman et al. 1998). 
Importantly, the child's use of mental-state terms with siblings 
or friends is a better predictor of performance on false-belief 
tasks than is mother-child conversation (Brown et al. 1996). 
Likewise, Lewis and colleagues (Lewis, Freeman, Kyriakidou, 
Maridaki-Kassotaki, and Berridge 1996) demonstrated that 
false-belief understanding was related to the amount of time that 
children spent with older siblings, older friends, and older kin, 
but not with younger persons. There is an independent body of 
evidence that supports a strong link between secure attachment 
in infancy and ratings of peer competence (Elicker, Englund, and 
Sroufe 1992). Children with secure attachment histories are 
consistently observed and rated more socially oriented, capable 
of reciprocity, popular, and empathic than those with insecure 
histories (Lieberman 1977; Pancake 1985; Park and Waters 
1989; Sroufe 1983). 
Both simulation theory and theory-theory explanations of the 
development of mihd-reading offer good explanations ofthe facil-
itative effect of more intense peer-group interaction (Ruffman et 
al. 1998). Peer-group interaction should increase the opportuni­
ties that children have for simulation, imagining what they 
would see, think, feel, and so on if they were in another person's 
situation. Equally, interaction with peers or older siblings could 
be seen from a theory-theory perspective as a rich source of 
ideas about how the mind works. An alternative view may be that 
enculturation is itself the source of the child's mental-state 
concepts (Astington 1996). Bruner (1983) proposed that parents' 
tendency to treat the infant's spontaneous gestures as if they 
were intentional communications leads to infants seeing 
themselves as having intentions and starting to communicate 
intentionally. The social world—in the first instance, the par­
ent—fosters the child's sense of his mental self through complex 
linguistic and interactional processes, behaving toward the in­
fant in a way that leads him eventually to share the assumption 
that his own behavior and (by simulation or the observation of Attachment and Reflective Function / 51 
similar interactions between the caregiver and others) that 
of others may be best understood in terms of mental states. 
Through participation in activities of their culture they come to 
share their culture's way of regarding others' and their own 
actions. If children's entry into the folk psychology is viewed as a 
process of "apprenticeship" in which senior peers and caregivers 
are seen as encouraging the child's adoption of mentalizing 
concepts (Astington 1996; Lewis et al. 1996), then secure attache 
ment may be considered as a kind of catalyst to this learning 
process. The greater readiness with which secure children are 
willing to explore and engage with the social world could then 
account for their relative competence in mentalizing abilities. 
There is nothing mutually exclusive about these three rnedia-
tional models. Pretense often involves the use of mental-state 
language. Interaction with peers often involves both language 
and pretense. In general, these mediational models suggest that 
propensity for social engagement across a number of contexts 
enhances the development of social understanding and that 
such social engagement is more readily accessible in the families 
of securely attached young children. However, there is a major 
problem with such a singular model. Evidence from Dunn's work 
suggests that these different contexts correlate poorly with one 
another (Dunn 1996). For example, observational data indicate 
that individual differences found in pretend play, management of 
conflict, and discourse about mental states are not correlated 
among social situations (mothers, siblings, close friend), al­
though each correlates with socio-cognitive assessments (Brown 
et al. 1996; Slomkowski and Dunn 1992; Youngblade and Dunn 
1995). The fact that children's behavior correlates poorly across 
social partners and situations, although each of those situations 
relates to test performance, could suggest that there are several 
independent, simultaneously operating pathways between at­
tachment and social situations. 
Alternatively, it is possible that the variables that prima facie 
may be considered to be mediating the attachment/mind-read­
ing relationship are not on the causal path at all, that their 
correlation with the rate of acquisition of mind-reading is spuri-

ous, and that the causal sequence of the relationship does not 
involve these social experiences but is directly related to the 
child's attachment status. The early experience with the care­
givers in the first year of life may create the bedrock of theory-of-
mind competence, ensuring the child's move from a teleological 
to a mentalizing model of behavior. What evidence do we have to 
support such a contention? First, it is important to note that in 
the London data, a mother's attachment classification before the 
birth of the child was a powerful predictor of the child's theory-
of-mind competence at 5 years; 75% of children of secure, au­
tonomous mothers passed the cognitive-emotion task, whereas 
only 16% of children of preoccupied mothers and 25% of those of 
unresolved mothers did so (Fonagy 1997). Although on the face 
of it this could be accounted for by the models already discussed, 
we believe that there is now evidence that the caregiver brings 
something to the parent-child relationship, evident even before 
the birth'of the child, which may be critical in the child's estab­
lishment of both secure attachment and mind-reading. 
What might this be? It is well established that, in infancy, 
mothers of securely attached children are more sensitive to their 
children's needs (Ainsworth, Bell, and Stayton 1971; Isabella 
1993). We have already touched on the fact that the caregiver's 
capacity to envision the mental states of her own parents is 
predictive of the infant's security of attachment to each of his 
caregivers (Fonagy, Steele, Moran, et al. 1991). In the London 
project, mothers who were more likely to invoke mental states in 
their accounts of their childhood attachment experiences had 
children with superior mind-reading abilities (controlling for ver­
bal fluency in the child). Ratings on the RF scale were found to 
predict the child's performance on cognitive-emotion tasks also 
for fathers. Even more important, a path analysis revealed that a 
mother's capacity to reflect on her own childhood in the AAI 
shared that portion of the variance with the child's theory-of-
mind performance that was predicted by the quality of mother-
infant attachment. In a more complex path analysis, we found 
that the mother's mentalizing ability had a direct as well as 
indirect relationship with the child's theory of mind. Thus, the 
child's attachment security was not the only predictor. The Attachment and Reflective Function / 53 
mother's capacity to envision the child as a mental entity also 
seemed to be important. 
Such data suggest that common mechanisms underpin at­
tachment organization in the caregiver and the infant and the 
precocious emergence of mentalizing. It should be remembered 
that no unequivocal causal paths were identified among medi-
ational models. The relative importance of various potential 
mediational mechanisms for the attachment-theory-of-mind re­
lationship varies according to context, but intergenerational data 
may be consistent with at least two of the models (pretense, 
language). Further experimental research that manipulates pa­
rental behavior and explores attachment and theory-of-mind 
task performance (van Uzendoorn, Juffer, and Duyvesteyn 1995) 
will be necessary to determine whether specific behaviors that 
engender secure attachment simultaneously enhance mental­
izing. In order for such a study to be feasible, we need a model of 
how attachment may directly relate to theory-of-mind perform­
ance. Next, therefore, we offer one model of how such a mecha­
nism may operate. 
Our stipulation is based on the assumption that the acquisi­
tion of the theory of mind is part of an intersubjective process 
between the infant and caregiver (see Gopnik 1993, for a highly 
elegant elaboration of such a model). In our view, the caregiver 
facilitates the creation of mentalizing models through complex 
linguistic and quasHinguistic processes, primarily by behaving 
toward the child in such a way that the child is eventually led to 
postulate that his own behavior may be best understood if he 
assumes that he has ideas and beliefs, feelings and wishes, that 
determine his actions, and the reactions of others to him can 
then be generalized to other similar beings. The caregiver ap­
proaches the crying infant with a question in her mind: "Do you 
want your nappy changed?" "Do you need a cuddle?" The sensi­
tive caregiver is unlikely to address the situation without having 
the person in mind, so is unlikely to say to herself, "Are you wet 
around your bottom?" or ".Have you been standing alone too 
long?" The sensitive caregiver can bridge the focus on physical 
reality and internally directed attention sufficiently for the child

ence. Ultimately, the child arrives at the conclusion that the 
caregiver's reaction to him may be understood as rational, given 
the assumption of an internal state of belief or desire within 
himself. Unconsciously and pervasively, the caregiver ascribes a 
mental state to the child with her behavior, treating the child as 
a mental agent. This is ultimately perceived by the child and 
used in the elaboration of teleological models and permits the 
development of a core sense of selfhood*organized along mental-
istic lines. We assume that this, by and large, is a mundane 
process, in the sense of happening every day throughout early 
life, and that it is a process that is preconscious to both infant 
and caregiver, inaccessible to reflection or modification. Care­
givers, however, execute this most natural of human functions 
in different ways. Some may be particularly alert to the earliest 
indications of intentionality, while others may need stronger 
indications before they can perceive the child's mental state and 
modify their behavior accordingly. 
The child's development and perception of mental states in 
himself and others thus depends on his observation of the 
mental world of his caregiver. He develops a concept and is thus 
able to perceive mental states, to the extent that his caregiver's 
behavior implies such states. He does this when the caregiver is 
in a shared pretend mode of "playing" with the child (hence the 
association.between pretend and early mentalization), and many 
more mundane interactions (such as conversations and peer 
interaction) will also involve such shared mentation. This is what 
makes mental-state concepts such as thinking inherently inter­
subjective; shared experience is part of the very logic of mental-
state concepts. 
We believe that the caregiver's capacity to observe the mo­
ment-to-moment changes in the child's mental state is critical in 
the development of mentalizing capacity. The caregiver's percep­
tion of the child as an intentional being lies at the root of 
sensitive caregiving, which attachment theorists view as the 
cornerstone of secure attachment (Ainsworth et al. 1978; Bates, 
Maslin, and Frankel 1985; Belsky and Isabella 1988; Egeland 
and Farber 1984; Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, 
and Unzner 1985; Isabella 1993; Isabella and Belsky 1991). Attachment and Reflective Function / 55 
Secure attachment, in its turn, provides the psychosocial basis 
for acquiring an understanding of mind. The secure infant feels 
safe in making attributions of mental states to account for the 
behavior of the caregiver. In contrast the avoidant child shuns to 
some degree the mental state of the other, while the resistant 
child focuses on its own state of distress, to the exclusion of 
close intersubjective exchanges. Disorganized infants may repre­
sent a special category: hypervigilant of the caregiver's behavior, 
they use all cues available for prediction; they may be acutely 
sensitized to intentional states and thus may be more ready to 
construct a mentalized account of the caregiver's behavior. We 
would argue (see below) that in such children mentalization may 
be evident, but it does not have the central role in self-organiza­
tion that characterizes securely attached children. We believe 
that what is most important for the development of mentalizing 
self-organization is the exploration of the mental state of the 
sensitive caregiver, which enables the child to find in the care­
giver's mind (that is, in the hypothetical representation of her 
mind that he constructs to explain her behavior toward him) an 
image of himself as motivated by beliefs, feelings, and intentions. 
In contrast, what the disorganized child is scanning for so in­
tently is not the representation of his own mental states in the 
mind of the other, but the mental states of that other that 
threaten to undermine his own self. They can constitute within 
the child's self-representation an alien presence that is so 
unbearable that his attachment behavior becomes organized 
around reexternalizing these parts of the self onto attachment 
figures, rather than around the internalization of a capacity for 
containment of affects and other intentional states. There is 
considerable evidence to support the view that secure attach­
ment enhances the development of the self, inner security, 
feeling of self-worth, self-reliance, and personal power of the 
emerging self as well as the development of autonomy (Bates et 
al. 1985; Gove 1983; Londerville and Main 1981; Matas et al. 
1978). Disorganized infants, even if they acquire the skill of 
mind-reading, fail to integrate this with their self-organization. 
There may be a number of linked reasons for this: (a) The 
child needs to use disproportionate resources to understand

ence. Ultimately, the child arrives at the conclusion that the 
caregiver's reaction to him may be understood as rational, given 
the assumption of an internal state of belief or desire within 
himself. Unconsciously and pervasively, the caregiver ascribes a 
mental state to the child with her behavior, treating the child as 
a mental agent. This is ultimately perceived by the child and 
used in the elaboration of teleological models and permits the 
development of a core sense of selfhood*organized along mental-
istic lines. We assume that this, by and large, is a mundane 
process, in the sense of happening every day throughout early 
life, and that it is a process that is preconscious to both infant 
and caregiver, inaccessible to reflection or modification. Care­
givers, however, execute this most natural of human functions 
in different ways. Some may be particularly alert to the earliest 
indications of intentionality, while others may need stronger 
indications before they can perceive the child's mental state and 
modify their behavior accordingly. 
The child's development and perception of mental states in 
himself and others thus depends on his observation of the 
mental world of his caregiver. He develops a concept and is thus 
able to perceive mental states, to the extent that his caregiver's 
behavior implies such states. He does this when the caregiver is 
in a shared pretend mode of "playing" with the child (hence the 
association.between pretend and early mentalization), and many 
more mundane interactions (such as conversations and peer 
interaction) will also involve such shared mentation. This is what 
makes mental-state concepts such as thinking inherently inter­
subjective; shared experience is part of the very logic of mental-
state concepts. 
We believe that the caregiver's capacity to observe the mo­
ment-to-moment changes in the child's mental state is critical in 
the development of mentalizing capacity. The caregiver's percep­
tion of the child as an intentional being lies at the root of 
sensitive caregiving, which attachment theorists view as the 
cornerstone of secure attachment (Ainsworth et al. 1978; Bates, 
Maslin, and Frankel 1985; Belsky and Isabella 1988; Egeland 
and Farber 1984; Grossmann, Grossmann, Spangler, Suess, 
and Unzner 1985; Isabella 1993; Isabella and Belsky 1991). Attachment and Reflective Function / 55 
Secure attachment, in its turn, provides the psychosocial basis 
for acquiring an understanding of mind. The secure infant feels 
safe in making attributions of mental states to account for the 
behavior of the caregiver. In contrast the avoidant child shuns to 
some degree the mental state of the other, while the resistant 
child focuses on its own state of distress, to the exclusion of 
close intersubjective exchanges. Disorganized infants may repre­
sent a special category: hypervigilant of the caregiver's behavior, 
they use all cues available for prediction; they may be acutely 
sensitized to intentional states and thus may be more ready to 
construct a mentalized account of the caregiver's behavior. We 
would argue (see below) that in such children mentalization may 
be evident, but it does not have the central role in self-organiza­
tion that characterizes securely attached children. We believe 
that what is most important for the development of mentalizing 
self-organization is the exploration of the mental state of the 
sensitive caregiver, which enables the child to find in the care­
giver's mind (that is, in the hypothetical representation of her

threaten to undermine his own self. They can constitute within

mind-reading, fail to integrate this with their self-organization. 
There may be a number of linked reasons for this: (a) The 
child needs to use disproportionate resources to understand

the parent's behavior, at the expense of reflecting on self-states, 
(b) The caregiver of the disorganized infant is less likely to be 
reliably contingent in responding to the infant's self-state and, 
further, to show systematic biases in her perception and reflec­
tion of the child's state, (c) The mental state of the caregiver of 
the disorganized infant evokes intense anxiety either through 
frightening behavior suggesting malevolence toward the child or 
through behavior suggesting fear, including inexplicable fear of 
the child himself. 
These factors may combine to make disorganized infants 
become keen readers of the caregiver's mind under certain cir­
cumstances but, we suggest, poor readers of their own mental 
states. Thus, in terms of the rival models of theory-of-mind 
development, such children may acquire a theory-theory of mind 
but be unable to use simulation of mentalizing with the same 
confidence as can children whose attachment (albeit insecure) is 
coherent and organized. The alternative models may be more 
usefully thought of as alternative routes to mentalization, the 
first (theory-theory) accessible to all, the second (simulation) 
more readily available to children whose early attachment rela­
tionships made such a strategy more attractive and desirable. 
In chapter 6, we attempt to describe the normal development 
of reflective function in the child aged 2 to 5 years. We suggest 
that there is a transition from a dual mode of experience io 
mentalization. Primarily from a clinical perspective, we advance 
a number of propositions concerning the development of the 
psychological part ofthe self. These are: 
1. In early childhood, reflective function is characterized by two 
modes of relating internal experiences to the external situation: 
[a] In a serious frame of mind, the child expects the internal 
world in himself and others to correspond to external reality, and 
subjective experience will often be distorted to match information 
coming from outside—psychic equivalence mode (e.g., Gopnik 
and Astington 1988; Perner, Leekam, and Wimmer 1987). (b) 
While involved in play, the child knows that internal experience 
may not reflect external reality (e.g., Bartsch and Wellman 1989; 
Dias and Harris 1990), but then the internal state is thought to Attachment and Reflective Function / 57 
have no relationship to the outside world and to have no implica­
tions for it {pretend mode). 
2. In normal development, the child integrates these two modes 
to arrive at the stage of mentalization—or reflective mode—in 
which mental states can be experienced as representations. 
Inner and outer reality can then be seen as linked, yet they are 
accepted as differing in important ways and no longer have to be 
either equated or dissociated from each other (Baron-Cohen 
1995; Gopnik 1993). 
3. We have hypothesized that mentalization normally comes 
about through the child's experience of his mental states being 
reflected on, prototypically through experience of secure play 
with a parent or older child, which facilitates integration ofthe 
pretend and psychic equivalence modes, through an interper­
sonal process that is perhaps an elaboration of the complex 
mirroring of the infant by the caregiver. In playfulness, the 
caregiver gives the child's ideas and feelings (when he is "only 
pretending") a link with reality by indicating the existence of an 
alternative perspective, which exists outside the child's mind. 
The parent or older child also shows that reality may be distorted 
by acting upon it in playful ways, and through this playfulness a 
pretend but real mental experience may be introduced. 
4. In traumatized children, intense emotion and associated 
conflict can be thought of as having led to a partial failure of this 
integration, so that aspects of the pretend mode of functioning 
become part of a psychic equivalence manner of experiencing 
reality. This may be because where maltreatment or trauma has 
occurred within the family, the atmosphere tends to be incom­
patible with the caregiver "playing with" the most pressing as­
pects of the child's thoughts; these are often disturbing and 
unacceptable to the adult, just as they are to the child. The rigid 
and controlling behavior of the preschool child with a history of 
disorganized attachment is thus seen as arising out of a partial 
failure on the part of the child to move beyond the mode of 
psychic equivalence in relation to specific ideas or feelings, so

that he experiences them with the intensity that might be ex­

THE IMPLICATIONS OF REFLECTIVE FUNCTION 
FOR SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
"Mind-reading" may not be an unequivocally positive experience. 
Judy Dunn's work, however, gives us an indication that at least 
the understanding of emotion at the age of 3V4 predicts a positive 
perception of social relations, mature moral sensibility, and the 
understanding of complex emotions (Herrera and Dunn 1997). 
Stern (1985) pointed out that a sense of ownership of one's 
actions—whether derived from the experience of forming plans, 
proprioceptive feedback, or the objective consequences of physi­
cal actions on the environment—contributes significantly to the 
sense of self-agency. In our view, such agency also crucially 
depends on the quality and reliability of reflective function, as 
ownership of action is intimately tied to the mental state (belief 
or desire) that initiated it. It is impossible to conceive of self-
agency as fully established by the actual actions of the child, as 
such a large proportion of these will fail to achieve their intended 
objective because of the child's immature physical and cognitive 
capacities. In fact, it could be argued that if the sense of self-
agency were uniquely based on feedback from immature action 
systems, deficiency in this sphere would be universal. The recog­
nition of the child's intentional stance by (older) others must, 
then, be critical in making the thought "real" for the child. 
Interpersonal interaction that permits the registration of percep­
tions, thoughts, and emotions as causes and consequences of 
action and the contemplation of these mental states without fear 
must constitute an important part of the foundation of self-
agency. The earliest foundation is presumably the baby's sense 
that he brings about the caregiver's mirroring behavior (Gergely 
and Watson 1996). This idea is at the core of chapter 4. 
Of course, the core of self-agency must lie in the body, where 
the infant's effort to be in control often succeeds after the earli­
est times. However, more complex actions, particularly those : Attachment and Reflective Function / 59 
that involve others in the child's world, frequently require the 
reflective caregiver to make sense of the young child's wishes 
and to express these, if the two-way connection between inten­
tions and action is to be established. Hence, those who have 
experienced severe neglect or coercive, rigid, frightening, and, at 
an extreme, abusive parenting will frequently experience their 
sense of self-agency as massively curtailed and confined to the 
more finnly established bodily domain (see chapters 9 and 10 for 
a full exploration of this idea). 
The model of the development of mentalizing capacity that 
we propose has considerable clinical implications. For example, 
in a study of attachment classification in patients with severe 
personality disorders, Fonagy et al. (1996) found that the AAI 
narratives of borderline-personality-disordered patients had 
lower reflective function, coupled with histories of severe trauma, 
which was apparently unresolved. The findings suggest that, 
given a sensitive attachment relationship, which provides the 
intersubjective basis for the development of mentalizing capac­
ity, trauma (even if severe) is more likely to be resolved. Severe 
distortion of personality follows when abuse or neglect leads to a 
defensive inhibition of mentalization. Similarly, evidence is accu­
mulating that among juvenile offenders, where histories of mal­
treatment are common, capacities for mentalization are severely 
restricted (Blair 1995; Levinson and Fonagy 2000). The evidence 
on disturbances of mentalization among clinical groups is elabo­
rated more fully in later chapters (see chapters 10 and 11 in 
particular). 
A DEVELOPMENTAL FRAMEWORK 
FOR ABNORMAL REFLECTIVE FUNCTION 
It would be undoubtedly overly simplistic to make an absolute 
connection between developmental disorder and nonreflective-
ness. There are variations across situations, or, perhaps more 
accurately, across relationships. The delinquent adolescent is 
well aware of the mental states of other gang members, and the 
borderline individual at times seems hypersensitive to the affec-

A DEVELOPMENTAL FRAMEWORK 
FOR ABNORMAL REFLECTIVE FUNCTION 
It would be undoubtedly overly simplistic to make an absolute 
connection between developmental disorder and nonreflective-
ness. There are variations across situations, or, perhaps more 
accurately, across relationships. The delinquent adolescent is 
well aware of the mental states of other gang members, and the 
borderline individual at times seems hypersensitive to the affec-

60 / Theoretical Perspectives 
tive states of mental health professionals and family members. 
These "anomalies" may be clarified by more sophisticated devel­
opmental theory. 
Our chosen framework is provided by "dynamic skills theory" 
(Fischer and Farrar 1987; Fischer, Kenny, and Pipp 1990), which 
depicts development as a person's elaboration of progressively 
more complex control systems (skills). Reflective function may be 
readily conceived of as one such control system, critical to the 
organization of the self. Within dynamic skills theory, reflective 
function would be seen as not simply a property of the person, 
but ofthe person and situation together, because all skills are 
composed of both the person's activities and the situations or 
context within which these occur. Particular tasks, specific 
events, other people, as well as culture are seen as part of the 
skill. Furthermore, the development of a skill is not seen as 
progression along any singular path, determined by maturation. 
Rather, reflective function, as a skill, evolves through varied 
pathways, molded by many dynamically interacting influences, 
such as the individual's emotions, social interaction, family rela­
tionships and environment, important social groups, the reac­
tions ofthe wider social world,, and so forth (Fischer.Knight, and 
VanParys 1993). 
Reflective function is a strand within the developmental 
web, one of the many distinct control systems that are neither 
strongly connected with each other nor coordinated or integrated 
(Fischer and Pipp 1984). The "fractionation" or splitting of all 
abilities as a function of tasks and domains is well demon­
strated, and we might expect reflective function to be subject 
to the same kind of developmental decalage [unevenness] that 
characterizes the rest of cognitive development (Flavell 1982). 
"Fractionation" refers to the tendency for a person not to coordi­
nate skills or experiences that are-naturally separate but may 
be thought of as belonging together by some external criterion 
(Fischer and Ayoub 1994). Just as the understanding of conser­
vation of liquid does not generalize to conservation of area, 
reflective capacity in one domain of interpersonal interaction 
should not be expected to generalize to others. Reflective func­
tion does not begin as a general capacity, but is a particular skill 
tied to the task and domain where it is learned—a specific 
& Attachment and Reflective Function / 61 
category of relationship. Reflective function as a skill may be 
more or less present in situations as a function of contextual 
support and emotional states that push an individual up or 
down a developmental strand. Differences in the meaning of an 
interaction as well as its physical context can lead to fraction­
ation. For example, the concept of conservation of liquid may not 
generalize between the experimental task and one that involves 
helping a thirsty friend, even if both involve pouring a glass of 
orange juice (Rogoff 1990). We have noted above that the child's 
observed use and experience of mental-state language can differ 
markedly across social contexts (Dunn 1996). Fractionation does 
not disappear entirely with development, either in general or in 
the specific case of reflectiveness. It is clearly possible for task-
based skills such as reflective function to come to be coordi­
nated, but this should not be seen as automatic. Unevenness 
across situations is likely to remain prevalent even in adults, 
especially when they are emotional (Fischer and Ayoub 1994). 
Normal development proceeds from fractionation toward inte­
gration, which involves the construction of specific coordinations 
among previously separate skills and provides the foundation for 
more complex, sophisticated control systems (Bidell and Fischer 
1994). Abnormalities of reflective function, the continued use of 
a teleological rather than a mentalizing model for predictive 
behavior, should not, then, be seen as either a consequence of 
"arrest and fixation" at an early stage or a "regression" to that 
stage. Pathologies in the reflective function of the maltreated 
child may be expected to develop increased complexity with age 
and time, in a manner similar to other skills. The skill for limited 
reflectiveness developed by the child to anticipate and forestall 
maltreatment and its painful physical and psychological impact 
would be adaptive in their particular world but would be ex­
pected to produce sophisticated forms of difficulty rather than 
straightforward adaptations in other contexts (Noam 1990). The 
ability to be reflective in general, but to show only minimal re­
flectiveness in the context of one's own childhood with reference 
to the mental states of "caregiving" others or in specific relation­
ships that reactivate the same schemata, could be a result of 
natural fractionation. Unevenness or splitting of reflective ability 
could also be the consequence of an active (purposeful, con-

more complex, sophisticated control systems (Bidell and Fischer 
1994). Abnormalities of reflective function, the continued use of 
a teleological rather than a mentalizing model for predictive 
behavior, should not, then, be seen as either a consequence of 
"arrest and fixation" at an early stage or a "regression" to that 
stage. Pathologies in the reflective function of the maltreated 
child may be expected to develop increased complexity with age 
and time, in a manner similar to other skills. The skill for limited 
reflectiveness developed by the child to anticipate and forestall 
maltreatment and its painful physical and psychological impact 
would be adaptive in their particular world but would be ex­
pected to produce sophisticated forms of difficulty rather than 
straightforward adaptations in other contexts (Noam 1990). The 
ability to be reflective in general, but to show only minimal re­
flectiveness in the context of one's own childhood with reference 
to the mental states of "caregiving" others or in specific relation­
ships that reactivate the same schemata, could be a result of 
natural fractionation. Unevenness or splitting of reflective ability 
could also be the consequence of an active (purposeful, con-

62 / Theoretical Perspectives 
scious, or unconscious) attempt on the part ofthe individual not 
to coordinate or generalize reflective function to specific relation­
ship domains. Here the unevenness is "a developmental achieve­
ment," in that the person must create a coordination in order 
actively to maintain the separation of contexts that would natu­
rally move toward integration. The family might, of course, sup­
port such splits with sharp dissociations between their public, 
proper world and their private tyrannical one. The split is con­
text-: and affect-dependent, and skills developed within one con­
text will not necessarily be matched by similar abilities in others. 
Within an attachment-theory framework we might say that the 
self is organized so that certain internal working models include 
considerable reflective components—expectations incorporating 
the mental states of self and other—while other working models 
of relationships appear impoverished, indicating only minimal 
mentalizing skills. In the latter contexts the subject will offer 
only stereotyped, simple, concrete, low-level descriptions. This 
does not imply developmental delay or regression; rather, it 
suggests a remarkably complex ability to coordinate two distinct 
levels of functioning. It is the function of the abusive or emotion­
ally depriving world within which they developed that engen­
dered in them the sophisticated skills required for such an 
adaptation. Thus to talk of deficit or absence of a capacity in 
such individuals would undoubtedly be an oversimplification. 
Measures of global abilities will not yield difference between 
these individuals and other groups. Efforts at going beyond mere 
clinical impression in terms of measurement and quantification 
have to take on .board the unevenness of their abilities and the 
situational and interpersonal specificity of the failure of reflec­
tive function. 
In our view, nonreflective internal working models come 
to dominate the behavior of personality-disordered adults and 
children when an element of conflict is present within an inter­
personal relationship. Conflict—or, rather, its adaptive resolu-
tion-^-prototypically calls for the perception both ofthe self and of 
the other in relation to the self, requiring individuals to reconcile 
their own legitimate claims with concern for the other (Killen and 
Nucci 1995). Thus, for example, the abnormality of the early 
family environment of individuals with severe problems of con-1 
Attachment and Reflective Function / 63 
duct has been most evident in the context of normally expectable 
conflicts (Patterson 1982; Perry, Perry, and Kennedy 1992). In 
this context the child with a vulnerable capacity for mentaliza­
tion experiences no affirmation of his intentional stance and fails 
to acquire the sense of ownership or inner endorsement of his 
actions that is essential for a sense of self-agency. Consequently, 
his sense of autonomy becomes vulnerable, and the importance 
of his original intention is exaggerated. The characteristics of 
oppositional defiant disorder (e.g., negativity, disobedience, ag­
gression) may in part be seen as attempts at reasserting self-
agency in a relationship where the connection between mental 
state and action within the self has been undermined by insensi­
tive and coercive parenting. ^ 
Abnormalities of parenting represent but one route to limita­
tions on reflective function. The child's biological vulnerabilities, 
such as hyperactivity, inadequate attentiveness, deficiencies in 
impulse control, are all likely to obstruct his opportunity for 
evolving a mentalized reflective model of conflictual interper­
sonal situations. Within a dialectic or transactional model there 
is a bidirectional causality inherent to such biological vulner­
abilities: they both provoke situations of conflict and gravely 
limit the child's capacity to handle them flexibly (see chapter 9). 
The separation of action from intention undermines the emo­
tional reaction individuals may be expected to have in relation to 
the consequences of their action, since, as Hart and Killen 
pointed out, the acquisition of moral emotions requires that 
individuals are "active contributors to their own development, 
interpreting their world and making judgments that determine 
their actions in it" (1995, p. 7). Subsequently, the predominant 
response to situations charged with emotion will be a nonreflec­
tive one, readily disowned by the self. Naturally the absence of 
reflective function in such situations will give the appearance of 
rigidity to the person's behavior, as if only a singular pattern of 
response were accessible. Furthermore, the response may fre­
quently be in conflict with social norms because the tendency to 
take the perspective of others has been abandoned in that con­
text, and consequently the "moral emotions" used to make 
judgments about the consequences of actions and to regulate 
behavior (Arsenio and Lover 1995) are absent. The absence of

reflective function may further exaggerate an antisocial response 
by forcing the individual to see the other not as another inten­

representing a social position or agency, or as an anonymous 
member of a group. 
Maltreatment, or more broadly trauma, is seen as interacting 
with the domain- and situation-specific restrictions on reflective 
function at two levels: (a) As we have argued, maltreatment 
presents the young child with a powerful emotional disincentive 
for taking the perspective of others because ofthe actual hostility 
ofthe intentional stance ofthe abuser, as well as the constraints 
upon self-development imposed by an older person's failure to 
understand and acknowledge the child's budding sense of inten-
tionality. (b) The child is deprived of the resilience provided by 
the capacity to understand a traumatic interpersonal situation 
(Fonagy et al. 1994). Thus individuals traumatized by their fam­
ily environment are vulnerable in terms both of the long-term 
maladaptive effect of their reaction to the trauma and of their 
reduced capacity to cope with it. The predominantly nonmen-
talizing stance adopted in such situations therefore further im­
pairs the individual and, in the extreme, their nonmentalizing 
approach will come to dominate all intimate interpersonal rela­
tionships. It is at this stage that severe developmental psychopa­
thology—ultimately entrenched personality disorder—becomes 
the likely outcome. Historical and Interdisciplinary

as inherently independent of, opposed to, and out of the control 
of rational thought. Certain neuroscientists have suggested that 
both traditions may have strong foundations in the brain struc­

INTRODUCTION 
There is an enormous and growing interest in affects across 
disciplines. Both in attachment theory and in many other do­
mains in psychology, one important component of this interest 
in affects centers on affect regulation. Yet, as many scholars 
have observed, the concept of affect regulation has never been 
well denned (Gross 1998, 1999; Magai 1999; R. Thompson 1990, 
1994). For some theorists, affect regulation, or what is some­
times referred to as "emotion regulation," denotes a process 
wherein the object of regulation is the affect/emotion itself 
(Eisenberg and Fabes 1992; N. Fox 1994; Garber and Dodge 
1991). For attachment theorists and psychoanalysts, however, 
the object of regulation is more complex: the regulation of affects 
is linked to the regulation of the self. More precisely, affect 
regulation plays a crucial part in the explanation of how infants 
move from a state of coregulation to self-regulation. The stakes 
are greater in the way psychoanalysts and attachment theorists 
conceive of affect regulation. 
Affects and affect regulation are not necessarily complemen­
tary concepts. Affect regulation entails the capacity to control 
and modulate our affective responses. However, we shall con­
sider some of the arguments of those who do not agree that 
affects can be brought under regulation. It is important, there­
fore, to begin this inquiry by taking a look at various sources and 
debates concerning the nature of affects and affect regulation. 
This historical background illuminates the way in which certain Affects and Affect Regulation / 67 
beliefs about affects continue to inform contemporary perspec­
tives. We begin, in the first part of this chapter, with philosophi­
cal perspectives on affects and affect regulation; we move on to 
psychological perspectives and then turn to neuroscientific 
perspectives. In the second part, we examine affects and affect 
regulation in psychoanalysis and then attachment theory. 
PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES 
In the Western philosophical tradition, the commitment to ra­
tionality as the ideal standard to guide action meant that affects 
were minimized in importance. At the same time, most major 
philosophers have felt the need to try to have some account of 
affects, and even philosophers who are staunch defenders of 
rationality, like Descartes, have had profound things to say 
about affects.1 We do not attempt to present a detailed inquiry 
about how affects have been understood in the history of phi­
losophy in this context. For our purposes, it will be sufficient to 
emphasize a crucial debate concerning the nature of affect 
within the history of philosophy that remains extremely relevant 
today for understanding affects and affect regulation. In chapter 
5, on the self as agent, we address contemporary ideas from the 
philosophy of mind in connection with the theme of intersubjec-
tivity. 
For Aristotle, affects are fundamental for the pursuit and 
attainment of a good and happy human life. He regards affects 
as beliefs; as such, they provide judgments about the world that 
can be justified or not. This means that, by themselves, affects 
are neither harmful nor opposed to reason. As Aristotle sees it, 
affects become harmful only insofar as our characters are too

and reason alone, guarantees knowledge. However, Descartes' treatise The Pas-
sions of the Soul is devoted to the treatment of affects, stressing the importance 
of the role of the body in affects. For an original perspective on just how seriously 
Descartes and other seventeenth-century philosophers took affects, see S. 
James 1997.

weak to counteract and moderate them.2 He does not deny that 
affects can become excessive; rather, he stresses that through 
practice we can learn to have them in the appropriate way—that 
is, at the right time, in the right way, and toward the right 
people. 
Aristotle is the first philosopher who, it is fair to surmise, 
postulated a theory of affect regulation. For him, regulating 
affects depends upon crafting them to occur within the interme­
diary course between the extremes of either excess or deficiency. 
In other words, we can distinguish between anger as conforming 
to the mean and its extremes—excess, which we can call irasci­
bility; and the deficiency, which we can call irritation (Barnes 
1984;. Rhetoric 1378a31).3 Aristotle wishes to urge us to cultivate 
our characters in order to be able to discern how to act in a way 
that places affects under our control. He appreciates the values 
of affects, and he particularly stresses how integrally connected 
pleasure is with affective experience (Gosling and Taylor 1982; 
Jurist 1998; Stocker and Hegeman 1996). Perhaps, most impor­
tantly, he fashions an ideal for human agents of integrating 
reason and feeling. 
Countering Aristotle, the Stoic philosophers challenge the 
notion that affects can be modulated. In their view, affects are 
beyond our control and necessarily elude cultivation; this ex­
plains why we often feel that affects happen to us, rather than 
that they are chosen by us. The Stoics regard affects as false 
judgments and hence as corrupting forces that lead us astray. 
It behooves us, therefore, to distance ourselves from affects and 
to strive to act on the basis of rationality alone. If we manage to 
withhold our consent to the overpowering force of affects, we can 
achieve the "detachment" and "self-sufficiency" by virtue of 
which we are able to flourish. 
"The Ancient Greek virtue, sophrosune, concerns the regulation of pleasure 
and bodily appetites. Sophrosune has to do with finding the right amount of 
pleasure, not restricting or devaluing it. 
3 Aristotle makes the point that it is difficult to find the, right word for the 
deficiency of anger, thereby acknowledging that anger is the kind of affect that is 
more likely to be excessive. Affects and Affect Regulation / 69 
The Stoic view has had a dominant influence on the history of 
philosophy. This is particularly striking in terms of the philo­
sophical propensity to construe irrationality strictly in terms of 
being a failure of rationality, rather than as having a meaning in 
its own right. Moreover, Stoic philosophy has had an important 
influence on early Christian thinking, wherein affects and the 
body are portrayed in negative terms. The ambivalence in Chris­
tianity toward affects is illustrated by DeSousa in that five out of 
the seven main vices are affects (pride, lust, envy, gluttony, 
anger, and sloth, but not avarice and greed), and three out ofthe 
four cardinal virtues concern resisting emotional temptations 
(prudence, fortitude, and temperance, but not justice) (1987, 
p. 17). Reflecting on the history of philosophy has more than 
antiquarian interest: the influence of the Stoic view has had real 
consequences for the self-understanding of our culture. 
Generally and somewhat bluntly stated, Aristotelians are 
friendly toward affects, whereas Stoics are wary of them.4 Al­
though these appear to be mutually exclusive paradigms, caution 
ought to be exercised not to reach such a conclusion prema­
turely. Indeed, in turning to Spinoza, we find a philosopher who 
accommodates different aspects of both paradigms. Spinoza was 
greatly influenced by the Cartesian revolution and was particu­
larly attracted to the aim of rendering philosophy more scientific, 
as is evident from the geometrical form of the Ethics (Spinoza, 
1677). He departed from Descartes' dualism, however, in conceiv­
ing of humans as embodied minds. Descartes' work, The Pas­
sions of the Soul, had the merit of portraying affects both- as 
sensations that are in the body and as mentalistic; in fact, the 
emphasis on affects and the body initiates an important new 
direction, which anticipates psychology, away from Aristotle's 
conception of them as beliefs. Yet a problem arises for Descartes 
in having to give an account of how the mind interacts with the 
body. Spinoza neatly bypasses this problem because he insists 
that bodily experience is directly accessible.to the mind (1677, 
p. 12).

see Nussbaum's The Therapy of Desire (1994).

ought to be exercised not to reach such a conclusion prema­
turely. Indeed, in turning to Spinoza, we find a philosopher who 
accommodates different aspects of both paradigms. Spinoza was 
greatly influenced by the Cartesian revolution and was particu­
larly attracted to the aim of rendering philosophy more scientific, 
as is evident from the geometrical form of the Ethics (Spinoza, 
1677). He departed from Descartes' dualism, however, in conceiv­
ing of humans as embodied minds. Descartes' work, The Pas­
sions of the Soul, had the merit of portraying affects both- as 
sensations that are in the body and as mentalistic; in fact, the 
emphasis on affects and the body initiates an important new 
direction, which anticipates psychology, away from Aristotle's 
conception of them as beliefs. Yet a problem arises for Descartes 
in having to give an account of how the mind interacts with the 
body. Spinoza neatly bypasses this problem because he insists 
that bodily experience is directly accessible.to the mind (1677, 
p. 12).

70 / Theoretical Perspectives 
Spinoza was strongly influenced by the Stoics' view of affects. 
He regards affects as false judgments and, hence, urges us to 
strive to resist acting upon them and to accept that they elude 
our control. Nonetheless, in Part III ofthe Ethics, Spinoza argues 
that we ought not simply to reject or forsake affects; rather, 
reason should be -used to correct affects without dismissing 
them. Our self-understanding is improved, according to Spinoza, 
by understanding our affects. From a clinical point of view, what 
is especially interesting about Spinoza is his suggestion that the 
affective state must be preserved in the way reason is applied to 
it. (We return to this idea later in the chapter.) In appreciating 
that affects enrich our lives, he exhibits sympathy for the Aristo­
telian hope of integrating feeling and reason. Thus, it is impos­
sible to place Spinoza neatly into either the Aristotelian or the 
Stoic camp. 
The debate between Aristotelians and Stoics haunts the his­
tory of thinking about affects. Can affects be cultivated? Do they 
give meaning to human life, and are they indispensable to the 
way we imagine human thriving? Or are they primitive forces 
that are dangerous to our well-being? One kind of philosophical 
approach to this debate is primarily to concentrate on those 
affects that one deems as valuable and as contributing to moral 
conduct. Hume takes such a position: he does not claim that all 
affects should be regarded as contributing to morality, but he 
maintains that morality is based upon feelings and could never 
be legislated by reason alone. More recently, moral psychologists 
in philosophy like Stocker and Hegeman (1996), Oakley (1992), 
Rorty and Flanagan (1990), Greenspan (1988), DeSousa (1987), 
and C. Taylor (1985) have argued' that affects contribute to 
morality and that it is mistaken to conceive of affects as under­
mining rationality. In sum, there is a growing appreciation by 
philosophers of the value of rethinking affects. This does not 
mean, of course, that there is agreement among philosophers. 
There remains a divide between those thinkers who wish to 
define affects in terms of beliefs (like Wollheim 1999) and others 
who want to reformulate the bodily contribution of affects who 
are captivated by the burgeoning scientific research on affects 
(e.g., Griffiths 1997). Affects and Affect Regulation / 71 
PSYCHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES 
In comparison to philosophy, the field of psychology has always 
exhibited a keen interest in phenomena besides reason, such as 
motivation. Nevertheless, during the era of behaviorism and even 
in the early phases of the cognitive revolution, affects have 
hardly been at the center of research in psychology. Tomkins 
(1995a, 1995b) stood as a relatively lone voice in American 
psychology during the 1950s and 1960s in working to develop 
Darwin's view that affects are revealed through facial expression* 
and are designed to lead us to action. Tomkins stressed that 
affects ought to be studied in their own right, and that they 
constitute an independent sphere of knowledge—distinct 
from perception, cognition, and memory. According to Tomkins, 
affects are primary biological motivating mechanisms and 
can, thus, be understood as having primacy in human agency. 
Tomkins's work highlights the link between affects and facial 
expressions, and, in his later writings, he included the impor­
tance of skin responses (Tomkins 1995b). 
Inspired by his teacher Tomkins, Ekman (1992a; Ekman and 
Davidson 1994) has, from the 1970s to the present, conducted 
research that demonstrates that emotions are universal and 
can be recognized cross-culturally through facial expressions.5 
Ekman argues that there are five "basic emotions"—happiness, 
sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. These basic emotions are 
defined in terms of the following nine characteristics: distinctive 
universal signals, presence in other primates, distinctive physi­
ology, distinctive universals in antecedent events, coherence 
among emotional response, quick onset, brief duration, auto­
matic appraisal, and unbidden occurrence (Ekman 1992a). 
Ekman concedes that the evidence supporting these nine char­
acteristics varies: evidence exists for distinctive patterns of auto­
nomic nervous system responses for anger, fear, disgust, and

feelings are subjective and particular (influenced by culture, family, and indi­
vidual idiosyncrasy). Affects are inclusive of both emotions and feelings.

(tentatively) sadness, and he claims that unique patterns exist 
for each emotion in the central nervous system. 
Like the Stoics, basic-emotions proponents emphasize that 
affects happen to us. It is the rapid onset of emotions, according 
to Ekman, that explains why we perceive them as happening to 
us, as opposed toperceiving ourselves to be choosing them. Yet, 
unlike the Stoics, basic-emotions proponents value affects as 
contributing to survival and at least in this sense regard them as 
salutary. The basic-emotions paradigm offers one possible path 
to conduct research about affects. There are other paradigms in 
psychology, growing out of the James-Lange theory (W. James 
1884; Lange 1885), which have been influential and which 
we need to consider. Before doing so, however, two criticisms 
against Ekman's work need to be acknowledged. 
The first criticism of basic emotions presses the question of 
whether affects form genuinely discrete categories or whether 
what is really "basic" about affects is their dimensions: levels of 
arousal, pleasure, and activity. For example, Davidson (1992) 
argues in favor of the dimensions of "approach and withdrawal" 
as basic, thus posing an explicit challenge to Ekman's under­
standing of basic emotions strictly in terms of facial expressions. 
Davidson rightly notes that nothing in Ekman's studies sustains 
the invariability of prototypical expressions—especially when 
these emotions occur spontaneously (as opposed to in the labo­
ratory). As Davidson adds, there is no compelling reason simply 
to assume that an isomorphic relationship exists between emo­
tions and their expressions—there may well be as much variabil­
ity within emotions as across them. 
The second criticism of Ekman's work concerns its cross-
cultural validity. J. Russell (1991) observes that while Ekman's 
work on facial expressions shows that emotions are similar 
across cultures, we should not assume that emotions are identi­
cal in different cultures. In a similar vein, Averill (1994) has 
emphasized that basic emotions are, in essence, a form of classi­
fication, and he warns that the adoption of such "prototypes" too 
often results in overlooking secondary and unusual emotions. 
Shweder, an anthropologist, develops an even more radical cri­
tique of the basic-emotions view. Shweder concurs that some Affects and Affect Regulation / 73 
emotions lack characteristic facial expressions and suggests that 
we ought to understand them as "complex narrative structures 
that give shape and meaning to somatic and affective experi­
ences" (1994, p. 37). Like Russell and Averill, Shweder rejects 
the basic-emotions view, regarding it as a construct of language 
that relies on appraisals of value rather than on anything that is 
found in nature. 
In raising questions about how beliefs can influence affects, 
the cross-cultural criticism draws our attention to the subjective 
experience of affects and implicitly to our potential to alter and 
craft them. Ekman makes it clear that he is primarily concerned 
with the innate and universal aspects of emotions; he avers that 
this is the path whereby research can make the most progress. 
Ekman specifically disavows the subjective experience of affects 
as unamenable to study "because too little is known about how 
subjectivity maps on to other aspects of an emotional experi­
ence" (1992a, p. 175). However, we may wonder to what extent 
the presentation of affective experience as found states within 
the mind is a distortion of its nature, which ignores our capacity 
to process and regulate affects. 
Many psychologists have focused attention on how cognition 
determines affective experience. Emerging as a response to the 
James-Lange theory, which stipulated that affects are the per­
ceptual recognition of physiological reactions to the outside 
world, Schachter and Singer (1962) argued that cognition is 
necessary in order to help us to label states of general physi­
ological arousal. This perspective shares with the basic-emotions 
view the fundamental basis of affective experience in the body; 
however, it differs from basic emotions on the issue of whether 
affects can be linked to distinctive physiological signs. More 
recently, Lazarus (1984, 1991, 1994) has stressed the cognitive 
contribution to affects by arguing that there is no such thing as 
affective experience without cognition. As he sees it, the startle 
response differs from the affect of fear precisely on the basis that 
cognition must accompany the latter. The primacy of cognition 
over affect was a cornerstone of the theoretical framework that 
organized the work of early cognitive behavioral therapists (see, 
for example, Beck 1967; Mahoney and Freeman 1985; Meichen-

the affect is, however, rejected by other psychologists like Zajonc 
(1984), who, in a widely read debate with Lazarus (1984), main­
tains that it Is possible to have affects without any accompany­
ing cognition. 
Much of the Zaj one-Lazarus debate hangs on the issue of 
what is implied by the term "cognition"—whether it is something 
fairly minimal, like awareness, or something fancier, closer to 
logical inference (e.g., Mandler 1984). If cognition indicates noth­
ing more than an accompanying awareness of the affect, it is less 
controversial than if it is supposed to denote logical thinking. 
The cognitive view of affects naturally shares an affinity with 
those who wish to emphasize the concept of affect regulation 
(Oatley and Johnson-Laird 1987; Power and Dalgleish 1997). 
Indeed, for a number of psychologists working on "emotion regu­
lation," the basic-emotions paradigm is not wrong as much as it 
is viewed as telling only part ofthe story about affects. However, 
not many of these psychologists have taken on the very difficult 
question of the knower who knows—that is, the nature of the 
subject who performs the cognitive evaluation that determines 
the nature of the affect. In seeking answers to some of the 
questions raised by philosophical and psychological perspec­
tives, it is helpful to turn to neuroscience. 
NEUROSCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES 
Neuroscience is>a new and exciting field for the study of affects. 
One researcher who has become prominent in the emerging 
subfield of "affective science" is LeDoux (1994a, 1994b, 1994c, 
1995, 1996). His work has dwelt on the emotion of fear in rats, 
which, he believes, is more or less similar across species, and he 
has drawn attention to the importance of the amygdala as the 
focal point in the brain that determines emotional significance. 
According to LeDoux, there are two emotional response systems 
in the brain: the first, which has its origin in the amygdala, is 
described as "quick and dirty" because it occurs automatically Affects and Affect Regulation / 75 
and is rather crude in nature; the second, which involves the 
neocortex, refines our capacity to respond by featuring a cogni­
tive component. 
LeDoux does not wish to locate emotion exclusively in these 
two separate parts ofthe brain. He is attentive to the interaction 
between the amygdala and the neocortex as well as to the crucial 
role of other parts, like the hippocampus. In his book The Emo­
tional Brain (LeDoux 1996), he emphasizes repeatedly that there 
is no single place in the brain where emotion resides. There are 
pathways from and to the neocortex in the amygdala, which 
can be activated by thalamic sensory processing (without going 
through the cortex) at the same time as the cortex is activated 
from the thalamus. The representation of objects occurs simul­
taneously, but distinctly from emotional response. As LeDoux 
puts it: "We can, in other words, begin to respond to the emo­
tional significance of a stimulus before we fully represent that 
stimulus" (1994a, p. 221). 
Emotional processing, thus, has an immediate and a mediate 
form—the former, while distinct, contributes to the latter. These 
two response systems are labeled "Type I and II" (LeDoux 1994a, 
1994b). Type I emotional responses are immediate and are a 
product of the evolutionary experience of the species; indeed, 
LeDoux likens them to fixed action patterns in animals. Basi­
cally, in Type I, emotions are automatic responses that occur 
from an initial, cursory evaluation; they are not under our 
voluntary control. Type II emotional responses, rather than be­
ing elicited, are emitted. They are specific to the individual, not 
the species, reflecting past experience and judgment about the 
applicability of the past to the current situation. In contrast to 
Type I responses, Type II responses are subject to our volitional 
control. 
LeDoux presses the distinction between older, more primitive 
emotional responses that have the function of being an "early 
warning system"—allowing us to ward off threatening stimuli, 
despite being somewhat limited in nature—and more recent and 
complex emotional responses that have differentiated functions; 
these more differentiated responses enjoy the benefit of percep­
tual completeness and are subject to our control. According to

these more differentiated responses enjoy the benefit of percep­
tual completeness and are subject to our control. According to 

76 / Theoretical Perspectives 
LeDoux, emotional responses can occur in the absence of cogni­
tive systems, since the neural circuits for emotion and cognition, 
while interactive, are distinct. 
Thus, LeDoux's view overlaps with the basic-emotions view, 
although it points the way to a richer account of affective experi­
ence by introducing Type II emotional responses, which are 
variable, flexible, and voluntary. LeDoux wishes to emphasize 
that much of emotional processing occurs outside our aware­
ness, and that in his judgment "feelings" emerge merely as a 
byproduct—"frills that have added icing to the emotional cake" 
(1996, p. 302). Like basic-emotions proponents, LeDoux mini­
mizes the subjective experience of affects, viewing it as a conse­
quence of behavioral adaptation that has been preserved 
through evolution, rather than having to do with the "primary 
business" of affects (LeDoux, 1994c).6 As a behaviorist and socio-
biologist, LeDoux is wary of and refrains from exploring self-
reflection. Although he affirms that affects occur unconsciously, 
he dismisses the psychoanalytic unconscious as "a darker, more 
malevolent place" (1996, pp. 29-30). 
The two-systems view of emotional response described by 
LeDoux is valuable for mitigating the tension between the Aristo­
telian and Stoic paradigms. At the risk of oversimplification, we 
can say that the first system of emotional response captures the 
Stoic position that affects happen to us and elude our control. 
The second system of emotional response described by LeDoux 
helps to clarify that the first system is not the only one and that, 
as Aristotelians have emphasized, we need to pay attention to 
our capacity to craft affects once they occur. 
LeDoux is aware that his evolutionary account of affects is 
only a starting point. He casually notes, for example, that Type II 
emotional responses depend on the existence of some kind 
of self-organization. Without elaborating, LeDoux observes that 
"the capacity to have feelings is directly tied to the capacity to be 
consciously aware of one's self and the relation of oneself to the 
6 Not all neuroscientists would agree with LeDoux on this point; in fact, 
Panksepp has criticized LeDoux for minimizing the importance of emotional 
feelings (Panksepp 1998, p. 341). Affects and Affect Regulation / 77 
rest ofthe world" (1996, p. 125). This statement tacitly acknowl­
edges the need to broaden the basic-emotions approach in the 
direction of affect regulation. In invoking the self, LeDoux is on 
the verge of opening a door that he opts not to enter. 
Other neuroscientists, like Panksepp and Damasio, have 
taken up the challenge of addressing the relation of affects and 
the self. For reasons of space, we will concentrate on Damasio's

Damasio's neurological research concerns patients with prefron­
tal brain damage who exhibit an apparent inability to feel, al­
though they are able to reactivate past events into working 
memory. In contrast to the. narrow focus of LeDoux's animal 
research, which admonishes us to look at very specific functions 
in our approach to the relationship between emotion and cogni­
tion, Damasio welcomes large philosophical questions. 
As the title of his first book, Descartes' Error (Damasio 1994a), 
suggests, Damasio wants to reject mind-body dualism and espe­
cially the assumption made by philosophers who wish to affirm 
rationality by rejecting affects. Damasio's argument is that, from 
the neural perspective, emotions are constitutive of rationality 
itself. As he observes: "Nature appears to have built the appara­
tus of rationality not just on top of the apparatus for biological 
regulation, but also from and with it" (p. 128). Rationality is 
shaped by and modulated by body signals; thus, the body pro­
vides content to the mind, not just life support in being aware of 
the condition ofthe visceral and musculoskeletal state (p. 160). 
Damasio's claim is not merely .that the body and emotions con­
tribute to rationality; he wants to go further and suggest that the 
reduction of emotion, evident in his brain-injured patients, se­
verely impinges upon the capacity to reason. 
Damasio's main thesis is that there is interconnection be­
tween cognition and emotion within the brain system, such that 
"Panksepp argues that affective states provide essential scaffolding for all 
other forms of consciousness; he suggests that the self has its source in the self-
representation that comes from primitive motor representation within the 
brainstem (Panksepp 1998, p. 309). 

76 / Theoretical Perspectives 
LeDoux, emotional responses can occur in the absence of cogni­
tive systems, since the neural circuits for emotion and cognition, 
while interactive, are distinct. 
Thus, LeDoux's view overlaps with the basic-emotions view, 
although it points the way to a richer account of affective experi­
ence by introducing Type II emotional responses, which are 
variable, flexible, and voluntary. LeDoux wishes to emphasize 
that much of emotional processing occurs outside our aware­
ness, and that in his judgment "feelings" emerge merely as a 
byproduct—"frills that have added icing to the emotional cake" 
(1996, p. 302). Like basic-emotions proponents, LeDoux mini­
mizes the subjective experience of affects, viewing it as a conse­
quence of behavioral adaptation that has been preserved 
through evolution, rather than having to do with the "primary 
business" of affects (LeDoux, 1994c).6 As a behaviorist and socio-
biologist, LeDoux is wary of and refrains from exploring self-
reflection. Although he affirms that affects occur unconsciously, 
he dismisses the psychoanalytic unconscious as "a darker, more 
malevolent place" (1996, pp. 29-30). 
The two-systems view of emotional response described by 
LeDoux is valuable for mitigating the tension between the Aristo­
telian and Stoic paradigms. At the risk of oversimplification, we 
can say that the first system of emotional response captures the 
Stoic position that affects happen to us and elude our control. 
The second system of emotional response described by LeDoux 
helps to clarify that the first system is not the only one and that, 
as Aristotelians have emphasized, we need to pay attention to 
our capacity to craft affects once they occur. 
LeDoux is aware that his evolutionary account of affects is 
only a starting point. He casually notes, for example, that Type II 
emotional responses depend on the existence of some kind 
of self-organization. Without elaborating, LeDoux observes that 
"the capacity to have feelings is directly tied to the capacity to be 
consciously aware of one's self and the relation of oneself to the 
6 Not all neuroscientists would agree with LeDoux on this point; in fact, 
Panksepp has criticized LeDoux for minimizing the importance of emotional 
feelings (Panksepp 1998, p. 341). Affects and Affect Regulation / 77 
rest ofthe world" (1996, p. 125). This statement tacitly acknowl­
edges the need to broaden the basic-emotions approach in the 
direction of affect regulation. In invoking the self, LeDoux is on 
the verge of opening a door that he opts not to enter. 
Other neuroscientists, like Panksepp and Damasio, have 
taken up the challenge of addressing the relation of affects and 
the self. For reasons of space, we will concentrate on Damasio's 
work, although this is not meant to minimize the contribution of 
Panksepp's Affective Neuroscience (Panksepp 1998) to the field.7

it is artificial to insist on the difference between them. This 
stress on interconnection might seem to imply that Damasio's 
position departs from those—like Tomkins, Ekman, Zajonc, and 
LeDoux—who assert the primacy of affects.8 However, while 
Damasio highlights the interaction between emotion and cogni­
tion, he would not deny that emotions can exist without cogni­
tion- He endorses a multiple-systems approach to emotions. 
In order to clarify the originality of Damasio's view, we need to 
explore it in more detail. He introduces his own distinction 
between primary and secondary emotions, where the latter come 
from acquired rather than innate dispositional representations. 
Secondary emotions utilize primary emotions, but they also give 
rise to "feelings''—a technical term that characterizes the experi­
ence of changes in the body landscape reflected in the mental 
images thereby invoked (1994a, p. 145). Damasio ponders why it 
is that feelings arise, as merely accounting for neurochemical 
changes or the notion that they are neural representations ofthe 
body landscape at the moment seems insufficient. He concludes 
that we need to understand the many levels of neural circuitry in 
the body, all of which enable rationality and give rise to the self 
(pp. 147, 161). 
Damasio elucidates the neural basis of the self by probing 
how emotions are integrated in rationality itself—which he terms 
the "somatic marker hypothesis." The somatic marker hypoth­
esis shows that our decision-making process incorporates gut-
level responses that are, in fact, automatic signals from the body 
that protect and help us to limit and choose among possible 
options. Somatic markers—part ofthe neural system located in 
the prefrontal cortices—are "a special instance of feelings gener­
ated from secondary emotions . . . connected, by learning, to 
predicted future outcomes of certain scenarios" (1994a, p. 174). 
But they also serve as a prelude to more abstract decision-

cites LeDoux's work on the importance of the amygdala for emotional experi­
ence. Both concur that emotions have been given short shrift among cognitive 
scientists. More significantly, Damasio. like LeDoux, believes that there are two 
systems of emotions, one subcortical and the other neocortical—which he delin­
eates in terms of primary and secondary emotions. Damasio is also influenced 
by Edelman's (1992) distinction between primary and secondary consciousness. Affects and Affect Regulation / 79

an "as-if manner—without outside stimulation and coming to 
our awareness. They help us to anticipate outcomes and make 
new goals, negotiating the future by means of the perception of 
pleasure and pain landscapes. 
For Damasio, the self is implied in a neural account of emo­
tion and especially feelings. He readily acknowledges that this is 
a biological state that repeatedly recreates itself—a mental con­
struction. Nevertheless, he wishes to affirm our sense of experi­
encing an ongoing and continuous biological state—of which 
we feel like "an owner and knower for most, though not all, 
contents" (1994a, p. 238). He seeks to do so without sounding 
anachronistic—that is, mistakenly conjuring "a little person, the 
infamous homunculus, inside your brain contemplating what is 
going on" (p. 227). 
The concept of the neural basis of a self requires early sensory 
cortices, sensory and motor cortical associations regions, and 
subcortical nuclei. As Damasio sees it, the neural self does not 
depend on the function of language, although language does 
enable, a more refined form of subjectivity by means of the 
creation of verbal narratives out of nonverbal ones. As he formu­
lates this: "Language may not be the source of the self, but it 
certainly is the source of the T" (1994a, p. 243). Damasio does 
not explore this suggestive distinction between the self and the I 
and, in fact, has little to say in his book about what it means to 
be an "I." We are left to wonder how the neural self is related to 
what we might refer to as the phenomenological self. Damasio 
also fails to contend with the influence of the factor of culture in 
this regard; nor does he discuss human development. 
In his recent book, The Feeling of What Happens, Damasio 
(1999) elucidates his earlier work, most importantly by differenti­
ating between three distinct senses of self: the "proto-self," the 
"core self," and the "autobiographical self." The proto-self is 
based on "the ensemble of brain devices that continuously and 
nonconsciously maintain the body state within the narrow range 
and relative stability required for survival" (p. 22). The second 
self, the core self, enables us to be concerned with the experience 
of the here and now. Core consciousness, on which the core self 
is based, emerges when "the brain's representation devices gen-

state is affected by the organism's processing of an object, and 
when this process enhances the image of the causative object, 
thus placing it saliently in a spatial and temporal context" (p. 
169). Damasio stresses the link between the core self and emo­
tions; a reliable correlate of a defective core consciousness, he 
informs us, is the absence of emotions (p. 100). 
The autobiographical self is produced by a more complex 
kind of consciousness, "extended consciousness." Extended con­
sciousness provides us with an identity and sense of personhood; 
it makes us aware of being at a point in individual historical time, 
aware of having both a lived past and an anticipated future. The 
autobiographical self is predicated on an organized record from 
reconstructed images of the organism's unique history. Working 
memory is crucial for the autobiographical self in a way in which 
it is not for the core self. The autobiographical self, while relying 
on the core self, adds the dimensions of past and future. Accord­
ing to Damasio, the core self is the foundation of consciousness, 
and the autobiographical self is its glory (1999, p. 195). In pass­
ing, Damasio observes that the sense of self that has preoccupied 
developmental psychologists, occurring at about the age of 18 
months, is the autobiographical self. He does not attempt to 
address in any further detail the issue of how the self develops. 
Our work attempts to fill in these stages and mechanisms, 
thereby underscoring the importance of a developmental per­
spective to understanding the self. 
There are a number of key points to articulate about neuro­
science before moving on to discuss affects and affect regulation 
in psychoanalysis and attachment theory. As we have seen, 
LeDoux's proposal of two emotional-response systems in the 
brain helps to reconceptualize the long-standing and seemingly 
unreconcilable contrast between Aristotelians and Stoics on af­
fects: the first system confirms the Stoic belief that emotional 
responses are beyond our control; the second system supports 
the Aristotelian idea that emotional responses can be regulated. 
LeDoux's proposal also offers a potential resolution of the de­
bate, briefly mentioned above, between the psychologists Zajonc 
and Lazarus: the first system illustrates how affects can occur 
without cognition, as the former argues, and the second system Affects and Affect Regulation / 81 
shows how affects are influenced by cognition, as the latter 
argues. LeDoux's view highlights the complexity and range of 
affective experience: it endorses the basic-emotions view, while 
offering a more fruitful overall account. Yet in invoking the self 
without building this into his theory, LeDoux provides a compel­
ling reason to produce such an account. Like other psychological 
perspectives, LeDoux's rests content with the description of cog­
nition acting upon affects. 
Damasio has undertaken an ambitious project of highlighting 
the interrelated areas of affects, the self, and the brain. His view 
is sensitive to the interaction between cognition and affects, 
especially the way in which affects can contribute positively 
to cognition (as Hume and contemporary philosophers have 
argued). Damasio develops the notion that affects help to create 
and sustain the self in an original way. He does not attempt to 
grapple with the issue of how the self develops—which we shall 
do later in this book. More specifically, in chapter 5, we focus on 
the theme of intersubjectivity, concurring with Damasio that 
aspects of the self do not depend on it, but then moving on to 
pinpoint its crucial role in the development of the self. 
In conclusion, the neuroscientific accounts of LeDoux and 
Damasio deepen the Spinozistic insight that we are embodied 
minds. At the same time, they take us beyond most of the 
philosophical perspectives on affects as either physical or mental 
(or some combination of both). Neuroscience offers an account of 
affects that is indispensable, however much more there is to 
clarify. It would be foolhardy to imagine that all of the problems 
concerning affects have been or could be dissolved by neuro­
science. No doubt, we are still at a relatively early stage of 
understanding the relation between affects and the brain. We 
have learned enough, however, to make it impossible for any 
perspective on affects, including psychoanalysis or attachment 
theory, to ignore neuroscience. Such a stance does not betoken 
reductionism. As we shall suggest, the subtle and sophisticated 
attention paid by developmental theory to the subjective expe­
rience of affects and affect regulation has much to offer the 
neuroscientific as well as other perspectives. 
With the background of philosophical, psychological, and 
neuroscientific perspectives in mind, let us now turn to focus on

82 / Theoretical Perspectives 
psychoanalytic and attachment perspectives on affects and af­

trate on development as well as the subjective experience of 
affects. After examining psychoanalytic and attachment perspec­
tives, the final section offers an integration of all of the perspec­
tives that have been considered. 
PSYCHOANALYTIC PERSPECTIVES 
It has become almost commonplace for psychoanalysts to be­
moan the lack of an adequate theory of affects. No one could 
dispute that affects have occupied an awkward place in psycho­
analysis, and that they deserve much closer scrutiny. At the very 
least, it can be observed that a large disparity exists between the 
marginal role accorded to affects in the theory of psychoanalysis 
and their enormous importance in the clinical realm. To under­
stand why affects are only now becoming central in psychoana­
lytic thinking, we must begin with Freud. 
As is well known, Freud .never treated affects in their own 
right, and he modified his views several times, usually without 
trying to reconcile his new views with previous ones. Moreover, 
Freud never addressed the question of how affects could be 
closely tied to drives on the one hand, and yet be so omnipresent 
and crucial to what occurs in the interaction between analyst 
and patient in the clinical setting on the other. Nevertheless, 
Freud does offer numerous richly nuanced descriptions of af­
fects—especially in some of his writing on aesthetics—even if 
they are not the centerpiece of any of his works. 
There are two main competing tendencies in the way Freud 
portrays affects, and these two tendencies have dominated the 
history of psychoanalysis. According to the first tendency, affects 
discharge energy and must be comprehended as the psychic 
manifestation- (along with ideas) of drives. Closely connected to 
this tendency is that, ultimately, affects have their source be­
yond the realm of consciousness—in the id. In his earliest writ­
ings, Freud developed the view that affects discharge energy; he 
then modified it in the metapsychological papers, in particular Affects and Affect Regulation / 83 
the essay "The Unconscious" (Freud 1915e), in order to affirm 
the relation between drives and affects (and also to move away 
from the implication that affects have a merely pathological 
function).9 Of course, the shift to the view that affects are the 
manifestations of drives left Freud to struggle against the per­
plexing notion that affects must be conscious, whereas drives 
are unconscious.10 Although Freud's view evolved, the overall 
direction of the first tendency is to affirm that affects are power­
ful, elemental biological forces. 
According to the second tendency, affects are signals and are 
subject—at least to some degree—to the control of the ego. This 
certainly carries the implication that affects are regarded as 
contributing to adaptive functioning. The second tendency, 
which has its source in Freud's Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxi­
ety (Freud 1926d [1925]), has been extended further with the 
introduction of the language of the self and the concept of affect 
regulation in psychoanalysis. It is fair to say that through the 
influence of object-relations theory and particularly developmen­
tal theory, the second tendency has flourished in recent years. 
Nonetheless, there are some psychoanalytic thinkers, like 
Andre Green, who wish to question the emergence of the second 
tendency, arguing that only the first tendency represents a 
uniquely psychoanalytic view. Green (1999) suggests that plac­
ing too much importance on the regulatory control of ego ob­
scures the power of the unconscious to generate affects. He also 
worries about the diluting effect on psychoanalysis of importing 
ideas from biology and/or developmental theory (Green 1999). In 
our view, though, the assumption that a choice must be made 
between the first and second tendency is questionable. Both are 
important in psychoanalysis. 
Although our interests are mainly consistent with the second 
tendency, we do not think that this entails any slight to the first 
one. It is incumbent, though, upon anyone who wishes to develop 
the first tendency to reformulate Freud's ideas within the frame-
9There are good accounts of the development of Freud's view of affects in 
Green (1999), R. Stein (1990). and Rapaport (1953). 
l0Pulver (1971) grapples with this issue and concludes that affects can be 
unconscious.

Freud does offer numerous richly nuanced descriptions of af­
fects—especially in some of his writing on aesthetics—even if 
they are not the centerpiece of any of his works. 
There are two main competing tendencies in the way Freud 
portrays affects, and these two tendencies have dominated the 
history of psychoanalysis. According to the first tendency, affects 
discharge energy and must be comprehended as the psychic 
manifestation- (along with ideas) of drives. Closely connected to 
this tendency is that, ultimately, affects have their source be­
yond the realm of consciousness—in the id. In his earliest writ­
ings, Freud developed the view that affects discharge energy; he 
then modified it in the metapsychological papers, in particular Affects and Affect Regulation / 83 
the essay "The Unconscious" (Freud 1915e), in order to affirm 
the relation between drives and affects (and also to move away 
from the implication that affects have a merely pathological 
function).9 Of course, the shift to the view that affects are the 
manifestations of drives left Freud to struggle against the per­
plexing notion that affects must be conscious, whereas drives 
are unconscious.10 Although Freud's view evolved, the overall 
direction of the first tendency is to affirm that affects are power­
ful, elemental biological forces. 
According to the second tendency, affects are signals and are 
subject—at least to some degree—to the control of the ego. This 
certainly carries the implication that affects are regarded as 
contributing to adaptive functioning. The second tendency, 
which has its source in Freud's Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxi­
ety (Freud 1926d [1925]), has been extended further with the 
introduction of the language of the self and the concept of affect 
regulation in psychoanalysis. It is fair to say that through the 
influence of object-relations theory and particularly developmen­
tal theory, the second tendency has flourished in recent years. 
Nonetheless, there are some psychoanalytic thinkers, like 
Andre Green, who wish to question the emergence of the second 
tendency, arguing that only the first tendency represents a 
uniquely psychoanalytic view. Green (1999) suggests that plac­
ing too much importance on the regulatory control of ego ob­
scures the power of the unconscious to generate affects. He also 
worries about the diluting effect on psychoanalysis of importing 
ideas from biology and/or developmental theory (Green 1999). In 
our view, though, the assumption that a choice must be made 
between the first and second tendency is questionable. Both are 
important in psychoanalysis. 
Although our interests are mainly consistent with the second 
tendency, we do not think that this entails any slight to the first 
one. It is incumbent, though, upon anyone who wishes to develop 
the first tendency to reformulate Freud's ideas within the frame-
9There are good accounts of the development of Freud's view of affects in 
Green (1999), R. Stein (1990). and Rapaport (1953). 
l0Pulver (1971) grapples with this issue and concludes that affects can be 
unconscious.

work of current scientific knowledge. Consider, for example, 
Green's defense of the first tendency, which stresses how affects 
are particularly oriented toward the inside of the body (1999, 
p. 163). This directly follows Freud's belief that the affect "mani­
fests itself essentially in motor (secretory, circulatory) changes of 
the subject's own body without reference to the outside world" 
(Freud, 1915e, p. 179). On the face of it, such a view seems to 
contradict the psychological and neuroscientific views that we 
have encountered, which explain affects in terms of responses to 
the world. It is also relevant in this connection that developmen­
tal research has shown that infants are turned outward to the 
world from the time of birth in a way that departs from the 
assumptions of classical psychoanalysis. (Research on this topic 
is discussed in chapters 4 and 5 on infant development). 
Does this mean that we must conclude that Freud's intuitions 
about affects are wrong? Not necessarily. It is possible to qualify 
what he means by appealing to Damasio's discussion of the 
"internal milieu" and his "somatic marker hypothesis," wherein 
the brain constantly monitors what is occurring in the body, as a 
way to understand the internal experience of affects. Although 
this might help us characterize the sense in which affects are 
internal, it would still not be a negation ofthe idea that they are 
stimulated externally. Interestingly enough, one of the earliest 
psychoanalytic thinkers on affects, Brierley (1937), specifically 
addresses this point, urging psychoanalysts to appreciate that 
affects can be either internal or external. 
As a general point, it is worth stressing that psychoanalysis 
has much to gain from opening itself up to define and develop 
itself with reference to views from other, related fields. It is our 
impression that psychoanalysis has suffered from being isolated 
from other perspectives on the subject of affects. As is already 
apparent, many ofthe issues about affects that have been raised 
within psychoanalysis echo debates from historical and other 
perspectives. 
For Freud, affects have both physical and mental aspects. 
They occur within the body, but they have psychic significance. 
Like Spinoza, Freud defined the mind as embodied, and he 
articulated the nature of psychic experience in such a way as to 
avoid the pitfalls of Cartesian dualism. Freud's approach to the Affects and Affect Regulation / 85 
study of affects seeks to affirm biology without forsaking subjec­
tive experience. Although many questions remain unresolved 
about what this really means, it constitutes a distinctive and 
fruitful approach to the subject. For instance, one might raise 
the question of whether the body is a necessary component of all 
affective experience—or is affect experience possible without it? 
Freud clearly appreciated the biological basis of affects and saw 
them as contributing to survival. However, Freud also ascribed a 
mental function to affects—for example, that along with ideas, 
they are the manifestations of drives. He implied that affects play 
a role in how we interpret and find meaning in the world, 
although he never ventured to explore this point explicitly. 
Let us take a step further in formulating how psychoanalysis 
follows and yet can be distinguished from other points of view on 
affects. Insofar as Freud links affects to discharge and the mani­
festation of drives, we may discern the Stoic orientation: affects 
are strong and dangerous forces that are not subject to our 
conscious control. But insofar as Freud sees affects as signals 
that are subject to the mediation of the ego, an Aristotelian 
orientation is also present. Freud's special emphasis on the 
single affect of anxiety marks his view as quite different from 
Aristotle. Yet he is certainly not as suspicious of affects as the 
Stoics were. Indeed, a psychoanalytic approach to the mind is 
often read as challenging the hegemony of reason that defines 
the Western philosophical tradition.11 
Some psychoanalysts, like Emde (1983) and Gaensbauer 
(1982), explicitly register their agreement with the basic-emo­
tions view. The position of psychoanalysis in relation to basic 
emotions remains open to question, however. One might note 
that psychoanalysis is naturally allied with the dimensions criti­
cism of basic emotions, given its commitment to pleasure and 
unpleasure as basic. One might argue, alternatively, that pleas­
ure and unpleasure are transformed into basic emotions—a 
point of view that is in the spirit of Jacobson (1953). In this 
connection, too, it is worth noting that there are a number of 
psychoanalysts who have become interested in neuroscientific

choanalysis with the philosophical tradition.

views of affects (Kaplan-Solms and Solms 2000; Schore 1993, 
1999). 
Freud construes anxiety in a way that expands the meaning of 
this affect. In one sense, it is almost as if he conceives of it as 
akin to a general state of physiological arousal. In another sense, 
he chooses to dwell upon this one affect because of its clinical 
prominence. The concern with anxiety is problematic in that it 
lends credence to the notion that Freud was, from the time of his 
original understanding of affects as discharges of energy to his 
later point of view, preoccupied with negative affect. Indeed, 
Jacobson (1953) was the first analyst squarely to confront the 
fact that attention to the salutary dimension of affective experi­
ence was missing from Freud's theoretical account. Nowhere 
does Freud grapple with the Aristotelian appreciation for how 
affect regulation is crucial, not just for survival, but for well-
being. This, is all the more curious in light of the strong interest 
that Freud developed in the affective bond between analyst and 
patient. 
Damasio's work is particularly relevant to psychoanalysis for 
a number of reasons, such as his interest in the neurobiological 
basis of the self, especially his emphasis on the relation between 
affects and the self (which coincides with the second tendency in 
psychoanalysis). Moreover, Damasio's work supports the idea 
that we need not choose between what we have described as the 
first and second tendencies in psychoanalytic conceptions of 
affects. Damasio's concerns range from the neurobiology of 
moment-to-moment internal, homeostatic regulation to the so­
phisticated integration of the past, present, and future autobio­
graphical self. Underlying his understanding of regulation is 
biology. Damasio persuasively draws our attention to the com­
plexity of the notion of regulation by demonstrating how regula­
tory processes are not necessarily subject to the ego or self. 
In the final section of this chapter, we focus in greater depth 
on the meanings ofthe term "regulation." For now, let us observe 
that a psychoanalytic approach to regulation highlights the on­
going struggle that it entails. Once achieved, regulation is not 
automatically maintained. Characteristically, it is lost and re­
gained even for the most capable people. While it belongs to the Affects and Affect Regulation / 87 
nature of a self to modulate affective experience, this is not 
simply a matter of applying cognition to name and determine the 
nature of a single affect. Understanding regulation means heed­
ing the subtleties of subjective experience. More specifically, it" 
means grappling with the elusiveness of our affects and the 
difficulty of understanding their meaning. Clinical experience 
makes it abundantly evident that we do not always know how we 
feel. We are often deceived about our affects, believing that we 
feel one thing, when in fact it turns out that we feel something 
else. Moreover, we can and often do feel different things at the 
same time. 
Psychoanalysts have ample experience with the subjective 
experience of affects. This does not mean that a theory of affects 
must be clinically based, as some have maintained (Westen 
1997). It does suggest that the basic-emotions paradigm, how­
ever necessary, will not be sufficient. Psychoanalysts are 
comfortable with how unobvious and complicated affective expe­
rience can be. Yet the aim of psychoanalytic treatment in all 
cases must include the facilitation and maintenance of affect 
regulation. It is impossible, we think, to imagine psychoanalysis 
as not addressing itself to one's relation to one's own affects. 
Regulation goes to the very heart of change that is producedby 
psychoanalysis. 
ATTACHMENT THEORY PERSPECTIVES 
It is somewhat ironic that in the literature on attachment affects 
are so fundamental that questions about what they actually are 
have been overlooked. Affects are crucial to attachment theory 
because the attachment relationship between infant and care­
giver is itself an affective bond. Affect regulation has enjoyed, 
prominence in attachment theory and research; in fact, the 
focus on this concept can be used as a partial explanation of why 
affects themselves have not garnered more specific attention. 
However, this explanation only goes so far. It does not satisfac-

torily explain, for example, how little Bowlby concerned himself 
with affect and motivation in general. Bowlby defined attach­
ment in terms of an "affectional" bond without explicating what 
he meant by this term. His comments on emotions, while high­
lighting their importance for attachment, are not particularly 
insightful. For example, Bowlby asserts that 
Many-of the most intense emotions arise during the formation, 
the maintenance, the disruption and the renewal of attachment 
relationships. The formation of a bond is described as falling in 
love, maintaining a bond as loving someone, and losing a part­
ner as grieving over someone. Similarly, threat of loss arouses 
anxiety and actual loss gives rise to sorrow; while each of these 
situations is likely to arouse anger. The unchallenged mainte­
nance of a bond is experienced as a source of security and the 
renewal of a bond as a source of joy. [1980, p. 40] 
His interesting idea that fear is an inevitable response to certain 
innately encoded stimuli—such as novelty, suddenness—that 
triggers the attachment system, whereas anxiety is the same 
affective response once the attachment system has been trig­
gered but not responded to adequately by the caregiver, is not 
strongly supported by research. There is no indication that 
Bowlby fully appreciated how affect regulation ensues from at­
tachment. Happily, the tendency in recent attachment work is to 
pay more attention to affects in relation to affect regulation, and 
so we turn now to examine this development. 
In attachment theory, the regulation of affects serves to foster 
the emergence of self-regulation from coregulation. Or, put into 
the alternative language that Sroufe uses, this means that 
the regulatory system of the infant is transformed from being 
"dyadic" to being "individual." Sroufe's focus is on the role of 
emotions in development. He observes that Bowlby did not 
adequately conceptualize affects, and therefore he undertakes 
this task (Sroufe 1996, p. 177). He maintains that emotions 
arise during the second half of the first year of life. To some 
extent, this offers a challenge to the basic-emotions position. 
Sroufe specifically rejects the view put forth by Izard that infants 
are born with basic emotions, stressing instead that such emo-Affects and Affect Regulation / 89 
tions come into being through the input of a caregiver. Sroufe's 
point is that emotions exist from birth only in a precursor form; 
a shift then occurs during the second half-year of life whereby 
emotions become more differentiated and less global. Emotions 
are thereby experienced subjectively and are imbued with mean­
ing in a new sense. As Sroufe claims, during the second half of 
the first year, "regulation of arousal and emotion no longer 
depend simply on what the caregiver does, but on how the infant 
interprets the caregiver's accessibility and behavior" (p. 170). 
Sroufe grounds his notion of affect regulation in the capacity 
to maintain organization in the face of tension. He is careful to 
emphasize that this is not a matter of cognition influencing 
affects. Sroufe makes the proposal that the regulation of affects 
ought to be seen as an "Anlage" or prototype of self-regulation. 
Self-regulation is understood as part of a nexus that includes 
self-reliance and self-esteem. Sroufe traces the movement of how 
"confidence in the caregiver becomes confidence in the self with 
the caregiver and, ultimately, confidence in the self (1996, 
p. 186). Although Sroufe would seem to be receptive to postulat­
ing intrapsychic structures that are produced by attachment— 
given that he was responsible for the shift away from Bowlby's 
notion that the goal of attachment is proximity to the caregiver to 
the goal of "felt security" (Sroufe and Waters 1977a)—he does not 
attempt to articulate what underlies the idea of self-confidence. 
Another attachment theorist whose work has focused on the 
role of affects is Magai (1999). (For her earlier work on this topic, 
published under the name Malatesta, see Malatesta, Culver, 
Tesman, and Shepard 1989.) Like Sroufe, Magai acknowledges 
that Bowlby did not pay much attention to affects themselves. 
Nevertheless, she points out some similarities between Bowlby 
and Tomkins, who developed their respective views at around 
the same time. Although Magai is more sympathetic than Sroufe 
to the basic-emotions position, her special interest lies in how 
parental affective style influences the capacity for regulation. 
A key aspect of Magai's work is drawn from Cassidy, who 
proposes a connection between styles of attachment and regula­
tion. Yet, to her credit, Magai cautiously resists the supposition 
that emotional traits/dispositions completely overlap with at­
tachment style.

90 / Theoretical Perspectives 
According to Cassidy, affect regulation can be linked to the 
quality of attachment (1994, p. 247). The anxious/avoidant style 
of attachment tends to minimize affects and thus can be under­
stood in terms of the overregulation of affect; the anxious/ 
ambivalent style tends to heighten affects and thus can be 
understood in terms of the underregulation of affect. The secure 
style of attachment manifests an open and flexible kind of regu­
lation. More specifically, Cassidy maintains that in anxious/ 
avoidant attachment, the aversion to negative affect means that 
negative affect is not expressed, but not that it is not felt. 
In anxious/ambivalent attachment, it is unclear whether the 
greater responsiveness to negative affect means that it is ex­
pressed to a degree beyond how it is actually felt. Cassidy's work 
offers a promising way to think about affective experience 
for attachment theory and has been developed further by Slade 
(1999), who suggests how problems in dysregulation can be tied 
to various types of pathology. 
As attachment theory has evolved, so the concept of affect 
regulation has become increasingly central. Interest in affects 
themselves has been slower to evolve and is still in the process of 
developing. There is clearly an Aristotelian bias in attachment 
thinking about affects—they are, by nature, understood to be 
subject to modulation. There is not much evidence that attach­
ment theorists give much credence to the Stoic orientation to 
affects. Indeed, attachment theorists have not contended with 
the first system of emotional response as depicted by LeDoux 
and supported by Damasio. Hofer's (1984, 1990; Polan and Hofer 
1999) work with rat pups and mothers comes closest to doing so, 
as it offers an account of regulation through attachment that 
emphasizes hidden dimensions that are not subject to conscious 
control. Hofer warns us, in fact, that regulation should not be 
conceived of strictly in terms of affects. 
There continue to be differences among attachment theorists 
in the way they think about affects. Some are more explicitly 
sympathetic to the basic-emotions position than are others. A 
number of attachment theorists have come to adopt what is 
referred to as a "functionalist" position. This emphasizes, not 
just that affects themselves are regarded as subject to regula­
tion, but that they serve as regulators as well (N. Fox 1994). Affects and Affect Regulation / 91 
Others have tried to articulate a systems point of view that 
features the interdependence of all processes (Fogel 1993; Lewis 
and Granic 2000). What attachment theorists and researchers 
share is a commitment to follow out in development how affec­
tive experience contributes to the acquisition of self-regulation 
through coregulation between caregiver and infant. 
A problem area in attachment theory that bears on the topic 
of affects and affect regulation has been its conception of internal 
structure, or what is termed the "internal working models." 
Initially, the idea of working models was understood in a way 
that was close to being a reduplication of external interaction. 
Mary Main (1991) rendered the idea of working models more 
complex with her emphasis on metacognition—the higher-order 
capacity to appraise and reorganize memories. The notion of 
internal structure is developed even further in subsequent chap­
ters with the ideas of mentalization, and particularly the unfold­
ing of the capacity for mentalization. From the same epistemic 
tradition, this volume aims to make a contribution to the re-
conceptualization of attachment theory beyond Bowlby's notion 
of proximity to the caregiver and Sroufe and Water's (1977a) 
important qualification of "felt security." In the following chapter 
(chapter 3) we attempt to show that the realm of representation 
is not merely derived from, but constitutive of, the evolution of 
attachment. MacLean's (1990, 1993) theory ofthe triune brain, 
which distinguishes three stages of the brain's evolution—the 
reptilian, paleomammalian, and neomammalian—might be use­
fully applied to the difference between Bowlby's idea of proximity 
to the caregiver (which can be associated with the paleomam­
malian brain) and our focus on mentalization or reflective func­
tion (which can be associated with the neomammalian brain).12 
In the next section, we elaborate on the impact of reflective 
function on affective experience, introducing a new term— 
"mentalized affectivity"—to characterize this. In conclusion, 
12 MacLean observes that the paleomammalian brain is distinguished by the 
separation cry, the most primitive and basic mammalian vocalization; the 
neomammalian brain is produced through expanded memory and intelligence. 
MacLean's theory of the "triune brain," while provocative, has not been univer­
sally accepted. See, for example, Pinker's (1997) criticism of it. 

90 / Theoretical Perspectives 
According to Cassidy, affect regulation can be linked to the 
quality of attachment (1994, p. 247). The anxious/avoidant style 
of attachment tends to minimize affects and thus can be under­
stood in terms of the overregulation of affect; the anxious/ 
ambivalent style tends to heighten affects and thus can be 
understood in terms of the underregulation of affect. The secure 
style of attachment manifests an open and flexible kind of regu­
lation. More specifically, Cassidy maintains that in anxious/ 
avoidant attachment, the aversion to negative affect means that 
negative affect is not expressed, but not that it is not felt. 
In anxious/ambivalent attachment, it is unclear whether the 
greater responsiveness to negative affect means that it is ex­
pressed to a degree beyond how it is actually felt. Cassidy's work 
offers a promising way to think about affective experience 
for attachment theory and has been developed further by Slade 
(1999), who suggests how problems in dysregulation can be tied 
to various types of pathology. 
As attachment theory has evolved, so the concept of affect 
regulation has become increasingly central. Interest in affects 
themselves has been slower to evolve and is still in the process of 
developing. There is clearly an Aristotelian bias in attachment 
thinking about affects—they are, by nature, understood to be 
subject to modulation. There is not much evidence that attach­
ment theorists give much credence to the Stoic orientation to 
affects. Indeed, attachment theorists have not contended with 
the first system of emotional response as depicted by LeDoux 
and supported by Damasio. Hofer's (1984, 1990; Polan and Hofer 
1999) work with rat pups and mothers comes closest to doing so, 
as it offers an account of regulation through attachment that 
emphasizes hidden dimensions that are not subject to conscious 
control. Hofer warns us, in fact, that regulation should not be 
conceived of strictly in terms of affects.

AN INTEGRATED PERSPECTIVE 
ON AFFECTS AND AFFECT REGULATION 
In this concluding section, we sharpen our discussion of the 
relation between psychoanalysis and attachment theory on the 
subject of affects and affect regulation, leading us to reconsider 
the meaning of affect regulation and to reflect upon the closely 
related concepts of seUvregulation and mentalization. Finally, 
we move on to introduce the notion of "mentalized affectivity," 
the adult capacity to regulate affects, which will be discussed 
more fully in chapter 11 in connection with clinical material. 
Psychoanalysis and attachment theory dovetail in their depic­
tion of the important role played by affect regulation in early 
development, in facilitating the emergence of the sense of self 
and the transformation of coregulation to self-regulation. Both 
perspectives also concur in understanding affect regulation as a 
balance between positive and negative affect; in particular, they 
uphold the value of negative affect as opposed to assuming that 
it ought to be expunged. Yet, some tensions between psycho­
analysis and attachment theory have been uncovered as well (for 
a conceptual review see Fonagy 2001). Classical psychoanalysis 
views affects as connected with drives, and even in more contem­
porary versions of psychoanalysis there remains an affinity with 
the notion that affects are powerful, primitive forces. Insofar as 
affects are located in bodily experience, it makes sense that there 
will be limits to our awareness of them. Attachment theory, in 
contrast, distances itself from this way of thinking about affects. 
Affects are regarded as adaptive, and, moreover, affect regulation 
ensures that this is the case. 
It is tempting to conclude that while affects have primacy for 
psychoanalysts, affect regulation is cherished for attachment 
theorists. However, it would be a mistake to ignore the fact that 
affect regulation is important in psychoanalysis as well. As al-Affects and Affect Regulation / 93 
ready discussed, affect regulation in psychoanalysis is a concept 
with distinct connotations of struggle. It is subject, as every 
mental activity is, to the inherently conflictual nature of 
the mind: conscious experience is bound to run up against the 
unconscious. Affect regulation in attachment theory is conceived 
of more optimistically: secure attachment means that affect 
regulation can work well—that is, flexibly and reliably. Of course, 
attachment theory envisions less desirable forms of regulation 
(or dysregulation) in insecure attachment. Still, there is a differ­
ence between psychoanalysis and attachment theory in how 
affect regulation is understood. 
The tension between how affect regulation is understood in 
psychoanalysis and attachment theory reflects a larger confu­
sion about the meaning of the concept. As a term, affect regula­
tion is used in numerous senses and without much precision. 
Recent attempts in psychology to clarify the meaning(s) of affect 
regulation deserve our attention. Gross (1999) offers the defini­
tion of affect regulation as "processes by which individuals in­
fluence which emotions they have, when they have them, and 
how they experience and express these emotions" (p. 275). He 
endorses a "process-oriented approach" in which affect regula­
tion embraces situation selection, situation modification, atten­
tion deployment, cognitive change, and response modulation. 
Underlying Gross's point of view is an evolutionary perspective 
that construes emotions as "flexible response systems." The 
sources of affect regulation lie in both psychoanalysis and the 
stress and coping tradition, both of which, according to him, 
emphasize the reduction of negative affect. Gross claims, on the 
contrary, that affect regulation ought to include increasing, de­
creasing, and maintaining positive and negative affect. He also 
argues that affect regulation is best restricted to one's own 
relation to one's affects, rather than how one influences others' 
affects (how others' influence one's affects is not mentioned). 
Gross fails to take seriously the developmental ideas we have 
considered, wherein the infant's own affective experience is de­
termined by the interaction between himself and the primary 
caregiver. 
Anticipating Gross, Ross Thompson (1990, 1994) attempts to 
grapple with the lack of a clear definition of affect regulation. He

Anticipating Gross, Ross Thompson (1990, 1994) attempts to 
grapple with the lack of a clear definition of affect regulation. He 

IV-
94 / Theoretical Perspectives 
claims that we ought to think of affect regulation as "heterogene­
ous," not as a "unitary phenomenon." Nevertheless, Thompson 
moves on to formulate a definition that encompasses all of its 
many aspects. According to Thompson, affect regulation "con­
sists of the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for 
monitoring, evaluating and modifying emotional reactions, espe­
cially their intensive and temporal features, to accomplish one's 
goals" (1994, pp. 27-28). Affect regulation serves adaptive pur­
poses and, as Thompson makes clear, is closely connected 
to socialization. Thompson's sympathies for attachment theory 
mean that he is not willing to detach the issue of one's own 
relation to one's own affects from the issue of others' relation to 
one's affects. 
At the center of Thompson's investigation is an enumeration 
of the various objects of affect regulation: (a) neurophysiological 
processes underlying emotional arousal and its management, (b) 
attention processes, (c) informational processes—such as the 
reinterpretation of events (which is linked to defense mecha­
nisms), (d) encoding of internal cues, such as of the internal 
indicators of emotional arousal, (e) enhancing access to coping 
mechanisms, (/) helping to predict and control commonly en­
countered settings, and [g] expressing emotions in a satisfactory 
way—that is, concordant with one's personal goals for the situa­
tion. This comprehensive list conveys the broad range of aims 
that coincide with affect regulation—from the neurobiological 
basis of regulation to its role in successful adaptation to the 
social world. Although Thompson acknowledges an internal di­
mension of affect regulation {d above), his explanation focuses 
on experiences like the reinterpretation of rapid heart rate, 
breathing rate, and/or perspiration. The example he provides 
concerns an actor who manages stage fright by reinterpreting 
emotional arousal to signify the expected anticipation of public 
performance, rather than impending dysfunction. Thompson's 
understanding of the internal dimension of affect regulation is 
insightful, as it underscores that the concept should not be 
limited to its manifestation in action. Yet, as we will show, 
Thompson does not go far enough in capturing affect regulation 
viewed through the lens of mentalization. Affects and Affect Regulation / 95 
Our contribution to the project of clarifying the concept of 
affect regulation consolidates the earlier perspectives that have 
been discussed with the views presented above. At the lowest 
level of regulation, we must think of the organism's equilibrium, 
to which neuroscientists like Damasio and psychobiologists like 
Hofer have drawn our attention. On this level, affect regulation is 
equivalent to homeostasis; it occurs approximately and largely 
outside conscious awareness. Regulation prompts us to alter our 
state and to act expeditiously in circumstances where this is 
necessary—such as extreme situations in which survival is at 
stake. Choice can become part of this level of affect regulation, 
although the ensuing action can be spontaneous and without 
accompanying reflection. 
On another level, regulation occurs in connection with our 
relation to others. Regulation serves to help us to craft affects 
and to communicate them (at times in lieu of acting on them). 
Indeed, at this level, we are moving to deal with self-regulation as 
much as affect regulation. Affect regulation concerns the regula­
tion of affects, but it has implications for the self since it helps to 
bring the self into existence (see Gergely and Watson 1996, and 
chapter 4). Self-regulation occurs when the object of regulation is 
the self; this can be, but is not necessarily, achieved through 
affects. In one sense, self-regulation can be considered as a 
higher kind of affect regulation; in another sense, it constitutes 
a change in form. In order to clarify the change that takes place 
between affect regulation and self-regulation, it will be necessary 
to say more about what it means to be a self. 
Affect regulation on the second level is about the meaning 
that affects have for particular individuals. Insofar as regulation 
involves the capacity to remain within an affective state as one 
considers it, we have a different model from those found tradi­
tionally in philosophy and psychology, wherein cognition acts 
upon the affect. A precedent for what we have in mind here is 
found in Spinoza: while he stresses the use of reason over the 
affect, he emphasizes the value of allowing the affect to be felt for 
self-understanding. Like others, we appreciate that there must 
be a cognitive contribution to regulation—whether this is cast in 
terms of appraisal, attention, or informational processing—but

96 / Theoretical Perspectives 
we wish to posit the distinctive possibility of doing so while 
preserving the affective state. The state might be adjusted up­
ward (increased) or downward (decreased), and it might not be 
altered at all. 
Our point is certainly not to challenge the possibility of affect 
regulation leading to outward action. Our intention is merely to 
draw attention to a specific function of affect regulation that is 
predicated upon mentalization and that has not been described 
in the literature on regulation. Mentalization is the larger cat­
egory that includes self-regulation. Like self-regulation, reflective 
function does not necessarily concern affects. However, insofar 
as it does concern affects, affective experience will be processed 
in a more complex way. Just as reflective function brings about a 
new kind of interest in one's own mind, mentalization with 
affects brings about a new kind of relation to one's own affects. 
Let us try to distinguish and label this ultimate form of affect 
regulation. The concept of "mentalized affectivity" marks an 
adult capacity for affect regulation in which one is conscious of 
one's affects, while remaining within the affective state. Such 
affectivity denotes the capacity to fathom the meaning(s) of 
one's own affect states. This is a goal that is no less significant, 
evolutionarily speaking, than is the goal of acting upon one's 
emotions. It is worth noting how close the notion of mentalized 
affectivity is to what happens in psychoanalytic (and other kinds 
of) psychotherapy. It is widely appreciated by clinicians that it is 
crucial to understand one's own feelings experientially in a way 
that is emotionally meaningful (vs. intellectually). There is an 
especially deep appreciation in psychoanalysis for how difficult it 
can be to understand one's own affective states and experiences. 
Not only do we misunderstand what we feel, thinking that we 
feel one thing while we really feel another emotion; but we often 
feel more than one emotion, even contradictory emotions, at the 
same time. Mentalized affectivity enables us to be human—or, 
ironically put, to become even more human. The Behavior Geneticist's Challenge 
to a Psychosocial Model 
of the Development of Mentalization 
In this chapter, we consider the recent challenges to the psycho­
social approach taken in this book. The assumption that the 
quality of mentalizing is related to the quality of early object 
relations is a common thread throughout the volume. We argue 
that many of the known consequences of sensitive as opposed to 
neglecting and maltreating early environments might be under­
stood as having an impact on the child's capacity to mentalize. 
However, such assumptions concerning the influence of the 
child's family environment have recently been challenged by 
evidence from behavior genetics. Findings from studies of twins 
and from children adopted early in life are used to claim that 
past work has exaggerated the influence of parenting on child 
development. If substantiated, these critiques would remove the 
logical foundation of most psychodynamic or psychoanalytic ap­
proaches, rendering the present proposals, among others, un­
tenable. 
It is therefore incumbent upon us to review these critiques 
and to attempt a vigorous defense of the environmentalist posi­
tion. In the course of this defense, we will argue that the role of 
early experience is critical in determining gene expression and 
that the influence of early environment, as a moderator of the 
progress from genotypic potential to phenotypic outcome, may

INTRODUCTION 
Over the past ten years we—developmental professionals as well 
as the lay public—have unconsciously switched from a primarily 
psychosocial model of child and adult development to a genetic-
biological frame of reference that often a priori excludes consid­
eration of child-parent relationships. In an informal study, we 
asked twenty parents referred to an outpatient child community 
mental health clinic consecutively about the likely cause of their 
child's problems. It surprised no one that they all put brain 
chemistry at the top of the list. It was more surprising that "bad 
genes" came second, peers third, and early life experiences a 
poor fifth, just ahead of food additives. Why is this happening?

something to do with it. But this is not a sufficient explanation. 
The reduction of the mind to a genetically prefigured constella­

our free will, our mind is undoubtedly our most treasured pos­
session, it is also the source of all our sadness, conflict, pain, 
suffering, and misery. The reduction of models of pathology to a 
principally genetic mode of causation is undoubtedly a relatively 
comfortable solution for all of us—but like all comforts, it comes 
at a price. 
A fault line runs through modern developmental psychopa­

work (in attachment research, for instance), apparently oblivious 
to the work of behavior and molecular geneticists (the new 
nativists), who have in the meantime settled the entire issue of 
developmental causation, at least in principle, and are busy 
trying to find the genes and proteins to explain pathological brain 
development. Those who try to bridge the gap—Michael Rutter

their problems and ask something like: "Why do you think this

in my genes. There was no room for human mystery! This 
inability to envision psychological and psychosocial causation is 
both at the root of the psychological problems these individuals 
brought into the consulting-room and at the core of the naive 
nativist perspective. 
THE DEMISE OF SOCIALIZATION: 
PARENTING VERSUS GENETICS 
There are three primary agents of socialization of children in 
Western society: families, peer groups, and day-care centers or 
schools (Maccoby 2000). The emphasis, both professional and 
cultural, has been on the family as an agent of socialization. For 
the best part of the past century, both psychological theories 
(e.g., Alexander and Parsons 1982; Bowlby 1958; Patterson 
1976; Winnicott 1963) and commonsense psychological views 
(Leach 1997; Spock and Rothenberg 1985) agreed in Identifying 
experience with parents as pivotal in shaping an individual's 
values, beliefs, character, and, naturally, dysfunctions in adap­
tation. It is interesting to note that, of the two psychological A Psychosocial Modelofthe Development of Mentalization / 101 
approaches—learning theory and psychoanalysis—that domi­
nated the last century, it was the latter that retained some 
emphasis on the constitutional delimiters to socialization (e.g., 
Freud 1912-13, 1920g; Neu 1992). 
The last quarter of the twentieth century saw a dramatic 
realignment of developmental theories. The emergence of a cog­
nitive mental science (e.g., Barasalou 1991; Johnson-Laird 1983) 
prompted the translation of some learning and many psycho-
dynamic principles into the language of information processing, 
with presumed mental operations on past experience creating 
predictable biases and distortions (what used to be called 
psychic defenses) in mental representations (e.g., Bandura 1977; 
Mischel 1973). Cognitive behavioral approaches to development 
and psychopathology were ultimately saved from tautology and 
circularity by two factors: (a) the theory inspired a whole series of 
brief and effective psychosocial interventions (cognitive behav­
ioral therapy—e.g., Beck 1976; Meichenbaum 1997); and (b) the 
introduction of a dialectical model into developmental theory 
(e.g., Chess and Thomas 1979; Kagan 1989). 
The views of socialization that emerged from cognitive social 
learning theory have underscored that the child plays an im­
portant role in determining his own socialization experience. 
Clearly, mothering an infant high in emotionality must elicit 
quite a different set of maternal behaviors than would the 
mothering of a sociable, unemotional infant. This realization was 
critical in radically and helpfully moderating the parent-blaming 
tendency of early psychopathologists. Although these transac­
tional models of child-to-parent effects were later used to support 
the argument of those proposing a nativist revival, for the most 
part cognitive social learning theory maintained the environmen­
talist tradition of psychoanalytic theories. The simultaneous in­
dependent emergence in the late 1960s of the family systems 
perspective (e.g., Minuchin et al. 1975) and Bronfenbrenner's 
(1979) influential ecological ideas in the 1970s increased the 
explanatory power of socialization and further reinforced the 
focus of developmentalists on the social environment. 
Developmental psychopathology, permeated with the dialectic 
of social learning theory, came to dominate child psychiatric 
epidemiology, under the leadership of Norman Garmezy, with

Developmental psychopathology, permeated with the dialectic 
of social learning theory, came to dominate child psychiatric 
epidemiology, under the leadership of Norman Garmezy, with 

102 / Theoretical Perspectives 
other giants such as Michael Rutter, Alan Sroufe, Robert Emde, 
and Dante Cicchetti. The key research question came to be the 
mysterious unfolding, integration, and interaction of person and 
environmental characteristics in the generation of psychological 
disturbance through ontogenetic development. Notwithstanding 
the explicit commitment to a dialectic transactional model (e.g., 
Garmezy, Masten, and Tellegen 1984), developmental psycho­
pathology always retained its emphasis on socialization, par­
ticularly intrafamilial socialization (e.g., Cicchetti 1987; Rutter 
1993; Sameroff 1995). Attachment theory became one of the 
guiding frameworks of the approach (e.g., Cicchetti and Cohen 
1995; Sroufe and Rutter 1984), and John Bowlby was, to some 
degree posthumously, recognized by many as one of its pioneers 
(Sroufe 1986). Thus, notwithstanding the dominance of cognitive 
psychology and social learning theory, developmental psycho­
pathology remained a broad church, and many psychodynamic 
concerns—in particular a focus on early relationships (e.g., 
Cicchetti 1987), on affect regulation (e.g., Sroufe 1996), on rela­
tionship representations (e.g., Dodge 1990), and on processes 
of identification (e.g., Crittenden 1994), internalization (e.g., 
Fonagy et al. 1995), and self-organization (e.g., Fischer and 
Ayoub 1994)—were retained. 
In the last quarter of the twentieth century, developmental 
psychopathologists were mostly concerned with risk factors— 
risk factors associated with the family occupying a most impor­
tant role (e.g., Masten and Garmezy 1985). Developmental psy­
chopathology of the early years of development was particularly 
concerned with social and cultural facets of risk (e.g., Masten 
and Braswell 1991), parent-infant relationships, epistemic and 
motivational mental states that influence parenting (e.g., Belsky 
1984), the interaction of economic and social disadvantage with 
parenting (e.g., McLoyd 1990; Quinton, Rutter, and Liddle 1984), 
the distorting influences of past experience on emotional and 
cognitive structures of the child (e.g., Fox, Platz, and Bentley 
1995; Parker, Barrett, and Hickie 1992), and parental behaviors 
as mediators of the gross social inequalities that became an 
increasing source of concern for social scientists of the Thatcher 
and Reagan years (e.g., Conger, Ge, Elder, Lorenz, and Simons 
1994; McLoyd 1998; Petit, Bates, and Dodge 1997). Permeating A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 103 
all these ideas was the notion that the unfolding of psycho 
pathology occurred in the context ofthe child's primary socializa­
tion environment: the family. The family, the parents in parti­
cular, provided the backdrop against which this unfolding oc­
curred—rtheir characteristics were crucial to the developmental 
choices the child would make, their actions and collaboration 
critical to both treatment and prevention. 
However, over the last decade of the twentieth century, per­
haps in part triggered by the excitement of the human genome 
project, but also by research designs of increasing statistical 
sophistication, quantitative behavior genetics was unleashed on 
early development research. At a certain point it seemed as 
though research in genetics had all but eliminated the place 
for classical socialization theories that placed an emphasis on 
parenting, such as attachment theory, and had refuted all theo­
ries that advocated the key role of early family experience (see 
Scarr 1992). For example, the behavior geneticist Rowe wrote: 
"parents in most working to professional class families may 
have little influence on what traits their children may eventually 
develop as adults" (1994, p. 7). He went on to say that he 
doubted whether any undesirable trait displayed by a child can 
be significantly modified by anything a.parent does. In fairness, 
it should be noted that these comments were published before 
data became available from research that gave equal weight to 
both genetic and social influences on development. 
The Findings from Behavior Genetics 
The biological (genetic) movement of the 1990s highlighted a 
number of issues that seemed to threaten the validity of the 
kinds of environmentalist claims we are making in this book. 
1. The overall connection between early parenting and social­
ization outcomes turns out to be quite weak, and in longitudinal 
studies parenting accounts for negligible proportions of the vari­

psychopathology. Furthermore, the implicit assumption that

kinds of environmentalist claims we are making in this book. 
1. The overall connection between early parenting and social­
ization outcomes turns out to be quite weak, and in longitudinal 
studies parenting accounts for negligible proportions of the vari­
ance. There is very limited evidence that might link early 
relationship experiences to the development of personality and 
psychopathology. Furthermore, the implicit assumption that 

104 / Theoretical Perspectives 
genetic influences occur only in early life, and therefore that 
later emerging differences between individuals can be safely 
assumed to be environmental, turns out to be false. Genetic 
influences are just as changing and as dynamic as environmen­
tal influences. For example, genetic influences on IQ are rela­
tively small in early years but increase considerably as the child 
moves toward adolescence (Rutter et al. 1997) and conversely 
the influence of parenting on aptitude test scores declines 
(Plomin, Fulker, Corley, and DeFries 1997). As we shall see, it is 
quite possible that at the molecular level some genes are dor­
mant in early phases of development but their activity is pro­
moted in subsequent stages. In fact, genetic influences pre­
disposing to the same trait—such as antisocial behavior—can 
change over the course of development without altering the size 
of the genetic component. Thus, the heritability of antisocial 
behavior is 63% in early adolescence and 68% in late adoles­
cence, but only about a third of this variability overlaps (i.e., is 
the same part of the genetic makeup at each stage) (Neiderhiser, 
Reiss, and Hetheringtoh 1996). 
2. Behavior-genetic models of twin and adoption studies par­
tition variability into genetic (h) and environmental (E) compo­
nents by subtracting the proportion of variability on a specific 
trait accounted for by genes (h2) from 100 (E = 100 - h2). In most 
domains h2 is 50-60%, with less than half left to E. For atten­
tion-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), heritability is esti­
mated to vary from 55% to 82% (Nigg and Goldsmith 1998; 
Smalley 1997) As large-scale studies continue to emerge, the 
proportion of variance that is left after subtracting genetic influ­
ence is diminishing. 
3. Behavior-genetics research has revealed that influences that 
had previously been considered environmental (such as children 
whose caregivers read to them learning to read earlier than those 
who are not read to) were actually mostly mediated by the 
shared genetic predisposition of caregiver and offspring (Kendler 
et al. 1996). Apparently environmentally mediated family influ­
ences are in fact explained by the shared genetic predisposition 
of caregiver and offspring and therefore are possibly in them-A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 105 
selves unimportant (J. R. Harris 1998; Rowe 1994). Recently, an 
analysis of the Colorado Adoption Project showed that many of 
the milder adverse effects on social, adjustment associated with 
parental divorce are in fact genetic: children who are adopted 
away from parents who later get divorced develop adjustment 
problems even if they are adopted into nondivorcing families 
(O'Connor, Caspi, DeFries, arid Plomin 2000). The quality ofthe 
environments that are thought to be so important to develop­
ment, including stress, life events, and trauma (and probably 
also maternal attunement and sensitivity), can all be inherited. 
It is likely that personality characteristics that we had often 
thought of as—and what the child might experience as—the 
consequence of the parents' behavior toward the child are in fact 
genetic predispositions. It might be that the particular personal­
ity trait in the child and the associated form of parenting (criti­
cism, warmth, or even abuse) are both consequences ofthe same 
genes in the parent and the child or that the prodromal version 
ofthe child's trait might elicit—say, by evocatory projective iden­
tification (Spillius 1992)—a particular way for the parent to be 
with the child. 
4. Correlations between characteristics of early parenting and 
later child behavior can be reinterpreted given that any associa­
tion may be attributable to the 50% of genetic overlap between a 
parent and a biological child. This has been termed passive 
genotype-environment correlation. As genetic factors influence 
the independent variables (measures of the social environment) 
and the dependent variables (measures of social adjustment), 
there is a potential for confounding. In the majority of published 
socialization studies this possibility is not acknowledged. Reiss, 
Neiderhiser, Hetherington, and Plomin (2000), in a landmark 
investigation of genetic and environmental influences on adoles­
cent development, found that of 52 statistically significant asso­
ciations between family relationship (e.g., parental warmth or 
sibling relationships) and measures of adjustment (e.g., depres­
sion and antisocial behavior), 44 showed genetic influences that 
accounted for more than half of the covariance. In almost half of 
the 52, little association between family relations and adolescent 
functioning remained once genetic influence was taken into con-

104 / Theoretical Perspectives 
genetic influences occur only in early life, and therefore that 
later emerging differences between individuals can be safely 
assumed to be environmental, turns out to be false. Genetic 
influences are just as changing and as dynamic as environmen­
tal influences. For example, genetic influences on IQ are rela­
tively small in early years but increase considerably as the child 
moves toward adolescence (Rutter et al. 1997) and conversely 
the influence of parenting on aptitude test scores declines 
(Plomin, Fulker, Corley, and DeFries 1997). As we shall see, it is 
quite possible that at the molecular level some genes are dor­
mant in early phases of development but their activity is pro­
moted in subsequent stages. In fact, genetic influences pre­
disposing to the same trait—such as antisocial behavior—can 
change over the course of development without altering the size 
of the genetic component. Thus, the heritability of antisocial 
behavior is 63% in early adolescence and 68% in late adoles­
cence, but only about a third of this variability overlaps (i.e., is 
the same part of the genetic makeup at each stage) (Neiderhiser, 
Reiss, and Hetheringtoh 1996). 
2. Behavior-genetic models of twin and adoption studies par­
tition variability into genetic (h) and environmental (E) compo­
nents by subtracting the proportion of variability on a specific 
trait accounted for by genes (h2) from 100 (E = 100 - h2). In most 
domains h2 is 50-60%, with less than half left to E. For atten­
tion-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), heritability is esti­
mated to vary from 55% to 82% (Nigg and Goldsmith 1998; 
Smalley 1997) As large-scale studies continue to emerge, the 
proportion of variance that is left after subtracting genetic influ­
ence is diminishing. 
3. Behavior-genetics research has revealed that influences that 
had previously been considered environmental (such as children 
whose caregivers read to them learning to read earlier than those 
who are not read to) were actually mostly mediated by the 
shared genetic predisposition of caregiver and offspring (Kendler 
et al. 1996). Apparently environmentally mediated family influ­
ences are in fact explained by the shared genetic predisposition 
of caregiver and offspring and therefore are possibly in them-A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 105 
selves unimportant (J. R. Harris 1998; Rowe 1994). Recently, an 
analysis of the Colorado Adoption Project showed that many of 
the milder adverse effects on social, adjustment associated with 
parental divorce are in fact genetic: children who are adopted 
away from parents who later get divorced develop adjustment 
problems even if they are adopted into nondivorcing families 
(O'Connor, Caspi, DeFries, arid Plomin 2000). The quality ofthe 
environments that are thought to be so important to develop­
ment, including stress, life events, and trauma (and probably 
also maternal attunement and sensitivity), can all be inherited. 
It is likely that personality characteristics that we had often 
thought of as—and what the child might experience as—the 
consequence of the parents' behavior toward the child are in fact 
genetic predispositions. It might be that the particular personal­
ity trait in the child and the associated form of parenting (criti­
cism, warmth, or even abuse) are both consequences ofthe same 
genes in the parent and the child or that the prodromal version 
ofthe child's trait might elicit—say, by evocatory projective iden­
tification (Spillius 1992)—a particular way for the parent to be 
with the child. 
4. Correlations between characteristics of early parenting and 
later child behavior can be reinterpreted given that any associa­
tion may be attributable to the 50% of genetic overlap between a 
parent and a biological child. This has been termed passive 
genotype-environment correlation. As genetic factors influence 
the independent variables (measures of the social environment) 
and the dependent variables (measures of social adjustment), 
there is a potential for confounding. In the majority of published 
socialization studies this possibility is not acknowledged. Reiss, 
Neiderhiser, Hetherington, and Plomin (2000), in a landmark 
investigation of genetic and environmental influences on adoles­
cent development, found that of 52 statistically significant asso­
ciations between family relationship (e.g., parental warmth or 
sibling relationships) and measures of adjustment (e.g., depres­
sion and antisocial behavior), 44 showed genetic influences that 
accounted for more than half of the covariance. In almost half of 
the 52, little association between family relations and adolescent 
functioning remained once genetic influence was taken into con-

106 / Theoretical Perspectives 
sideration. In the Colorado Adoption Project, the parents* report 
of warmth versus negativity in the family and the child's report 
of achievement orientation appear associated, but achievement 
orientation turns out to be genetically detennined, suggesting 
that aspects of the family environment are susceptible to the 
influence of the child's genetically rooted characteristics^-the 
so-called child-to-parent effects (Deater-Deckard, Fulker, and 
Plomin 1999). 
5. Insofar as behavior-genetic studies showed family environ­
ment to matter, it was the environment specific to each child 
within the same family [nonshared environment) that mattered 
(Plomin and Daniels 1987). Environment may be partitioned into 
a shared and a nonshared component. Shared environmental 
influences may be estimated in adoption studies by comparing 
the correlation of adopted children and their adopted siblings 
with children in other households. If shared aspects of the 
environment, such as parenting, were indeed formative, then 
adopted siblings living in the same home should be significantly 
more alike than unrelated children across households. After the 
genetic and shared environmental components are estimated, 
what remains is the nonshared environment (Eus = 100 - h2 - EJ. 
The nonshared environment appears to be the bulk of the en­
vironmental component; shared environment, an instance of 
which would be parental sensitivity, accounts for almost no 
variance (Plomin 1994). Adopted children, it seems, are no more 
like their adopted siblings than are unrelated children growing 
up in a different household (Plomin and Bergeman 1991). This is 
important because the relatively weak observed effects of the 
shared environment have been used to suggest that environ­
ments generally assumed to be toxic by developmental psycho­
pathology (such as high level of parental conflict, parental psy­
chiatric disturbance, or even relative social disadvantage) are 
either of less importance than previously thought or, more prob­
ably, are actually genetically mediated (Plomin, Chipuer, and 
Neiderhiser 1994). Plomin put this quite elegantly: 
So often we have assumed that the key influences on children's 
development are shared: their parents' personality and child-A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 107 
hood experiences, the quality of their parents' marriage relation­
ship, children's educational background, the neighborhood in 
which they grow up, and their parents' attitude to school or to 
discipline. Yet to the extent that these Influences are shared, 
they cannot account for the differences we observe in children's 
outcomes. [1994, p. 23] 
6. It has been argued that even nonshared environmental 
effects may be better understood as being genetic in origin. 
Genetically influenced aspects of children's behavior may be 
responsible for provoking specific observed responses in parents 
and other people. This is sometimes termed evocative covariance, 
when children with different genetic predispositions elicit com­
plementary responses from the caregiver. Thus, the child's 
nonshared (specific) environment may sometimes have been 
erroneously attributed to parental behavior rather than to his 
genes (O'Connor, Deater-Deckard, Fulker, Rutter, and Plomin 
1998). Some studies of adopted children suggest that authori­
tarian parenting, which has been thought to account for op­
positional behavior in children, may be elicited by the child's 
resistive or distractible behavior (Ge, Conger, Cadoret, Neider­
hiser, and Yates 1996). 
Thus, it seems that over the past ten years we—developmental 
professionals as well as the lay public—have unconsciously 
switched from a primarily psychosocial model of child and adult 
development consistent with psychodynamic ideas to a genetic-
biological frame of reference that often a priori excludes consid­
eration of child-parent relationships. We will now argue that the 
case for reducing the emphasis on parenting, particularly the 
emphasis on the early attachment relationships, is based on 
false evaluations of behavior-genetic data, and that perhaps in 
the past our emphasis on the role of parenting was somewhat 
naive in trying to see the parents' influence simply in terms of 
relationship quality, internalization, introjection, identification, 
and so on. We try to show that (a) early attachment experiences 
may well be key moderators of the expression of individual 
genotype, and (b) the primary evolutionary function of attach­
ment may indeed be the contribution it makes to the ontogenetic

psychosocial experiences relevant for gene expression. 
Scrutinizing the Case for Genetics 
As demonstrated earlier, the case for genetic determinants rests 
on two pillars: (a) the weakness ofthe socialization evidence, and 
(b) the findings of quantitative behavior genetics. We will just 
touch on the first and focus ori the second. 
Classical reviews extensively cited by behavior geneticists 
(e.g., Maccoby and Martin 1983) tended to reveal weak correla­
tions between parenting and- socialization outcomes open to 
alternative, genetic interpretations. However, there have been 
substantial methodological improvements in studies of social­
ization, in terms both of the breadth and of the depth of meas­
urement, and correspondingly effect sizes have also increased. 
For example, Martin Maldonado-Duran and his colleagues, in a 
study at the Menninger Child and Family Center (Maldonado-
Duran, Helmig, Moody, and Millhuff, in press; Maldonado-Duran 
et al. in press), carried out operationalized clinical ratings of 
almost 150 infants. Over 70% of the children have so far been 
followed up two to four years later. Infant behavior problems 
strongly predicted later behavioral difficulties in a number of 
areas. Parenting observed in infancy predicted preschool emo­
tional difficulties. In particular, parents who were both neglect­
ful and hostile had children with more behavioral problems. This 
remained true even when behavioral problems in infancy were 
controlled for. Observed neglect and hostility toward the child 
correlated 0.36 with the child's behavioral problems noted at age 
4 years, even when infant behavior was already controlled for. 
This implies that parenting had a predictable effect beyond that 
which could be explained in terms of the parent responding 
specifically to the precursors of the child's behavioral problems. 
Better-controlled studies, such as this one, are accumulating, 
and current reviews of the socialization literature tend to yield 
more encouraging conclusions (Maccoby 2000). 
A considerable complexity is introduced into the interpreta­
tion of social environment to behavioral-outcome correlations by A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 109 
the recognition that the parenting environment varies in signifi­
cance across development and even within each developmental 
phase across time. Therapeutic experience shows us the excep­
tional influence of certain "key moments" of interaction between 
therapist and patient, when experience brought into clear relief 
by a confluence of circumstance and intrapsychic factors sud­
denly enables therapeutic change. (This idea is fully elaborated 
in the work of Daniel Stern, Ed Tronick, Karlen Lyons-Ruth, and 
the Boston group on therapeutic process—Fonagy 1998; Lyons-
Ruth 1999; Stern 1998; Stern et al. 1998.) They argue that 
change in therapy might be a function of special moments of 
attunement between therapist and patient. More generally, the 
same could apply to special moments of influence of parents on 
children—naturally with both a positive and a negative valence— 
moments of parenting influence, however key and formative, 
that might be the needles in a socialization haystack. It is 
difficult to imagine how observational research, focusing on 
aggregate or timersampled behaviors, can hope to capture sig­
nificant numbers of such key moments. The correlations be­
tween observed parenting and child outcome may never reflect 
the true influence of parenting. 
In any case, however strong the associations between pa­
renting and socialization, the possibility that the more parsimo­
nious explanation is genetic cannot be ruled out. It is the ap­
parent strength of genetic findings, the massive proportion of 
variability accounted for, no matter how specific the trait, that 
casts such a dark shadow over developmental psychopathology. 
But are the genetic findings as unequivocal as they seem? Let us 
offer a brief, robust rebuttal of quantitative behavior genetics. 
The evidence from behavior genetics should be interpreted 
with caution. The reasons are: (a) methodological, (b) conceptual, 
and (c) empirical. Methodologically, the contrast of identical and 
fraternal twins confounds genetic similarity and environmental 
influence. It has been claimed that identical twins have more 
similar environments than do fraternal ones (e.g., they have 
more friends in common, they are treated more similarly by the 
parents^Reiss et al. 2000). The status of inferring environmen­
tal effects by a process of subtraction using the additive model 
has also been questioned (Elman et al. 1996; Turkheimer 1998).

In particular, • E is estimated without any direct measure of 
environmental factors. If the estimate for heritability, G, is high, 
E must be low. In reality, G and E combine to generate a 
phenotype. In simple additive models, however, this interaction 
would be pooled with genetic effects. The use of parents as a 
source of data about themselves as well as their child creates an 
inbuilt genetic bias. Heritability estimates are inflated by the use 
of parents' reports of child behavior rather than behavioral ob­
servation or self-reports. It is not surprising that when parents 
rate a child's aggression, the correlation with' the parent's ag­
gression should increase (Cadoret, Leve, and Devor 1997; Miles 
and Carey 1997). 
At a conceptual level, we may certainly question the notion of 
nonshared environment, since it merely refers to intersibling 
differences, not to their environment. In fact, shared environ­
ments could as easily serve to make children in the family 
different from one another as to increase intrafamilial similarity, 
since shared environments may be experienced very differently 
by two children. A further conceptual problem concerns herit­
ability estimates based solely on individual differences—esti­
mates that remove shared environmental effects such as secular 
trends and are strictly restricted to the environment studied. 
Height, IQ, as well as the prevalence of a number of psychologi­
cal disorders (such as delinquency and eating disorder) have 
increased markedly over the last century, undoubtedly as a 
consequence of environmental changes, yet current behavioral-
genetic methods of estimating environmental effects preclude 
consideration of these. 
Empirically, we could point to studies where environmental 
determinants revealed substantial effects after genetic influences 
had been excluded (Johnson, Cohen, Brown, Smailes, and Bern­
stein 1999). We could raise questions about the actual—rather 
than assumed—differential responsiveness of caregivers to sib­
lings. Evidence on just how differently siblings are treated is 
actually quite mixed. In one ofthe only behavioral-genetic stud­
ies to actually look at the child's environment rather than simply 
infer it, Reiss, Plomin, Hetherington, and colleagues found direct 
evidence for the notion of the nonshared environment (Reiss et A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 111 
al. 2000). The difference between the degree of coerciveness of 
parenting between a pair of twins was more predictive than was 
the absolute level of negativity (Reiss et al. 1995). However, Judy 
Dunn's naturalistic observational studies of siblings actually 
suggest that while cross-sectionally parents may appear to be 
treating siblings differently, looked at longitudinally children at 
various ages receive comparable treatment (Dunn and McGuire 
1994). The obvious implication here is for a more systemic 
approach. 
Regardless of the ultimate conclusion concerning the differing 
treatment of siblings, the fact that studies of social development 
have tended to look at single children implied that they have on 
the whole underestimated the impact of parenting and other 
shared environmental influences. As we shall see later on, there 
may be specific pressures in family systems for different re­
sponses of siblings as part ofthe need for each person within the 
system to have a unique role. Interestingly, the pressure for 
difference may be greater when genetic differentiation is least. In 
a recent study, Pasco Fearon and Peter Fonagy attempted to 
establish the role of genetic influence on patterns of attachment 
(Fonagy, Fearon, and Target 1999). The question concerning 
genetic influence was raised by transgenerational studies of 
consistency in attachment patterns (mothers whose attachment 
was secure before the birth of the child tended to have babies 
securely attached to them one year later—van IJzendoorn 1995). 
Is this another example of a genetic effect? In a study of identical 
and nonidentical twins, we found very little evidence for greater 
concordance of attachment patterns among monozygotic twins. 
However, we found that the likelihood of concordance in attach­
ment patterns was predicted by mothers' assessment of the 
temperaments of their twins. Briefly, the more similar the 
mother rated the two infants' temperaments, the more likely it 
was that the twins' attachment classifications were to be dis­
similar. Conversely, the more the mother differentiated between 
the temperaments of her twins, the more likely they would be 
congruent in terms of their attachment classification. In inter^ 
preting these results, we tentatively suggest that if the mother 
fails to differentiate between her children consciously, she is

temperaments of their twins. Briefly, the more similar the 
mother rated the two infants' temperaments, the more likely it 
was that the twins' attachment classifications were to be dis­
similar. Conversely, the more the mother differentiated between 
the temperaments of her twins, the more likely they would be 
congruent in terms of their attachment classification. In inter^ 
preting these results, we tentatively suggest that if the mother 
fails to differentiate between her children consciously, she is 

IMI

more likely to project unconscious expectations onto one or 
other twin, forcing them to be different in relation to her. Alter­
natively, being seen as different at some level may mean that the 
twins do not feel that they have to find a place for themselves in 
the family system. If the mother is able to see their individuality, 
then they can behave consistently with their predispositions. 
Furthermore, on occasion experimental manipulations of the 
environment as part of treatment and prevention interventions 
have yielded relatively large effects. It is noteworthy that neither 
of the two major attacks on the importance of family on social­
ization (J. R. Harris 1998; Rowe 1994) covers parent training. 
The average effect size of parent training for children with Oppo­
sitional Defiant Disorder is around 1 (Serketich and Dumas 
1996), which means that the average treated child is better off at 
the end of treatment than at least 84% of the controls. More 
relevant in this context is the fact that accumulating evidence 
supports the usefulness of experimental interventions with par­
ents, such as home visitation (e.g., Olds et al. 1998), with long-
term beneficial effects in reducing the risk of criminality and 
delinquency. Of course, the impact of environmental manipula­
tion is often not as large as one would hope; moreover, long-term 
follow-ups in treatment studies are relatively rare, and even 
quite impressive changes initiated by experimental interventions 
dissipate (Fonagy, Target, Cottrell, Phillips, and Kurtz 2000). 
As clinicians, our main objection to behavior-genetic data 
would not be methodological, conceptual, or empirical but, 
rather, pragmatic. Genetic effects may well be indirect as well as 
direct. Even a high genetic loading for a certain environmental 
hazard does not mean that the consequences associated with 
that risk factor would necessarily be genetically rather than 
environmentally mediated. For example, if child abuse were 
found to have a large genetic component, its toxic effects would 
still be via the destruction of trust in the world for the abused 
child rather than via a purely genetic process. The implications 
of behavior-genetic data for clinical intervention are thus quite 
limited. But the continuing tension between perspectives based 
on genetics research and environmental studies should not be 
played out on the battlefield of the assumptions underlying the 
genetic model. The findings from behavior genetics appear quite A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 113 
robust, and the burden is on environmentalists to integrate the 
genetic data with their theories. What follows is a very modest 
preliminary attempt at the integration of selective genetics find­
ings with environmentalist observations arising from the field 
under consideration in this volume: the relationship of mental­
ization and early attachment relationships. 
SUBJECTIVITY AT THE INTERFACE 
OF GENE AND ENVIRONMENT 
The Role of Experience 
in the Expression of the Genotype 
It is universally acknowledged that developmental psychopathol­
ogy involves a gene-environment interaction. In the case of 
honeybees, the reproductive and social roles of colony members 
are fixed by events that occur during the first few days of larval 
development. Worker or queen bee status is apparently not 
encoded in the genotype but follows from the differential treat­
ment of larvae by worker bees, resulting in differential gene 
expression—both up-regulation and down-regulation (Evans and 
Wheeler 2000). Some quantitative human behavior-genetic stud­
ies also strongly suggest interactive processes whereby environ­
mental exposure triggers genetic vulnerability. For example, the 
classic Finnish adoptive-family study of schizophrenia suggests 
that children with a schizophrenic biological parent were more 
likely to develop a range of psychiatric problems if, and only if, 
they were adopted into dysfunctional families (Tienari, Wynne, 
Moring, Lahti, and Naarala 1994). Bohman (1996) reported that 
criminality appeared to be associated with a genetic risk only if 
children whose biological parents were criminals were adopted 
into dysfunctional homes. So genetic risk may or may not be­
come manifest, depending on the quality of the family environ­
ment to which a child is exposed. But if this is such a pervasive 
process, then why is the quantitative behavior-genetic evidence 
for gene-environment interaction so sparse? Empirically, this

The Role of Experience

interaction term has proved to be quite hard to find. Plomin's 
(Plomin, DeFries, McLearn, and Rutter 1997) systematic review 
of the literature, now admittedly somewhat dated, found evi­
dence only for relatively isolated examples. 
We suggest that the answer lies in the fact that behavior 
genetics sometimes studies the "wrong" environment, because 
the environment that triggers the expression of a gene is not 
objective. Gene expression is not triggered by the observable, 
objective environment. The child's experience ofthe environment 
is what counts. The manner in which environment is experi­
enced will act as a filter in the expression of genotype into 
phenotype. And here we touch on the pivotal importance of 
psychoanalysis and attachment theory, the primary concern of 
which is with the interaction of multiple layers of representa­
tions in generating developmental outcomes. Data from genetics 
call for exactly such sophistication in understanding the way 
genes may or may not be expressed in particular individuals. 
The pathway between genes and phenotypes is a tortuous 
one, with genetics and environment constantly interacting 
(Elman et al. 1996). At the molecular level, evidence suggests 
that positive and negative environments may alter gene expres­
sion—that is, the rate at which genes are transcribed into RNA 
and subsequent protein synthesis that can, at least in principle, 
influence the structure and functioning of the human brain. 
Internal and external stimuli, steps in the development of the 
brain, hormones, stress, learning, and social interaction all alter 
the binding of transcription regulators (Kandel 1998). Of particu­
lar interest are animal studies that suggest that various forms of 
learning in animals reflect a process whereby environmental 
stimuli—such as songs and calls from, one bird to another—may 
activate the transcription of RNA from dormant genes, leading to 
new proteins being synthesized and changes of synaptic struc­
ture and function (Chew, Vicario, and Nottebohm 1996; Nguyen, 
Abel, and Kandel 1994). The very process of learning may be 
genetically controlled. Environmental stimuli involved in the 
conditioning of gill reflexes in Aplysia act to turn off memory 
suppressor genes (Abel and Kandel 1998). Perhaps more relevant 
to us from an attachment standpoint are the classic studies of 
rat pups separated from their mother in the first two weeks of A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 115 
life, who appear to incur a permanent increase in the expression 
of genes controlling the secretion of CRF (corticotrophm-releas-
ing factor) (Plotsky and Meaney 1993). While the maternally 
deprived rat pups may acquire a life-long vulnerability to stress 
through this permanent increase in gene expression, dams who 
showed increased care of their pups by licking and grooming 
them during nursing seemed to provide them with a life-long 
protection from stress. This latter process appeared to be medi­
ated through the enhanced expression of genes regulating gluco­
corticoid receptors and the consequent suppression of genes 
regulating CRF synthesis (Liu et al. 1997). 
There is substantial individual variability in response to 
stress and adversity. Much of this variability is poorly under­
stood (Rutter 1999), but it underscores the potential importance 
of intrapsychic variables. Whether or not specific environmental 
factors trigger the expression of a gene may depend not only on 
the nature of those factors, but also on the way the infant or 
child experiences them, which will be an intrapsychic function 
that is determined by conscious or unconscious meaning attri­
bution to these experiences. The quality of the experiential filter 
that attachment provides may, in turn, be a function of either 
genetic or environmental influences, or their interaction (Kandel 
1998). Thus intrapsychic representational processes are not just 
the consequences of environmental and genetic effects—they 
may be critical moderators of these effects. 
This has substantial clinical significance, since the under­
standing of an environment by the child is more readily modifi­
able than are the environment itself or the genes with which the 
environment interacts (Emde 1988). An attachment-theory in­
trapsychic perspective may be helpful in considering not just 
what precipitates personality and its disorders, but also which 
processes influence the course of the disorder for better or 
worse. Until the last five years this was theory, but now the 
collaboration of molecular geneticists and attachment theory is 
making it a reality. We will offer three examples of this powerful 
paradigm.

vation than are individuals with the "long" allele (Bennett et al., 
2002). Actually the full story is somewhat more complicated. The 
work of Suomi's laboratory over the last decade demonstrated 
that peer-reared (maternally deprived) infants grow up to be 
socially anxious in nature, to have a reactive temperament (a 
tendency to become emotionally aroused, aggressive, impulsive, 
and fearful), and to drop to the bottom of dominance hierarchies 
(Higley, King, et al. 1996; Suomi 1997). If their early attachment 
experiences are poor, then their neuro-endocrine functioning 
will become highly abnormal; they will have lower CSF (cerebro­
spinal fluid) concentrations of 5-HIAA (Higley, Supmi, and 
Linnoila 1996), indicating decreased serotonergic functioning. 
They will also consume larger amounts of alcohol (Higley, 
Hasert, Suomi, and Linnoila 1991) and will develop tolerance to 
it faster, in line with their serotonin turnover rates (Higley et al. 
in press), which, in turn, is associated with serotonin trans­
porter availability (Heinz et al. 1998). The 5-HTT is the serotonin 
transporter gene that has been implicated' in impaired serot­
onergic function (Lesch et al. 1996) for the short allele of the 
gene (Heils et al. 1996).! In the Suomi rhesus-monkey colony, 
5-HIAA CSF concentration was lower in monkeys with the short 
allele of 5-HTT—^-but only for peer-reared monkeys. For mother-
reared subjects, 5-HIAA concentrations were identical for mon­
keys with either allele (Bennett et al. 2002). The experience of an 
inadequate early environment triggered the expression of the 5-
HTT gene. 
The reversibility of genetic vulnerability was indicated in 
studies where the foster-mothering of specially bred high-reac­
tive monkey infants was experimentally manipulated. Reactive

1998). Two further studies showed mixed findings (Gelernter, Kranzler, Coccaro, 
Siever, and New 1998; Rosenthal et al. 1998). Nine studies, however, found no 
association (Ball et al. 1997; Deary et al. 1999; Ebstein et al. 1997; Flory et 
al. 1999; Gustavsson et al. 1999; Hamilton et al. 1999; Herbst, Zonderman, 
McCrae, and Costa 2000; Jorm et al. 2000; Kumakiri et al. 1999). Thus, as in

a larger social group, they were particularly adept at recruiting

and maintained high positions in the dominance hierarchy 
(Suomi 1991). The maternal style of high-reactive females raised 
by nurturant mothers reflected the style of their nurturant fos­
ter-mothers rather than their own temperament. Thus the ben­
efits of nurturant foster-mothering can evidently be transmitted 
to the next generation, even though the mode of transmission is 
nongenetic in nature (Suomi and Levine 1998). Calm mothering 
of these genetically vulnerable individuals not only will reduce 
the risk associated with this genotype, but there is some evi­
dence that if they receive particularly sensitive caregiving, these 
individuals will develop special capacities of resilience. 
A further example of the same kind of gene-environment 
interaction comes from our collaborative studies at the Men­
ninger Clinic (Fonagy, Stein, and White 2001). We have focused 
on the alleles ofthe second dopamine receptor (DRD2). The Al or 
A1A2 allele exists in only a minority of normal subjects (usually 
no more than 20%). Its prevalence has been shown to be elevated 
in a number of clinical groups, particularly those with problems 
of alcoholism (Blum et al. 1990; Gelernter, Goldman, and Risch 
1993), gambling (Comings, Muhleman, and Gysin 1996), sub­
stance misuse (Uhl, Blum, Noble, and Smith 1993), and eating 
disorders (Comings 1997). Accounts of these findings mostly 
invoke the observations of reduced numbers of D2 receptors. We 
have been able to replicate these results in a traumatized border­
line-personality-disordered sample at the Menninger Clinic, 
many of whom naturally have dependency and other similar 
problems. As part of a study on the effect of early trauma, we are 
collecting retrospective information on childhood trauma using 
Toni Bifulco's Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Instru­
ment (Bifulco, Brown, and Harris 1987). Concurrently, childhood 
data were collected on a substantial subgroup of the individuals 
assessed, as these individuals attended the Menninger therapeu­
tic preschool.

A very preliminary analysis of a relatively smalt sample [n = 
78) suggests that the Al allele may be a biological marker for the 
effect of certain types of trauma. Based on largely retrospective 

118 / Theoretical Perspectives 
information, we found that the impact of trauma on adult per­
sonality functioning as measured by Jonathan Hill and col­
leagues' APFA measure (Hill, Harrington, Fudge, Rutter, and 
Pickles 1989) was restricted to the subgroup who had the Al 
allele. However, the effect appeared to be limited to certain kinds 
of interpersonal trauma, namely physical and sexual abuse. This 
is a very preliminary analysis on quite a small sample, so these 
findings might very well not hold. It is introduced here merely to 
illustrate a specific type of gene-environment interaction. It is, 
however, consistent with the mixed evidence that sometimes 
(but not invariably) links DRD2*A1 with susceptibility to trauma 
(Comings et al. 1991, 1999). The implication is that early trauma 
activates the gene, which, through reducing the capacity for 
interpersonal adaptation, makes the individual vulnerable to 
later traumata. We have some evidence consistent with this 
hypothesis. As part of our battery we used Simon Baron-Cohen's 
"reading the mind in the eyes" test (Baron-Cohen 2000). We 
found that subjects with traumatic experiences were less sensi­
tive on this test. Furthermore, when we controlled for mentaliza­
tion using the eyes test score as a covariate, the previously 
observed gene-environment interaction disappeared. This im­
plies that sensitivity to mental states may indeed have been the 
mediator of the selective effect of trauma. Those with the Al 
allele, either as a consequence of trauma or associated with a 
genetic predisposition, had less interpersonal sensitivity and 
showed greater trauma-related impairment in social functioning. 
The Al allele is probably a marker for low dopamine trans­
porter binding, which predicts, among other things, a detached 
personality in healthy subjects (Laakso et al. 2000), vulnerability 
to relapse in alcoholics (Guardia et al. 2000), and social phobia 
(Schneier et al. 2000). It is at least possible to argue that the D2 
alleles provide a marker for a certain kind of interpersonal 
vulnerability. In our sample, the Al allele was, in the absence of 
trauma, coupled with significant elevation of personality dys­
function, but dysfunction associated with trauma was evident in 
the presence of trauma. It is either trauma that leads to the

Finally, an important result has recently been published from 
the Budapest Infant-Parent Study (Lakatos et al. 2000). These 
workers found an association between the DRD4 receptor III 
exon polymorphism and disorganized attachment classification 
in 12-month-old infants. Over the years, considerable evidence 
has linked behavioral problems in both children and adults with 
the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene. In particular, ADHD has 
been implicated (Faraone et al. 1999; LaHoste et al. 1996; Rowe 
et al. 1998; Smalley et al. 1998; Swanson et al. 1998), although 
not all studies concur (Castellanos et al. 1998). The review by 
Swanson and colleagues (Swanson et al. 2000) confirmed the 
likely role of the 7-repeat allele of this gene in making the 
postsynaptic receptor subsensitive, thus possibly reducing the 
efficiency of neural circuits for behavior inhibition. Comings et 
al. (1999) report findings related to impulsive, compulsive, addic­
tive behaviors that indicate a greater complexity than does a sole 
focus on the 7- versus non-7 alleles ofthe DRD4 gene. In view of 
recent findings, which have linked disorganized attachment in 
infancy to clinical conditions in middle childhood, it may be 
particularly important that in this study 71% of the infants 
classified as disorganized were found to have at least one 7-
repeat allele, in contrast with only 29% of the nondisorganized 
group. Thus infants classified as disorganized were more than 
four times more likely to be carrying this allele. 
This finding is consistent with observations that neurological 
(Pipp-Siegel, Siegel, and Dean 1999) and neonatal (Spangler, 
Fremmer-Bombik, and Grossmann 1996) behavioral organiza­
tion may anticipate a disorganized attachment classification. It 
might at first sight seem at odds, however, with the classical 
observation that disorganized infant attachment was linked to 
unresolved loss or trauma in the mother (Lyons-Ruth and 
Jacobovitz 1999; Main and Hesse 1990). A recent prospective 
study led by Pat Hughes confirmed that mothers with a history 
of perinatal bereavement were far more likely to have disorgan-

information, we found that the impact of trauma on adult per­
sonality functioning as measured by Jonathan Hill and col­
leagues' APFA measure (Hill, Harrington, Fudge, Rutter, and 
Pickles 1989) was restricted to the subgroup who had the Al 
allele. However, the effect appeared to be limited to certain kinds 
of interpersonal trauma, namely physical and sexual abuse. This 
is a very preliminary analysis on quite a small sample, so these 
findings might very well not hold. It is introduced here merely to 
illustrate a specific type of gene-environment interaction. It is, 
however, consistent with the mixed evidence that sometimes 
(but not invariably) links DRD2*A1 with susceptibility to trauma 
(Comings et al. 1991, 1999). The implication is that early trauma 
activates the gene, which, through reducing the capacity for 
interpersonal adaptation, makes the individual vulnerable to 
later traumata. We have some evidence consistent with this 
hypothesis. As part of our battery we used Simon Baron-Cohen's 
"reading the mind in the eyes" test (Baron-Cohen 2000). We 
found that subjects with traumatic experiences were less sensi­
tive on this test. Furthermore, when we controlled for mentaliza­
tion using the eyes test score as a covariate, the previously 
observed gene-environment interaction disappeared. This im­
plies that sensitivity to mental states may indeed have been the 
mediator of the selective effect of trauma. Those with the Al 
allele, either as a consequence of trauma or associated with a 
genetic predisposition, had less interpersonal sensitivity and 
showed greater trauma-related impairment in social functioning. 
The Al allele is probably a marker for low dopamine trans­
porter binding, which predicts, among other things, a detached 
personality in healthy subjects (Laakso et al. 2000), vulnerability 
to relapse in alcoholics (Guardia et al. 2000), and social phobia 
(Schneier et al. 2000). It is at least possible to argue that the D2 
alleles provide a marker for a certain kind of interpersonal 
vulnerability. In our sample, the Al allele was, in the absence of 
trauma, coupled with significant elevation of personality dys­
function, but dysfunction associated with trauma was evident in 
the presence of trauma. It is either trauma that leads to the 
expression of the gene that generates pathology, perhaps via the 
reduction of D2 receptors, or else the other alleles mark an

ized infants than were controls. Whereas almost 45% of the 
mothers who had lost their last baby during pregnancy had 
infants classified as disorganized at 1 year, only 20% of the 
control mothers matched for age, SES (socioeconomic status); 
and education did so. Adult attachment interviews collected 
before the birth of the child picked up the risk for disorganiza­
tion. Lack of resolution of mourning mediates the association of 
stillbirth experience and disorganization of the "replacement 
infant" in the Strange Situation. 
But only 62% of the mothers with unresolved AAI classifica­
tion had infants classified as disorganized, although specificity 
was relatively high (over 80% of disorganized infants had unre­
solved mothers). It seems that lack of resolution of mourning 
may be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for disorgani­
zation. Since only a third of the children in the Budapest study 
with the 7-repeat allele showed disorganized attachment, check­
ing for the presence of the 7-repeat allele might, of course, 
explain the discrepancy. It is possible that the abnormalities in 
infant-mother interaction; assumed to be associated with lack of 
resolution of bereavement, may impact more on individuals 
whose mesolimbic dopamine system is functioning less effi­
ciently, for which the 7-repeat allele of the D4 receptor may be a 
marker. The mesolimbic dopamine system has been proposed to 
control behavior motivated by reward (Robbins and Everitt 
1999), and less sensitive D4 dopamine receptors (Van Tol et al. 
1992) could further distort the signal value of the mother's 
response. The review by Swanson and colleagues (Swanson et al. 
2000) suggests that dopamine underactivity compromises atten-
tional systems, which might exaggerate the impact of subtle 
anomalies ofthe mother's behavior in relation to her infant (e.g., 
momentary dissociation, frightened or frightening behavior, 
etc.—see Solomon and George 1999). This is clearly speculative, 
but it is a readily testable hypothesis that is in line with the 
general interactional model that we propose. 
To summarize, we have identified three instances where data 
from molecular biology might be illuminated by study of the 
early family environment, particularly parenting and attach­
ment. In one case, lack-of adequate parenting was clearly linked 
to the penetration of one of the alleles of the 5-HTT gene, caus-A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 121 
ing dysfunction in serotonergic activity. In the second case, 
those whose experience1 included psychological (and physical) 
abuse and the Al allele of the D2 gene showed the greatest 
personality dysfunction. In the third case, a posttraumatic state 
in the mother might possibly interact with another dopamine 
receptor, causing dysfunctional attachment organization and 
subsequent psychological disturbance. All these findings are 
rather tenuous at the moment, but all three are consistent with 
the hypothesis that early experience with the object is formative, 
even for genetically determined predisposition through the trig­
gering of gene expression. Taken together, they suggest quite a 
fruitful line of investigation, which, given the relative facility 
with which samples can be collected and analyzed, might be­
come an important adjunct to most of our work in developmen­
tal psychopathology. 
The Genesis of an Appraisal Mechanism 
So far, we have argued that the importance of family environ­
ment may have been underestimated in behavioral genetics re­
search, for methodological and conceptual as well as empirical 
reasons. We have also tried to construct a primafacie case for a 
representational system that forms an active filter between the 
genotype and the phenotype. In other words, the mental pro­
cessing of experience is critical for the expression of genetic 
material, and therein lie substantial interactions between gene 
and environment. We will now argue that the genesis of the 
representational system that forms an active filter between the 
genotype and the phenotype is intrinsically linked to the quality 
of early object relationships. Perhaps more than shaping the 
quality of subsequent relationships (for which evidence is lack­
ing), the early relationship environment serves to equip the 
individual with a processing system. The creation of this repre­
sentational system is arguably the most important evolutionary 
function for attachment to a caregiver. Adopting this perspective 
helps to redress the prevailing bias against the centrality of the 
family as the major force in socialization, but it also shifts the

or mental mechanism and involves expanding on current ideas 
of the evolutionary function of attachment. 
John Bowlby, a major Darwin scholar (Bowlby 1991), was 
impressed by the obvious selection advantages of infant protest 
at separation—that is, protection from predation (Bowlby 1969). 
Given that phylogenetically and ontogenetically infancy is a pe­
riod of extreme risk, it is unarguable that natural selection would 
favor individuals with a capacity for attachment. There has been 
a revolution in evolutionary theory since Bowlby's time. We now 
realize that "survival of the fittest" cannot guarantee the natural 
selection of a behavior. Only the reproduction of genetic material 
can achieve this (W. D. Hamilton 1964). This is the theory of 
inclusive fitness. One does not need to survive and reproduce 
oneself in order for one's genes to be replicated. For example, 
some organisms will forgo reproduction in order to ensure the 
reproductive potential of their genetically close relatives. The 
concept of "inclusive fitness" places attachment theory at the 
center stage of evolutionary sociobiology as a key behavioral 
mechanism mediating the establishment of genetic proximity, for 
attachment is the process that ensures that we know whose 
survival will advantage the reproduction of our genes. Of course, 
it may have additional evolutionary functions. Freud's (1900a) 
principle of multiple determination works in evolutionary theory 
just as much as in dream Interpretation and symptom genera­
tion. It is possible that attachment marks individuals with whom 
we should not mate because of the biological risks associated 
with interbreeding and incest. Adult attachment may also be a 
marker for reciprocal altruism. Altruism and cooperatlveness 
(Axelrod 1984; Trivers 1971)—the "quid-pro-quo" strategy of 
helping non-kin if, and only if, they have done something for 
one—might also be underpinned by the mechanism of attach­
ment. Attachment is likely to minimize the adverse effects of 
"cheaters"—individuals who do not reciprocate equitably in 
groups over time and to whom we are unlikely to become at­
tached. This would be a good example of a further interesting 
facet of evolution: how a mechanism that evolved for one purpose 
(the protection of the vulnerable infant) may be put to good 
biological use in the context of the adaptive problems of subse­
quent developmental phases. But all these potential biological A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 123 
functions would apply as readily to animal models of attachment 
as to the human infant. If the biological function of attachment is 
to be a pillar in our argument for the importance of parenting, we 
need to restrict ourselves to uniquely human capacities. 
The generally recognized components of attachment be­
haviors that serve to establish and maintain proximity are: {a) 
signals that draw the caregivers to their children (such as smil­
ing), (b) aversive behaviors (such as crying), which perform the 
same function, and (c) skeletal-muscle activity (primarily loco­
motion), which brings the child to the caregiver. But there is a 
fourth component that provides a better evolutionary rationale 
for the entire enterprise of human attachment, going beyond the 
issue of physical protection: (d) according to Bowlby, at about 
the age of 3 years behaviors signifying a goal-corrected partner­
ship begin to emerge. The central psychological processes for 
mediating goal-corrected partnerships are the internal working 
models. 
Bowlby's original concept has been thoughtfully elaborated by 
some of the greatest minds in the attachment field (Bretherton 
1991b; Bretherton and Munholland 1999; Crittenden 1990. 
1994; M. Main 1991; Main et al. 1985; Sroufe 1990, 1996), and 
no attempt to duplicate this will be undertaken here. However, it 
might be helpful to summarize the four representational systems 
that are implied in these reformulations: (a) expectations of 
interactive attributes of early caregivers created in the first year 
of life and subsequently elaborated, (b) event representations by 
which general and specific memories of attachment-related ex­
periences are encoded and retrieved, (c) autobiographical memo­
ries by which specific events are conceptually connected because 
of their relation to a continuing personal narrative and develop­
ing self-understanding, and (d) understanding of the psychologi­
cal characteristics of other people (inferring and attributing 
causal motivational mind states such as desires and emotions 
and epistemic mind states such as intentions and beliefs) and 
differentiating these from those ofthe self. Thus a key develop­
mental attainment of the internal working model is the creation 
of a processing system for the self (and significant others) in 
terms of a set of stable and generalized intentional attributes, 
such as desires, emotions, intentions, and beliefs inferred from

recurring invariant patterns in the history of previous interac­
tions. The child comes to be able to use this representational 
system to predict the other's or the self s behavior in conjunction 
with local, more transient intentional states inferred from a 
given situation. 
Classically, in attachment theory this phase change from 
behavior to representation is generally regarded as a modifica­
tion of the attachment system propelled by cognitive develop­
ment (Marvin and Britner 1999). Our contention here is the 
reverse: rather than seeing the biological role of attachment 
shifting ontogenetically as a consequence of other, biologically 
driven maturational changes, we propose that a major selective 
advantage conferred by attachment to humans was the oppor­
tunity it afforded for the development of social intelligence 
and meaning-making. The capacity for "interpretation," which 
Bogdan defined as "organisms making sense of each other in 
contexts where this matters biologically" (1997, p. 10), becomes 
uniquely human when others are engaged "psychologically in 
sharing experiences, information and affects" (p. 94). The capac­
ity to interpret human behavior—to make sense of each other— 
requires the intentional stance: "treating the object whose be­
havior you want to predict as a rational agent with beliefs and 
desires" (Dennett 1987, p. 15). 
The capacity for interpretation in psychological terms—let us 
call this the "Interpersonal Interpretive Mechanism," or IIM—is 
not just a generator or mediator of attachment experience; it is 
also a product of the complex psychological processes engen­
dered by close proximity in infancy to another human being—the 
primary object or attachment figure. It is not Bowlby's TWM; it is 
just a part of the IWM (Bowlby, 1980) and perhaps Kernberg's 
self-object-affect triad (1983). It does not contain representa­
tions of experiences and is not a repository of personal encoun­
ters with the caregiver. Rather, it is a mechanism for processing 
new experiences, more like Bion's (1962a) alpha function. The 
IIM is closely related to the notion of a "theory of mind"—the 
ability to attribute independent mental states to others in order 
to explain and predict their behavior (Leslie 1987). Earlier in this 
volume, we introduced the concept of reflective function and 
mentalization (chapter 1) to broaden the rather narrow scope 
a A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 125 
and operationalization of the theory-of-mind construct. We see 
the IIM as an overarching hypothetical neural structure, a pro­
cessing system for social information that underlies reflective 
function or mentalization but may have many functions beyond 
these. In the present chapter, we use IIM as the assumed neural 
mechanism that interacts with the genotype to enhance or re­
duce the likelihood of genetic expression. In later chapters, we 
restrict ourselves almost entirely to psychological observations 
and mark this by using the terms "mentalization" or "reflective 
function"—the latter when referring to mentalization as it is 
operationalized in our work. We assume that the quality of 
functioning of the IIM is reflected in the quality of mentalization. 
In chapter 4 we outline how the development of the IIM is 
facilitated by sensitive and attuned early care, and chapter 5 
gives a comprehensive account of the ontogenesis of mentali­
zation as it relates to the formation of the self. 
The IIM may be a final step in the transcription of genetic 
influence into a pattern of behavior, in a way analogous to RNA. 
The interpretive mechanism encodes genetic information in the 
form of biases, but, we would suspect, of a very specific and 
situational character. Interpreting social behavior in one context 
may correlate poorly with understanding of another. For exam­
ple, from the work of Mary Target with Arietta Slade and her 
colleagues on the PDI (Parents Development Interview—Slade, 
Bernbach, Grienenberger, Wohlgemuth-Levy, and Locker, un­
published manuscript), we are finding that parental reflective 
function is specific to each parent-child relationship. In our twin 
study, parents' representation of each twin was independently 
predictive of Strange Situation observation. The IIM, or a mecha­
nism like it, is responsible for the moderation of genetic influence 
by modifying the child's perception of his social environment. 
Thus given a genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior, for 
example, positive behaviors in the family can protect the child 
from becoming antisocial (Reiss et al. 2000), because such posi­
tive behaviors enhance the functioning of the interpersonal 
interpretive mechanism in that child, which, in turn, helps in 
generating less malevolent interpersonal attributions. Of course, 
such warmth may, in turn, be the consequence of inherited 
characteristics in the child, such as physical attractiveness, easy

contexts where this matters biologically" (1997, p. 10), becomes 
uniquely human when others are engaged "psychologically in 
sharing experiences, information and affects" (p. 94). The capac­
ity to interpret human behavior—to make sense of each other— 
requires the intentional stance: "treating the object whose be­
havior you want to predict as a rational agent with beliefs and 
desires" (Dennett 1987, p. 15). 
The capacity for interpretation in psychological terms—let us 
call this the "Interpersonal Interpretive Mechanism," or IIM—is 
not just a generator or mediator of attachment experience; it is 
also a product of the complex psychological processes engen­
dered by close proximity in infancy to another human being—the 
primary object or attachment figure. It is not Bowlby's TWM; it is 
just a part of the IWM (Bowlby, 1980) and perhaps Kernberg's 
self-object-affect triad (1983). It does not contain representa­
tions of experiences and is not a repository of personal encoun­
ters with the caregiver. Rather, it is a mechanism for processing 
new experiences, more like Bion's (1962a) alpha function. The 
IIM is closely related to the notion of a "theory of mind"—the 
ability to attribute independent mental states to others in order 
to explain and predict their behavior (Leslie 1987). Earlier in this 
volume, we introduced the concept of reflective function and 
mentalization (chapter 1) to broaden the rather narrow scope 
a A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 125 
and operationalization of the theory-of-mind construct. We see 
the IIM as an overarching hypothetical neural structure, a pro­
cessing system for social information that underlies reflective 
function or mentalization but may have many functions beyond 
these. In the present chapter, we use IIM as the assumed neural 
mechanism that interacts with the genotype to enhance or re­
duce the likelihood of genetic expression. In later chapters, we 
restrict ourselves almost entirely to psychological observations 
and mark this by using the terms "mentalization" or "reflective 
function"—the latter when referring to mentalization as it is 
operationalized in our work. We assume that the quality of 
functioning of the IIM is reflected in the quality of mentalization. 
In chapter 4 we outline how the development of the IIM is 
facilitated by sensitive and attuned early care, and chapter 5 
gives a comprehensive account of the ontogenesis of mentali­
zation as it relates to the formation of the self. 
The IIM may be a final step in the transcription of genetic 
influence into a pattern of behavior, in a way analogous to RNA. 
The interpretive mechanism encodes genetic information in the 
form of biases, but, we would suspect, of a very specific and 
situational character. Interpreting social behavior in one context 
may correlate poorly with understanding of another. For exam­
ple, from the work of Mary Target with Arietta Slade and her 
colleagues on the PDI (Parents Development Interview—Slade, 
Bernbach, Grienenberger, Wohlgemuth-Levy, and Locker, un­
published manuscript), we are finding that parental reflective 
function is specific to each parent-child relationship. In our twin 
study, parents' representation of each twin was independently 
predictive of Strange Situation observation. The IIM, or a mecha­
nism like it, is responsible for the moderation of genetic influence 
by modifying the child's perception of his social environment. 
Thus given a genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior, for 
example, positive behaviors in the family can protect the child 
from becoming antisocial (Reiss et al. 2000), because such posi­
tive behaviors enhance the functioning of the interpersonal 
interpretive mechanism in that child, which, in turn, helps in 
generating less malevolent interpersonal attributions. Of course, 
such warmth may, in turn, be the consequence of inherited 
characteristics in the child, such as physical attractiveness, easy 

126 / Theoretical Perspectives 
temperament, and so on. Our proposal for environmental influ­
ence does not entail a return to naive environmentalism. 
The Ontogenesis of the IIM 
How is the IIM created out of the secure base? Clearly there 
must be biological preparedness, but in our view this is not 
separable from, the infant's experience ofthe caregiving environ­
ment. In answering this question we are drawing on George 
Gergely and John Watson's model (Gergely and Watson 1996, 
1999). A core proposition in this book is the rejection of the 
notion that the conscious apprehension of our mind states 
through, introspection might be a basic, direct, and probably 
prewired ability of our mind. We do not believe that knowledge of 
the self as a mental agent is innately given. Rather, we see it as a 
developing or constructed capacity that evolves out of the earli­
est relationships. In chapter 4 the developmental roots of our 
model of the apprehension of emotional states is described in 
full, and in chapter 5 some of the problems of the nativist 
intersubjective position are critically considered. In the current 
chapter, we anticipate these arguments with a brief outline of 
the ontogenetic model and focus on the broader implications of 
the assumption of an interpersonal interpretive processing sys­
tem that moderates genetic influences on personality. 
Our core idea is that the attachment context provides the 
setting in which the infant can develop a sensitivity to self-states, 
through what Gergely has termed "psycho-feedback" or social 
biofeedback—a mechanism that is fully described in chapter 4. 
The child acquires this capacity for sensitivity by developing a 
second-order symbolic representational system for motivational 
and epistemic mind states. What initiates the development of 
this representational system is the internalization of the moth­
er's mirroring response of the infant's distress (caregiving 
behavior), which comes to represent an internal state. The moth­
er's empathic emotion provides the infant with feedback on his 
emotional state. The infant internalizes the mother's empathic 
expression by developing a secondary representation of his emo­
tional state, with the mother's empathic face as the signifler and A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 127 
his own emotional arousal as the signified. The mother's expres­
sion tempers emotion to the extent that it is separate and 
different from the primary experience, although crucially it is 
recognized not as the mother's experience, but as an organizer of 
a self-state. It is this "intersubjectivity" that is the bedrock ofthe 
intimate connection between attachment and self-regulation. 
As shown in chapter 5. however, intersubjectivity in this 
context may be a misnomer. At this stage the infant is unaware 
that he is seeing the other's subjective state. It is likely that the 
infant does not yet know that others have internal feelings. At 
this level of human proximity the other's subjective state is 
automatically referred to the self. In infancy the contingent 
responding of the attachment figure does far more than provide 
reassurance about a protective presence. It is the principal 
means by which we acquire understanding of our own internal 
states, which is an intermediate step in the acquisition of an 
understanding of others as psychological entities—the inten­
tional stance. We believe that when relational analysts such as 
the brilliant late Stephen Mitchell (2000) describe intersubjectiv­
ity in the context of therapy, they are invoking this mechanism. 
In the first year the infant only has primary awareness of 
being in a particular internal, emotional state. Such awareness 
is noncausal or epiphenomenal in that it is not put to any 
functional use by the system. It is in the process of psycho-
feedback between infant and mother that these internal experi­
ences are more closely attended to, evolve a functional role (a 
signal value), and acquire a function in modulating or inhibiting 
action. Thus it is attachment processes that ensure the move 
from primary awareness of internal states to functional aware­
ness. In functional awareness a feeling of anger may be used to 
simulate and so to infer the other's corresponding mental state. 
This is achieved not through reflection but by action: the child 
"knows" that acting in a particular way will result in a specified 
outcome but does not need to—or is not yet able to—make the 
further inference that the outcome is a consequence of the 
internal state he generated in the object. Functional awareness 
of internal states can also be used to serve a signal value to 
direct action. The next level of awareness is reflective awareness, 
where the individual can make a causal mind state become the

where the individual can make a causal mind state become the 

128 / Theoretical Perspectives 
object of attention without it causing action. Whereas functional 
awareness is intrinsically coupled with action, reflective aware­
ness is separate from it. It has the capacity to move away from 
physical reality and may be felt to be not for real. A final level is 
autobiographical, where the child is able to place records of 
experiences imbued with psychological states into a sequence 
that represents his history as an individual. These stages of the 
development of self as agent are detailed in chapter 5. 
Many studies provide evidence consistent with this model (see 
chapters 1 and 5). For example, a study mentioned earlier 
showed that the rapid soothing of distressed 6-month-olds could 
be predicted on the basis of ratings of emotional content of the 
mother's facial expression during the process of soothing: moth­
ers of rapid responders showed somewhat more fear, somewhat 
less joy, but most typically a range of other affects in addition to 
fear and sadness. Mothers of rapid responders were far more 
likely to manifest multiple affect states (complex affects). We 
interpreted these results as supporting Gergely and Watson's 
notion of the mother's face being a secondary representation of 
the infant's experience—the same, and yet not the same. This is 
functional awareness with the capacity to modulate affect states. 
A further set of studies performed by Gergely and his col­
leagues in Budapest as well as our laboratory in London and 
with an ongoing replication in Topeka, Kansas, explored 1-year-
olds' understanding of conflicting affect (Koos, Gergely, Gervai, 
and Toth 2000). In one study, 12-month attachment classifica­
tion—particularly secure and disorganized—was found to be pre­
dicted by infant behavior at 6.5 months in a modified still 
paradigm (Koos et al. 2000). The paradigm involves the mother 
being instructed according to the still-face protocol but facing a 
mirror, where the infant has a choice between looking at the 
mother's face or looking at a perfectly contingent image (them­
selves). Infants classified as securely attached engaged six 
months later in significant amounts of active testing of their 
mirror self-image only when their mother became temporarily 
inaccessible.(the still-face period). In contrast, babies who went 
on to manifest disorganized attachment six months later were 
drawn to the image of their fully contingent self movements 
throughout the laboratory testing. Interestingly, the Koos et al. A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 129 
(2000) study also demonstrated that following the still-face pe­
riod the infants who engaged in more contingency testing while 
looking at their self-image showed more positive affect following 
the procedure. This led to more successful affect regulation in 
disorganized infants than in secure ones. Yet seeking for perfect 
contingency in attempts at detecting internal states in the con­
text of human interaction will be of limited effectiveness in the 
long run. It characterizes the dissociative style of attention or­
ganization that is typical of disorganized attachment. 
In chapter 5 we consider the developmental move from a stage 
when the infant seems to prefer stimuli that are perfectly contin­
gent with his actions to a stage when infants indicate greater 
interest in stimuli that only partially mirror their actions, which 
are contingent but clearly not perfectly so. The preference for 
perfect contingency that characterizes the infant of less than 5 
months clearly orients him toward his own physical self. It 
establishes the parameters of his body as proprioceptive and 
provides him with visual experiences that are perfectly contin­
gent, and also contingent with rudimentary volitional states 
related to action. In chapter 5 we argue that the developmental 
step entailed by the preference for high but imperfect contingen­
cies after the age of 5 months turns the human infant toward 
social interaction with his attachment figures. Human beings are 
incapable of responding with perfect contingency. An orientation 
to the social world entails a greater tolerance for imperfect 
contingencies, as the caregiver fails to respond to a high propor­
tion ofthe infant's signals (Tronick 1989, 1998). Notwithstanding 
the biological preparedness for imperfect contingency, the inter­
personal learning environment within which the IIM can develop 
probably requires a minimum level of contingent responding for 
the experience of "nearly, but clearly not the same" to evolve—the 
experience that is undoubtedly key to the creation of inter­
personal symbolic capacity. Disorganized attachment perhaps 
marks the historical absence of an interpersonal context that 
failed to meet the tolerance limits of the infant's capacity 
to absorb imperfect contingency. Thus, the experience of mis-
attunement (or noncontingency), which causes all of us to inter­
nalize an "other within the self" (the part of the self we will be 
calling the "alien self*), goes in some cases beyond what the 

128 / Theoretical Perspectives 
object of attention without it causing action. Whereas functional 
awareness is intrinsically coupled with action, reflective aware­
ness is separate from it. It has the capacity to move away from

infant can tolerate and still feel a sense of coherent, continuous 
identity. For most us, the experience of unresponsiveness 
or inappropriate response can be incorporated within our self-
structure through mentalization, which lends an illusion of co­
herence, normally through creating a narrative self. This coher­
ence becomes a functional reality as we weave incompatible 
experiences together into one identity. Arguably, the nagging 
sense of incongruity and of "loose ends" within the self-structure 
supplies some of the motivation for seeking out further attach­
ment relationships throughout life, in a search for greater 
integration and understanding. For other people, the alien expe­
rience within the self remains an inassimilable core that creates 
an even more powerful need for integration through later attach­
ment relationships but that also gets in the way of forming and 
maintaining such relationships. The vulnerability of reflective 
function may then be compounded by later attachment trauma, 
which, in an effort to restore a feeling of control, may lead to 
identification with the abuser's state of mind. This sequence is 
explored further in chapter 10. 
Evidence for the Interpersonal 
Interpretive Mechanism 
Is there any evidence for an IIM that evolves out of the attach­
ment relationship, with its efficiency conditioned by attachment 
security? 
1. There is unequivocal evidence from two decades of longitudi­
nal research that secure attachment in infancy is strongly asso­
ciated with the precocious development of a range of capacities 
that depend on interpretive or symbolic skills, such as explora­
tion and play, intelligence and language ability, ego resilience 
and ego control; frustration tolerance, curiosity, self-recognition, 
social cognitive capacities, and so on. Attachment security fore­
shadows cognitive competence, exploratory skill, emotion regu­
lation, communication style, and other outcomes. In our view, 
this is not because of the general impact of attachment security A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 131 
on the child's self-confidence, initiative, ego functioning, or other 
broader personality processes but, rather, because attachment 
processes provide the key evolutionarily prepared paths for an 
interpersonal interpretive capacity to develop. 
Thus it is not the first attachments that are formative, it is 
not attachment security per se that predicts good outcome on 
this dazzling array of measures; rather, the features of the 
interpersonal environment that generate attachment security 
during the first year of life also prepare the ground for the rapid 
and competent ontogenetic evolution of interpersonal interpreta­
tion. One problem in attempting to trace some of the long-term 
outcomes of secure attachment in infancy has been the appro­
priately conservative strategy of controlling for numerous as­
pects of this interpretive capacity. Controlling for verbal fluency 
or even IQ removes a part of the variability in which the attach­
ment relationship arguably plays a causal role. But this is an 
issue for another time. 
2. A number of specific findings in the literature link attach­
ment to the development of an IIM. Laible and Thompson (1998) 
reported that securely attached children have higher compe­
tence in understanding negative emotion. A unique study by 
Jude Cassidy and colleagues (Cassidy, Kirsh, Scolton, and Parke 
1996) found that securely attached kindergarteners were less 
likely to infer hostile intent in stories with ambiguous content. 
This bias appeared to mediate their superiority in sociometric 
status. In the London Parent-Child Study Peter Fonagy, Miriam 
and Howard Steele, and Juliet Holder (1997) reported precocious 
performance on theory-of-mind tasks among 5-year-olds with a 
history of secure attachment in infancy. This finding has also 
been reported by other investigators since then (Fonagy 1997; 
Meins et al. 1998). 
3. In a relatively full exploration of findings linking early at­
tachment and later development, Ross Thompson concludes that 
"the strength of the relationship between infant security and 
later socio-personality functioning is modest" (1999, p. 280). The 
associations are stronger contemporaneously than they are pre-
dictively. Within the context of the present theory, it is not the 

130 / Theoretical Perspectives 
infant can tolerate and still feel a sense of coherent, continuous 
identity. For most us, the experience of unresponsiveness

3. In a relatively full exploration of findings linking early at­

"the strength of the relationship between infant security and 
later socio-personality functioning is modest" (1999, p. 280). The 
associations are stronger contemporaneously than they are pre-
dictively. Within the context of the present theory, it is not the 

132 / Theoretical Perspectives 
content of internal working models that is likely to be deter­
mined by early experience; rather, the presence of a model or the 
quality or robustness of the model determines later socio-per-
sonality functioning. Thus, attachment classification might or 
might not be stable from infancy through middle childhood to 
adolescence. As prediction comes from the IIM, not from attach­
ment security per se, this is of no great concern. 
The focus of study should not be attachment security, which 
achieved significance as a correlate of the IIM but has little 
stability and possibly little predictive value. Within the context of 
the present theory, it is not the nature of self-other representa­
tions that is thought to be determined by early experience. 
Rather, the focus of the present enquiry is the extent to which 
early experience may jeopardize the very existence of a structure 
to represent object relationships, the processing skills required 
to deal with interpersonal interaction, the robustness of the 
model, the extent to which this interpretive mechanism can 
function under stress and process emotionally charged informa­
tion, and so forth. The mechanism of predictive significance is 
the interpersonal interpretive mechanism, which is a genetically 
defined capacity that is probably localized in the medial prefron­
tal cortex. Studies of patients with orbital-frontal and medial-
frontal lesions have repeatedly suggested specific deficits in 
tasks that call for thinking about mental states in others (Chan-
non and Crawford 1999, 2000; Stuss, Gallup, and Alexander 
2001). Both PET (positron emission tomography) and fMRI (func­
tional magnetic resonance imaging) studies in which subjects 
were asked to make inferences about the mental states of others 
found activity associated with mentalizing in the medial prefron­
tal cortex. In addition, activity was elicited in the tempero-
parietal junction (Gallagher et al. 2000; Goel, Grafman, Sadato, 
and Hallett 1995). 
There is independent evidence for the developmental vulner­
ability of this structure from PET-scan studies of Romanian 
adoptees who were deprived of the interpersonal experiences 
that we think might generate the IIM (B. Perry 1997). Damage to 
these frontal areas (Adolphs, Tranel, Damasio, and Damasio 
1995; Alexander, Stuss, and Benson 1979; Brazzelli, Colombo, 
Delia Sala, and Spinnler 1994; Channon and Crawford 1999, A Psychosocial Model ofthe Development of Mentalization / 133 
2000; Damasio 1994; Rogers et al. 1999) has been consistently 
associated with social and personality deficits that are consist­
ent with the notion of the loss of interpersonal interpretive 
capacity: impaired social judgments, impaired pragmatics, defi­
cient self-regulation, and impoverished association of social situ­
ations with personal affective markers (e.g., Craik et al. 1999; 
Stuss 1983, 1991). Independently, we know, of course, that the 
attachment classification of these adoptees remains disorgan­
ized at the age of 3 years and their social behavior is abnormal at 
age 8. We also have evidence that the mentalizing capacity of 
individuals maltreated in early childhood continues to have sig­
nificant limitations. 
4. Myron Hofer's work with rodent pups identified regulatory 
interactions within the mother-infant relationship that have 
clear analogies to what is proposed here (Hofer 1995; Polan and 
Hofer 1999). Hofer's work over three decades has revealed that 
the evolutionary survival value of staying close to and interacting 
with the mother goes far beyond protection and may be ex­
panded to many pathways available for regulation of the infant's 
physiological and behavioral system. Hofer's view is analogous to 
ours in that he proposes that the attachment "relationship pro­
vides an opportunity for the mother to shape both the developing 
physiology and the behavior of her offspring through her pat­
terned interactions with her infant" (Polan and Hofer 1999, 
p. 177). Attachment is not an end in itself—it is a system 
adapted by evolution to fulfill key ontogenetic physiological and 
psychological tasks. 
Hofer's reformulation of attachment in terms of regulatory 
processes, hidden but observable within the parent-infant inter­
action, provides a very different way of explaining the range of 
phenomena usually discussed under the heading of attachment. 
The traditional attachment model is clearly circular. The re­
sponse to separation is attributed to the disruption of a social 
bond, the existence of which is inferred from the presence ofthe 
separation response. We argue that what is lost in "loss" is not 
the bond but the opportunity to generate a higher-order regula­
tory mechanism: the mechanism for appraisal and reorganiza­
tion of mental contents. We conceptualize attachment as a 

132 / Theoretical Perspectives 
content of internal working models that is likely to be deter­
mined by early experience; rather, the presence of a model or the 
quality or robustness of the model determines later socio-per-
sonality functioning. Thus, attachment classification might or 
might not be stable from infancy through middle childhood to 
adolescence. As prediction comes from the IIM, not from attach­
ment security per se, this is of no great concern. 
The focus of study should not be attachment security, which 
achieved significance as a correlate of the IIM but has little 
stability and possibly little predictive value. Within the context of 
the present theory, it is not the nature of self-other representa­
tions that is thought to be determined by early experience. 
Rather, the focus of the present enquiry is the extent to which 
early experience may jeopardize the very existence of a structure 
to represent object relationships, the processing skills required 
to deal with interpersonal interaction, the robustness of the 
model, the extent to which this interpretive mechanism can 
function under stress and process emotionally charged informa­
tion, and so forth. The mechanism of predictive significance is 
the interpersonal interpretive mechanism, which is a genetically 
defined capacity that is probably localized in the medial prefron­
tal cortex. Studies of patients with orbital-frontal and medial-
frontal lesions have repeatedly suggested specific deficits in 
tasks that call for thinking about mental states in others (Chan-
non and Crawford 1999, 2000; Stuss, Gallup, and Alexander 
2001). Both PET (positron emission tomography) and fMRI (func­
tional magnetic resonance imaging) studies in which subjects 
were asked to make inferences about the mental states of others

all, such mental function is unique to humans. The mechanisms 
that generate these (attachment relationships) show evolution­
ary continuity across nonhuman species. Just as in rat pups the 
ontogenetic development of biological regulators crucially de­
pends on ,the mother-infant unit, so in human development 
psychological interpretive capacity evolves in the context of the 
repetitive interactions with the mother. 
5. In a series of studies at the Menninger Clinic we explored the 
factor structure of a number of self-report measures of adult 
attachment. On both community and clinical samples we found 
very similar results across three investigations. In the first study 
(Allen et al. 2000), two measures of adult attachment style—the 
Relationship Questionnaire (Bartholomew and Horowitz .1991) 
and the Adult Attachment Scale (Collins and Read 1990)—were 
administered-to 253 individuals (99 female trauma patients and 
154 community controls). The factor space provided a reason­
able two-dimensional solution with a secure-fearful axis and a 
dismissive-preoccupied axis.2 We found the same two factors—a 
secure-fearful axis and a dismissive-preoccupied axis—in a rep­
lication study by Stein and colleagues, which used five adult 
attachment-questionnaire measures, again on a mixed popula­
tion1; When we plotted the subjects in the sample—both patients 
and community controls—on the same two principal compo­
nents, it was clear that while the secure-fearful axis was excel­
lent at distinguishing the community sample from the patient 
group, the dismissive-preoccupied axis did not distinguish the 
groups well. What was also clear was a somewhat unexpected 
relationship between component scores. Although the overall 
correlation between the two scales was negligible, as you would 
expect, the discrimination between dismissive and preoccupied 
was somewhat greater toward the middle point of the secure-
fearful dimension. 
2 In a principal-component analysis, a two-component solution accounted 
for all eigen values greater than 1 and for 67.2% ofthe total variance. A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 135 
One way of interpreting these data is to assume that security 
represents an experience of safety in closeness, whereas fearful-
ness relates to a disorganization of attachment. The fearfulness 
appears to be specific to attachment relationships, as non-
attachment relationships rarely score highly on this dimension. 
The dismissing attachment style appears to offer protection to 
the self by isolation, whereas in enmeshed preoccupation self-
protection is'perhaps afforded by an amplification of the other, 
by a denial or subjugation ofthe self. 
We would argue that the safety-to-fearfulness dimension cor­
responds to the quality of functioning ofthe IIM. At the high end, 
the individual is well able to represent complex internal states of 
the other and of the self. With a well-established higher-order 
capacity for distinguishing psychological states of the other and 
the self, they need no additional strategies for conducting 
productive interpersonal relationships. When the psychological 
mechanism crucially underpinning attachment is somewhat 
weaker (as a function of attachment history or biology), the 
capacity for sustaining a clear distinction between self and other 
also becomes weaker. In such a situation the individual will 
require specific strategies to accommodate to interpersonal en­
counters. The-two prototypical strategies are the avoidant and 
resistant strategies. 
But why are such strategies necessary? Both serve to protect 
the self in the context of intense interpersonal relations. We 
assume that these strategies may be necessary because the 
self, which is, as we have seen, the product ofthe other, always 
remains vulnerable to social influence. To avoid such instability, 
against a background of a relatively insecure internal working 
model, the individual can either deliberately withdraw and en­
hance the self-representation relative to the other representa­
tions (dismissing) or protectively overamplify and exaggerate the 
other representation (preoccupied). In either case, the strategies 
in representational terms are about deliberately separating the 
other from the self-representation. 
Neither of these strategies is inherently pathological, al­
though both signal a certain degree of weakness. At the extreme 
end of the safety-to-fearfulness dimension, there can be no

strategy because the attachment system is not there to sustain a 
consistent set of defenses. In these cases the interpretive mecha­
nism that sustains social relations functions so poorly that the 
capacity to arrive at representations of the motivational or epi-
stemic mind states of the other, independent of those of the self, 
is profoundly compromised. This is attachment disorganization 
or, rather, the absence of the mental function that sustains 
attachment. Thus we conceive of attachment disorganization as 
lying at the opposite end of the scale to attachment security and 
as an indicator of the regular failure of the interpersonal inter­
pretive mechanism. As we argue throughout this book, we con­
sider the quality of interpretive capacity to vary substantially 
across normal and clinical groups. At the low end of this scale 
are individuals who use a teleological rather than an intentional 
stance in interpreting their own and others' behavior (see chap­
ters 5 and 8). As we shall see, the reasons for this weakness 
might be linked to early suboptimal environments that could 
create a vulnerability through undermining the robustness of 
the IIM (see particularly chapter 4) or the failure to appropriately 
integrate developmentally early forms of representations for sub­
jectivity (see chapter 6) due, for example, to a lack of playful 
interactions with parents or frank maltreatment at much later 
ages (see chapters 10 and 11). 
To summarize, we feel that there are at least five strands of 
converging evidence to suggest that a key selective advantage 
of attachment might be the development of an understanding of 
internal states: (a) that secure attachment is associated with 
favorable outcomes across a wide range of relevant tasks; (b) that 
secure attachment predicts precocious performance in tasks 
specifically calling for symbolic capacity; (c) that the class of 
early attachment classification has less predictive weight than 
whether attachment experiences occurred; (d) that attachment 
has been demonstrated to have other ontogenetic biological func­
tions in mammalian species that have analogies or may parallel 
the evolutionary function for attachment proposed here; (e) that 
the factor structure of adult attachment scales separates out a 
factor to do with type of attachment (perhaps the internal work­
ing model) and the quality of attachment (perhaps the interper­
sonal interpretive mechanism). A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 137 
THE NEURO-ANATOMICAL BASIS OF IIM-a AND IIM-c 
So far we have discussed the IIM as if we thought of it as a 
singular and unitary system. In chapter 5 we present evidence 
that the acquisition of an understanding of desires might ante­
date the acquisition of a capacity to understand epistemic states 
(such as beliefs) by as much as 18 months. This discrepancy in 
the developmental timetable suggests that separate mechanisms 
for interpersonal understanding concerning emotions and belief 
states should be considered. In this section we present some 
neuropsychological evidence that points in the same direction. 
We believe that the IIM subdivides anatomically into two sub­
structures: the IIM-a (a for affect) and the IIM-c (c for cognition). 
Emotional resonance (empathy) may exemplify the former, while 
reasoning about epistemic states might be prototypical of the 
latter. The term "theory of mind" or "mentalization" as currently 
used covers both these aspects, although there is a bias in the 
literature toward equating mentalization with the understanding 
of belief states. 
The concept of empathy has been variously defined. In this 
context the availability of a mechanism that allows one indi­
vidual to assume another's perspective and to infer and, to some 
degree, experience their emotional state of mind is central. We 
believe that the psychological mechanism that we have labeled 
the IIM-a is responsible for this (Bleiberg, Fonagy, and Target 
1997; Fonagy 2000). Other workers have independently come to 
very similar theoretical conclusions (Blair 1995; Corcoran 2000). 
Darwin considered sympathy to be the core moral emotion as 
it involved the automatic experiencing of the other's distress, 
which gives rise to altruistic attempts to offer comfort or relief 
(O'Cormell 1998). 
Neurophysiological studies support the distinction. The pure­
ly cognitive task of identifying belief states in the other has been 
associated with activation of medial prefrontal foci around BA8 
using SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) 
(Baron-Cohen et al. 1994), PET (Blair, Jones, Clark, and Smith 
1997; Goel et al. 1995) and fMRI (Gallagher et al. 2000). The 
infant's understanding of his own emotional responses (by defi­
nition, a precursor of empathy) itself arises out of a complex

specific gene expression. Knowledge of these mechanisms would 
help us sharpen our intervention strategies and may prompt us 
to advance new modes of prevention or treatment intervention. 
We would suggest that at least some psychosocial treatments, 
like psychoanalysis, or preventive efforts, like affect training—for 
example, the PATHS Program (Kusche and Greenberg 2001)— 
work because they enhance the functioning of the IIM and 
moderate gene expression. Of course, by enhancing mentaliza-
tion, social adaptation in general might also be enhanced. In 
either case, we maintain that attachment-related early social 
experiences of other minds are necessary for this to take place 
because the normal functioning of interpersonal interpretive 
processes requires simultaneous access to epistemic and affec­
tive information. Most probably, social experience in an attach­
ment context in developmental periods of neural plasticity 
enhances connections between what we assume to be the ana­
tomically separate but functionally normally integrated affective 
and cognitive structures. This is why effective psychotherapy, 
particularly with individuals whose capacity for mental repre­
sentations of internal states is vulnerable, must focus on affect 
as well as cognition, be delivered in an interpersonal context that 
permits the development of attachment relationships, and meet 
a criterion for coherence that is consistent with the requirement 
of repetition of stimuli in the generation of neural networks (e.g., 
Rumelhart and McClelland 1986) and the switching-on of spe­
cific genes (Kandel 1998, 1999). 
Perhaps, further into the future, we may envision the meas­
urement of the outcome of psychosocial interventions by track­
ing changes in the expression of specific genes in specific sites 
relevant for the development of psychopathology (the brain, en­
docrine organs, etc.). More realistically, suitability for specific 
types of treatment may be determined in terms of genetic vari­
ability. In the meantime, we can measure the impact of interven­
tions on measures that might tap,into the IIM (the RF scale, the 
"reading the mind in the eyes" test). A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 141 
CONCLUSIONS 
Though what is proposed here may sound radical, when closely 
scrutinized it actually contains very little that is new. We suggest 
that psychoanalysis needs to look to the cognitive neurosciences 
to find its intellectual fulfillment. Current theorization in neuro-
science is sadly devoid of considerations of emotional life and 
relationality even around topics such as social development, 
where the subject matter directly concerns the child's subjectiv­
ity. Happily, there are a number of energetic initiatives under­
way that pursue this path for knowledge acquisition (e.g., Solms 
1997a, 1997b), and a new journal, Neuro-Psychoanalysis, offers 
a ready forum for these developments. 
The evidence clearly shows that it is naive to assume that the 
child's genotypic destiny is fulfilled in a hermetically sealed 
brain, somehow isolated from the social environment within 
which ontogeny occurs and the sound adaptation to which is the 
organizing purpose of the whole system. Subjectivity, the under­
standing of the individual response, will be an essential piece in 
putting together the microbiological puzzle of genetic expression. 
Psychoanalysis, with its focus on the representation of subjectiv­
ity and how this emerges from early development, might have 
much to contribute to the understanding of how individual dif­
ferences in the quality of functioning of basic mental mecha­
nisms arise. We are suggesting that infant attachment functions 
—In part at least—to facilitate the development of an interper­
sonal interpretive capacity. The quality of the early relationship 
plays a major role in determining the robustness of that capacity, 
but attachment security per se is less relevant to later develop­
ment. The interpretive capacity, in turn, plays a key role in the 
processing of social experience. The level of functioning of the IIM 
will be reflected in an individual's ability to function in close 
interpersonal relationships without recourse to strategies for 
amplifying the distinction between self and other representa­
tions. The unfolding of disturbance over time is conditioned by 
the interpretive capacity—we speculate that the expression of 
pathogenic genotypes is made more likely by the poor function­
ing of a mechanism designed to differentiate the psychological 
states of self and other.

help us sharpen our intervention strategies and may prompt us 
to advance new modes of prevention or treatment intervention. 
We would suggest that at least some psychosocial treatments, 
like psychoanalysis, or preventive efforts, like affect training—for

tion, social adaptation in general might also be enhanced. In 
either case, we maintain that attachment-related early social 
experiences of other minds are necessary for this to take place 
because the normal functioning of interpersonal interpretive 
processes requires simultaneous access to epistemic and affec­
tive information. Most probably, social experience in an attach­
ment context in developmental periods of neural plasticity 
enhances connections between what we assume to be the ana­
tomically separate but functionally normally integrated affective 
and cognitive structures. This is why effective psychotherapy, 
particularly with individuals whose capacity for mental repre­
sentations of internal states is vulnerable, must focus on affect 
as well as cognition, be delivered in an interpersonal context that 
permits the development of attachment relationships, and meet 
a criterion for coherence that is consistent with the requirement 
of repetition of stimuli in the generation of neural networks (e.g.,

cific genes (Kandel 1998, 1999). 
Perhaps, further into the future, we may envision the meas­
urement of the outcome of psychosocial interventions by track­
ing changes in the expression of specific genes in specific sites 
relevant for the development of psychopathology (the brain, en­
docrine organs, etc.). More realistically, suitability for specific 
types of treatment may be determined in terms of genetic vari­
ability. In the meantime, we can measure the impact of interven­
tions on measures that might tap,into the IIM (the RF scale, the 
"reading the mind in the eyes" test). A Psychosocial Model of the Development of Mentalization / 141 
CONCLUSIONS 
Though what is proposed here may sound radical, when closely 
scrutinized it actually contains very little that is new. We suggest 
that psychoanalysis needs to look to the cognitive neurosciences 
to find its intellectual fulfillment. Current theorization in neuro-
science is sadly devoid of considerations of emotional life and 
relationality even around topics such as social development, 
where the subject matter directly concerns the child's subjectiv­
ity. Happily, there are a number of energetic initiatives under­
way that pursue this path for knowledge acquisition (e.g., Solms 
1997a, 1997b), and a new journal, Neuro-Psychoanalysis, offers 
a ready forum for these developments. 
The evidence clearly shows that it is naive to assume that the 
child's genotypic destiny is fulfilled in a hermetically sealed 
brain, somehow isolated from the social environment within 
which ontogeny occurs and the sound adaptation to which is the 
organizing purpose of the whole system. Subjectivity, the under­
standing of the individual response, will be an essential piece in 
putting together the microbiological puzzle of genetic expression. 
Psychoanalysis, with its focus on the representation of subjectiv­
ity and how this emerges from early development, might have 
much to contribute to the understanding of how individual dif­
ferences in the quality of functioning of basic mental mecha­
nisms arise. We are suggesting that infant attachment functions 
—In part at least—to facilitate the development of an interper­
sonal interpretive capacity. The quality of the early relationship 
plays a major role in determining the robustness of that capacity, 
but attachment security per se is less relevant to later develop­
ment. The interpretive capacity, in turn, plays a key role in the 
processing of social experience. The level of functioning of the IIM 
will be reflected in an individual's ability to function in close 
interpersonal relationships without recourse to strategies for 
amplifying the distinction between self and other representa­
tions. The unfolding of disturbance over time is conditioned by 
the interpretive capacity—we speculate that the expression of 
pathogenic genotypes is made more likely by the poor function­
ing of a mechanism designed to differentiate the psychological 
states of self and other. 

142 / Theoretical Perspectives 
This is a function of immense importance, as the laborious 
move from genotype to phenotype is conditioned in this way. A 
full understanding of the interaction between individual mental-
ized representations of life experience and the expression of 
genetic dispositions is the task of the developmental psychopa-
thology of the next decades. Eric Kandel (1998)'cites Francois

p. 152). PART II 
DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVES 
In Part II, we present a comprehensive picture of the development 
of a psychological sense of self, beginning with infancy and 
ending with adolescence. In chapter 4 we introduce the social 
biofeedback view of mirroring, a precise account of the mecha­
nisms through which infants learn to identify and control affect 
states through interaction with primary caregivers—moving from 
coregulation to being self-regulating agents. The social biofeed­
back view of mirroring is a fundamental extension of psychoana­
lytic theory; it is important not just as an account of normal 
development but as a basis for explaining later vulnerability to 
psychosocial stress and psychopathology. (This is made evident 
in the case material in chapter 7.) Chapter 5 moves on to delin­
eate five distinct aspects of the self: physical, social, teleological, 
intentional, and representational—which is also autobiographi­
cal. The notion of the intentional stance—and its relation to the 
teleological stance—borrowed from the philosophy of mind is 
particularly important to our point of view, as it spells out how we 
learn to fathom ourselves through fathoming others. We make the 
case here for the central importance of intersubjectivity once it 
urfolds in early development However, we criticize currently 
popular arguments that intersubjectivity is present from the start

continues the developmental sequence: it highlights the dialectic 
between "psychic equivalence" (that mental reality must map 
onto physical reality) and "pretend" (that mental and physical 
reality are completely separate from each other)—two modes of 
childhood experience that become integrated through "playing 
with reality," leading to the appreciation that the mind only par­

the usefulness of these concepts to the understanding of a young 
boy whose disturbed relationship with his mother resulted in the 
distortion of these developmental processes. Chapter 8 focuses 
on the processes underpinning normal and pathological stresses 
in adolescence and presents case material illustrating serious

of Emotional Self-Awareness

In many ways this chapter forms the core of our thinking about 
the role of affects in self-development—a theoretical and concep­

chapter by placing the construct of emotions within the frame­
work of the development of intentionality and mentalization, the 
concepts that lie at the core of our theoretical and clinical work. 
We then focus on the nature of the developmental processes 
involved in the emergence of understanding of emotions in self 
and other. The development of emotions during the first year of 
life is outlined and placed in the context of one of the organizing 
concept^ of this book: the infant's sensitivity to contingencies 
between his actions and their perceived environmental effects. 
We describe the social biofeedback theory of emotional develop­
ment, which we see as the key to understanding the link be­
tween early experience and later vulnerability to psychosocial 
stress. We also point briefly to a number of pathological modes of 
early infant-careglver interaction that could give rise to later 
psychological disturbance and the vulnerability of the self as 
agent. Chapter 5 then attempts to integrate the particular view 
of emotional development described in this chapter within our

EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
FROM A THEORY-OF-MIND PERSPECTIVE 
During the last decade philosophers (Dennett 1987; Fodor 1987, 
1992) and cognitive developmentalists (Astington, Harris, and 
Olson 1988; Baron-Cohen et al. 1993; Hirschfeld and Gelman 
1994; Perner 1991; Wellman 1990; Whiten 1991) have focused 
on the nature and developmental origins of our capacity to 
attribute causal mental states to others. Dennett (1987) has 
argued that applying such a mentalistic interpretational strat­
egy, which he calls the "intentional stance," is an evolutionary 
adaptation that is highly successful in predicting the behavior 
of other agents. Thus, the currently dominant cognitive de­
velopmental view holds that even young children are so-called 
belief-desire psychologists who attribute intentional mental 
states—such as goals, emotions, desires, and beliefs—to others 
as the causes of their actions. 
Researchers take different views, however, when they address 
the question of how children identify and attribute mind states 
to others or to themselves. Simulation theorists (e.g., Goldman 
1993; P. L. Harris 1991, 1992) assume that humans have direct 
introspective access to their own mental states, while they have 
to infer those of others indirectly through imagining themselves 
in their place and then attributing the simulated mental experi­
ence to the other. In contrast, others (Dennett 1987; Gopnik 
1993; Gopnik and Wellman 1994) argue that direct perceptual 
access to mind states is illusory, and they propose that the 
identification of mental states is equally inferential in the case of 
self and other. 
When do children take the intentional stance and start to 
infer mind states In other agents? While the attribution of appar­
ently more complex intentional states, such as false beliefs, 
generally appear only at around 3-4 years of age (see chapter 5 
for a comprehensive developmental account of the emergence of 
this ability—Perner 1991; Wellman 1990; Wimmer and Perner 
1983), many (e.g., Brethertoh 1991a; Stern 1985; Tomasello 
1999) believe that certain new behaviors emerging during the 
last quarter of the first year, such as pointing and gaze alteration 
(E. Bates .1979; Bretherton and Bates 1979; Murphy and Messer Serial Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 147 
1977) or social referencing (Campos and Stenberg 1981; Klin-
nert, Campos, Sorce, Emde, and Svejda 1983), imply the appear­
ance of a rudimentary ability on the infant's part to attribute at 
least some kinds of mind states—such as attention states or 
emotions—to other agents. In a series of habituation studies, 
Gergely, Csibra, and their colleagues (Csibra, Gergely, Brock-
bank, Biro, and Koos 1999; Gergely et al. 1995) have provided 
evidence that 9- and 12-month-old infants can, indeed, interpret 
an agent's behavior as goal-directed and rational and can predict 
its future action toward the goal in a new situation on that basis. 
However, 6-month-olds showed no signs yet of such an under­
standing of intentional behavior, which is in line with the gen­
eral assumption that the earliest time in development when 
infants may be able to take the "intentional stance" toward other 
agents is around the end of the first year (Tomasello 1995, 
1999). 
The "theory-of-mind" perspective is clearly relevant when we 
consider the origins of the infant's ability to understand and 
attribute emotional states to others. While much of the discus­
sion in the theory-of-mind literature has concentrated on beliefs 
and desires, it should be clear that emotions also belong to the 
types of intentional mental states that we attribute to other 
minds to explain and predict their behavior. In fact, emotions 
share many of the representational properties that characterize 
intentional mental states. The "intentionality" of mental states 
such as beliefs and desires refers to their "aboutness" (Brentano 
1874; Dennett and Haugeland 1987)—thus, a belief is "about" an 
actual or possible state of affairs in the world, whereas a desire 
is "about" a future state of affairs. Clearly, in that sense emo­
tions are also mental attitudes that are "about" some state of 
affairs (as when Peter is angry about having lost his wallet1) and 
attributing that information to a person can certainly help to 
explain or predict his behavior. 
1 That emotions belong to the class of Intentional mental states is also shown 
by the fact that emotion terms, similarly to other "intentional idioms," express 
propositional attitudes and are characterized by the semantic property of "refer­
ential opacity" (Dennett and Haugeland 1987; Quine 1960). This property refers 
to the fact that certain logical operations, such as substitutability of terms with

However, when attributing an emotion to someone, one also 
attributes dispositional information that is related more to-the 
attitude itself than to the intentional object that the attitude is 
about. Attributing "anger about having lost his wallet" to Peter 
allows one to generate a set of predictions about his future 
behavior that are only incidentally related to what his anger is 
about—for example, predicting that Peter is likely to kick the dog 
if he sees it. The dispositional information that emotions express 
specifies that under certain circumstances a person who is in 
the given dispositional emotion state is likely to behave in cer­
tain ways rather than in others. In other words, it specifies a set 
of potential states of affairs that can be propositionally described 
in terms of a set of "if-then" conditional statements. When we 
attribute an emotion state to someone, we must be able to 
generate at least some of these conditional states of affairs in our 
mind, otherwise we would not be able to infer anything about the 
person's future behavior.2 
Therefore, from a theory-of-mind perspective the central 
questions of the psychology of emotional development would be 
the following: {a) How do infants come to know about the dis­
positional content of emotions? (b) How do they identify what an 
emotion state is about? (c) When do they start to attribute either 
kinds of information to other minds to support reasoning about 
behavior? (d) How do they learn the conditions under which the 
attribution of emotions to others—or, for that matter, to them­
selves—is justified? 
In the latter regard, we should note that emotions differ in 
interesting ways from other intentional mental states such as 
beliefs and desires. First, emotions may be easier to infer in 
another person, because they tend to be accompanied by sali-
identical referents, break down in the case of expressions involving intentional 
relations such as "x believes that p" or "y desires that q." Thus, while the 
statement "Oedipus was angry about Laius's comments" is true, it does not 
follow that "Oedipus was angry about his father's comments" is also true, even 
though "Laius" and "Oedipus's father" refer to the same individual. 
2 In fact, apart from their dispositional content, we often exploit other types of 
knowledge as well when we reason about emotions—for example, knowledge 
about the typical causes of emotions or about the typical consequences of acting 
emotionally (Watson 1995). Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 149 
ent—and, in the case of basic emotions, possibly universal— 
expressive facial displays (Ekman 1992; Ekman, Friesen, and 
Ellsworth 1972; Izard 1977). Also, having an emotion seems to 
involve specific and differential changes in physiological arousal 
(at least, in the case of some basic emotions—see Ekman, Leven-
son, and Friesen 1983), as well as a characteristic subjective 
feeling state, which, it can be argued, makes correct self-attribu­
tion relatively easy. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting 
that there may be a set of basic emotions that is universal and 
innate (Ekman 1992; Ekman et al. 1972; Izard 1977, 1978). On 
the basis of these considerations it seems plausible to ask 
whether emotions are among—if not the—earliest mental states 
that infants attribute to minds (cf. Meltzoff and Gopnik 1993), 
IMITATION-BASED ATTRIBUTION OF EMOTIONAL 
STATES: THE MELTZOFF-GOPNIK HYPOTHESIS 
Meltzoff and Gopnik (1993) proposed that innate mechanisms 
allow the infant to attribute emotional states to others from the 
beginning of life. Their theory is based on Meltzoff s extended 
work (Meltzoff and Moore 1977, 1989) demonstrating an innate 
ability and inclination in newborn babies to imitate certain facial 
gestures of adults—such as tongue protrusion and mouth open­
ing—and maybe also the components of some of the basic 
facial emotion expressions (Field, Woodson, Cohen, Garcia, and 
Greenberg 1983). Additionally, their model assumes the exist­
ence of an innate set of primary emotions that are expressed by 
prewired facial muscular action patterns (Ekman 1992b; Ekman 
etal. 1972; Izard 1977, 1978). 
Based on Ekman et al.'s (1983} findings with adults, Meltzoff 
and Gopnik suggest that there are prewired bidirectional con­
nections between facial emotion expressions and corresponding 
differential physiological emotion states, which are active from 
birth. Thus, they embrace a basic assumption of differential 
emotions theory (Izard 1977; Izard and Malatesta 1987; Mala^ 
testa and Izard 1984), according to which "there is an innate 
expression-to-feeling concordance in the young infant" (Mala-

activates, through these prewired connections, the correspond­
ing bodily emotion state in himself. In their words, "imitation of 
behavior provides the bridge that allows the internal mental 
state of another to 'cross over' to and become one's own experi­
enced mental state" (Meltzoff and Gopnik 1993, p. 358). Accord­
ing to Meltzoff and Gopnik, the imitation-generated emotion 
state is then introspectively accessed, and the felt affect is attrib­
uted to the other's mind. 
However, there is no direct evidence to support the assump­
tion that discrete innate emotion displays automatically activate 
emotion-specific conscious feeling states in early infancy. In fact, 
several researchers explicitly reject this possibility, arguing that 
affect states are likely to be undifferentiated during the first few 
months of life and that the appearance of differentiated con­
scious feeling states is the consequence of cognitive development 
(e.g., Sroufe 1979). Lewis and Michaelsoh (1983) argue that, 
during the earliest phases of infancy, internal states and expres­
sive behaviors are not yet coordinated and that conscious feeling 
states that are linked to discrete expressive displays emerge only 
later due to the influence of socialization and cognitive growth 
(see also Kagan 1992; Lewis and Brooks 1978). 
In addition to embracing the—as yet unsupported—innatist 
assumption of an initial linkage between emotion expressions 
and specific feeling states, the Meltzoff-Gopnik model must make 
a further nativist assumption to account for the ensuing attribu­
tion of the imitation-generated emotion state to the other's mind. 
Without that, the proposed imitation-mediated emotional conta­
gion process would generate an emotion state in the infant that 
would match the adult's expressed affect, but the process would 
stop there, and no mental-state attribution would occur. Accord­
ingly, Meltzoff and Gopnik go on to argue that "one fundamental 
assumption of mentalism—that external, visible behaviors are 
mapped onto phenomenologically mental states—is apparently 
given innately" (1993, p. 340). This assumption of "primary 
intersubjectivity" is extensively scrutinized in chapter 5. 
But even if one were to accept the innatist set of assumptions 
of the Meltzoff-Gopnik model; there would still remain a ques-Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 151 
tion concerning the nature of the imitation-generated affect state 
that seems crucial from the point of view of the theory-of-mind 
approach to emotional development. Apart from experiencing a 
differential phenomenological quality, is it proposed that the 
baby becomes aware of the dispositional content of the emotion 
state as well—not to mention its aboutness? It is not clear 
whether Meltzoff and Gopnik (1993) conceive of the dispositional 
content of emotions as also genetically specified, but it is clear 
that without making that strong innatist assumption, attribut­
ing pure—uninterpreted—physiological feeling states to the 
other would not serve the vital evolutionary function of the 
"intentional stance": it would not help the infant in predicting the 
other's behavior. 
Finally, a central assumption of the Meltzoff-Gopnik model is 
the proposition that from the beginning of life infants have direct 
introspective access to their internal emotion states. However, 
the viability of the classical Cartesian position, according to 
which the mental states of the self are accessed directly through 
(infallible) introspection while those of the other have to be 
inferred on the basis of indirect evidence, has been a matter of 
lively debate in the theory-of-mind literature. (See chapter 5 for a 
detailed criticism of this Cartesian assumption.) In fact, Gopnik 
(1993) herself argued forcefully that in development, under­
standing of mind states in the other and in the self appears 
simultaneously and is based on-similar inferential processes in 
both cases. (See also Dennett 1987, chapter 4.) In contrast, for 
the case of emotions, the Meltzoff-Gopnik (1993) model implies 
innately given direct introspective access to the affective states of 
the self. Below we argue, however, that emotions should not be 
considered a special case in this respect. We propose an alterna­
tive view, according to which the infant in his initial state is not 
yet sensitive to the groups of internal-state cues that are indica­
tive of discrete emotion categories. 
In sum, it seems that the Meltzoff-Gopnik model, while intel­
lectually intriguing and based on some important insights, is 
heavily burdened with innatist assumptions, some of which, we 
believe, might be avoided in accounting for the developmental 
lines leading to the understanding and attribution of emotions in 
infancy. In what follows, we outline an alternative approach to

152 / Developmental Perspectives 
conceptualizing early emotional development, which, while per­
haps more parsimonious, is, admittedly, equally speculative. 
INITIAL SENSITIVITY 
TO INTERNAL VERSUS EXTERNAL STIMULI 
We believe that there is no compelling reason to assume that the 
dispositional contents of emotion states are available to the 
infant at birth. This is, of course, not to deny the potential 
presence of innate primary emotions, which can be conceptual­
ized as complex prewired behavioral organizations activated un­
der specific input conditions. Such emotion programs are likely 
to contain information about the goal—such as removal of obsta­
cle—and: the specific action tendencies—for example, approach 
and attack—characteristic of the given emotion (anger), which 
could be used to support at least some predictions about likely 
actions. However, we assume that this information is repre­
sented in an implicit form as procedural knowledge, and as such 
it is at first cognitively inaccessible to.the infant. 
Instead, we propose that the dispositional content of emotions 
is learned first by observing the affect-expressive displays of 
others and associating them with the situations and behavioral 
outcomes that accompany these emotion expressions. Of course, 
if Meltzoff and Gopnik are right in assuming that the infant has 
direct introspective access to his innate primary emotion states, 
such perceptual learning could be based on monitoring the 
emotional states of the self as well as those of others. 
In assuming that the infant's initial state is characterized by 
direct introspective access to internal states, Meltzoff and Gop7 
nik (1993) follow the tradition of a long line of developmental 
theorists. For example, Freud and other psychoanalysts (e.g., 
Mahler et al. 1975) have long held the view that the infant 
is initially more sensitive to internal than to external stimuli. 
Bruner, Olver, and Greenfield (1966) also proposed that the 
infant moves from an initial reliance on internal, proprioceptive 
cues to a reliance on exteroceptive cues (see also Birch and Lef-
ford 1967; Gholson 1980; for a review, see Rovee-Collier 1987). Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 153 
However, as Colombo, Mitchell, Coldren, and Atwater (1990) 
have pointed out, there are practically no empirical data in the 
infant learning literature to support this classical assumption 
directly. In contrast, in a series of experiments designed to 
test the assumption, these authors have demonstrated that 
3-month-olds show discrimination learning on the basis of exte­
roceptive as well as interoceptive cues.3 Moreover, in 6- and 
9-month-olds they actually found dominance of the exterocep­
tive over the interoceptive cues in learning. 
Therefore, it seems to us that it might be worthwhile to 
explore the consequences of abandoning the classical assump­
tion concerning the presumed dominance of internal stimuli in 
the initial state of the infant. In fact, we hypothesize that at the 
beginning of life the perceptual system is set with a bias to attend 
to and explore the external world and builds representations pri­
marily on the basis of exteroceptive stimuli. In this view, then, the 
set of internal—visceral as well as proprioceptive—cues that are 
activated when being in and expressing an emotion state are, at 
first, not perceived consciously by the infant, or, at least, are not 
grouped together categorically in such a manner that they could 
be perceptually accessed as a distinctive emotion state.4 
This raises the question; How, on the basis of this theory, 
does the infant develop awareness of and conie to represent the 
sets of internal-state cues as indicating categorically distinct 
3 Note furthermore that'one cannot rule out the possibility that the position 
cues in Colombo et al.'s (1990) study, which were based on eye fixation, might 
have been computed on the basis of the position of the nose, which is, in fact, an 
exteroceptive cue, see Bower (1974). 
4 As will become apparent, our proposal does not necessarily imply—while 
being compatible with—the more radical view that at the beginning of life infants 
are lacking any kind of awareness of their internal states. It is possible that the 
infant has some awareness of the component stimuli that belong to the groups of 
internal-state cues that are indicative of categorical emotions, but only as part of 
the "blooming, buzzing confusion" (W. James, 1890) of internal sense impres­
sions he may experience. Such state cues may also contribute to the overall— 
positive or negative—hedonic quality of the infant's awareness. Our—less 
radical—suggestion is (a) that the groups of internal-state cues that are indica­
tive of dispositional emotion states are initially not perceptually accessible as 
distinct feeling states, and (b) that the infant's perceptual system is at the start 
set with a bias to actively explore and categorize external rather than internal 
stimuli.

emotion states? We propose that the species-specific human 
propensity for the facial and vocal reflection of the infant's 
emotion-expressive displays during affect-regulative interactions 
plays a crucial role in this developmental process. Below we 
identify a number of significant developmental consequences of 
the instinctive human inclination to expose infants to affect-
reflective behavioral displays during emotion-regulative interac­
tions. We also argue that all of these consequences are mediated 
by the same underlying mechanism—namely, contingency de­
tection and maximizing. Before describing our model, however, 
let us briefly review the available empirical evidence on the role 
and nature of affect-regulative interactions during emotional 
development in the first year of life. 
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE 
During the last thirty years we have witnessed the accumulation 
of a large body of compelling evidence in developmental psychol­
ogy that has radically changed our conceptualization of the 
initial state of the infant. While not so long ago the standard view 
held that at the beginning of life infants are basically passive, 
undifferentiated, diffuse organisms surrounded by a stimulus 
barrier (e.g., Mahler et al. 1975), it is now generally accepted 
that they are equipped from the start with remarkably rich 
perceptual, learning, and representational capacities and spe­
cific preparedness for the structure of the physical and social 
world around them (Bower 1974; Emde 1988; Gergely 1992; 
Meltzoff 1990; Stern 1985). \ 
This change of perspective has certainly also characterized 
recent research on early emotional development (Ekman 1992a; 
Ekman and Oster 1979; Izard 1977; Izard and Malatesta 1987; 
Malatesta et al. 1989; Tronick and Cohn 1989), which assumes a 
strong biosocial preparedness for emotion expression and emo­
tional communication in infancy. Following Darwin's (1872) 
early insight, recent cross-cultural research on facial emotion 
expressions (Ekman 1992b; Ekman et al. 1972; Izard 1977, Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 155 
1978) has indicated that there is a set of innate basic emotions— 
including, at least, enjoyment, anger, fear, sadness, disgust, and 
surprise—that are expressed by the same facial muscular action 
patterns across cultures and are universally recognized. Young 
infants have been reported to make nearly all the muscle move­
ments that are used by adults to express the primary emotions 
(Ekman and Oster 1979; Oster 1978), and the facial expressions 
of interest, joy, disgust, surprise, and distress have been identi­
fied in young babies (Izard 1978). Furthermore, the facial mus­
cular actions involved in the expression of at least some of the 
universal emotions have been shown in adults to generate spe­
cific and differential physiological arousal patterns characteris­
tic of the given emotion (Ekman et al. 1983). 
Based on findings such as these, numerous psychologists 
embraced the view that basic emotions are innate dynamic 
behavioral organizations with adaptive functions, characterized 
by specific facial display patterns that are connected through 
prewired activation channels to differential physiological re­
sponse structures (Ekman 1992b; Ekman and Oster 1979; Izard 
1977, 1978; Izard and Malatesta 1987; Malatesta et al. 1989; 
Meltzoff and Gopnik 1993). 
Furthermore, the currently dominant biosocial view of emo­
tional development holds that mother and infant form an affec­
tive communication system from the beginning of life (Beebe, 
Jaffe, and Lachmann 1992; Bowlby 1969; Brazelton, Kowslow-
ski, and Main 1974; Hobson 1993; Sander 1970; Stern 1977, 
1985; Trevarthen 1979; Tronick and Cohn 1989) in which the 
mother plays a vital interactive role in modulating the infant's 
affective states. While young infants do have some rudimentary 
means of affective self-regulation—such as turning away from 
overarousing stimuli or thumb-sucking (Demos 1986; Malatesta 
et al. 1989)—there is agreement that the quality of maternal 
interactions exerts a strong regulative influence on the infant's 
affective state changes (Field 1994; Malatesta and Izard 1984, 
1989; Tronick, Ricks, and Cohn 1982). Mothers are generally 
rather efficient in reading their infants' emotion displays, and 
sensitive mothers tend to attune their own affective responses to 
modulate their infants' emotional states (Malatesta et al. 1989; 
Tronick and Cohn 1989). There is also some evidence that in-

156 / Developmental Perspectives 
fants can perceptually differentiate at least some facial emotion 
expressions early in life (Field et al. 1983; Malatesta and Izard 
1984), though whether the basis of this discrimination is the full 
expressive pattern seems questionable before 4 months of age 
(see C. Nelson 1987). Studies using the still-face procedure 
(Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, and Brazeltoh 1978) or delayed-
feedback techniques (Murray and Trevarthen 1985; see also 
Nadel, Carchon, Kervella, Marcelli, and Reserbat-Plantey 1999; 
Bigelow and DeCoste, in press) suggest that young infants are 
sensitive to the contingency structure of face-to-face interaction 
and, at least after 3 months of age, are actively searching 
to reestablish such a .pattern of communication when being 
abruptly deprived of it. By using time-based microanafytic meth­
ods (e.g., Gottman 1981) to examine the structure of face-to-face 
interactions, several researchers provided evidence for the early 
existence of bidirectional influence of behavior and mutual regu­
lation of affective communication between mothers and infants 
(Beebe, Jaffe, Feldstein, Mays, and Alson 1985; Beebe and Lach-
mann 1988; Cohn and Tronick 1988; Tronick, Als, and Brazelton 
1977; Tronick and Cohn 1989). Bytfie age of 6 months, infants' 
emotional expressions are already well organized and are 
systematically related to environmental events (Weinberg and 
Tronick 1996). There is evidence that imitative matching activity 
is frequent during mother-infant interactions (Uzgiris, Benson, 
Kruper, and Vasek 1989), and mother-infant pairs have been 
shown to increase their degree of coordination in terms of match­
ing and synchrony with infant age (Tronick and Cohn 1989). 
Maternal imitative behavior has been shown to evoke more smil­
ing and vocalization than nonimitative responses in 3Vfe-month-
old babies (Field, Guy, and Umbel 1985). 
A number of infant researchers (e.g., Beebe and Lachmann 
1988; Papousek and Papousek 1987, 1989; Stern 1985; Trevar­
then 1979; Tronick et al. 1982) have proposed that facial and 
vocal mirroring of affective behavior may be a central feature of 
parental affect-regulative interactions during the first year. In 
line with this view, it has been reported (Malatesta, Culver, 
Tesman, and Shepard 1989; Malatesta and Izard 1984) that 
mothers react with differential facial attunements to infants' 
emotion expressions, and are more likely to imitate their baby's Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 157 
categorical emotion displays than their more "random" facial 
movements—such as twitches or half-smiles. Infants' expres­
sions of sadness and anger have been observed to produce 
affective responses of sadness and anger in their mothers 
(Tronick 1989), and maternal reactions to negative affect include 
mock expressions of negative affect (Malatesta and Izard 1984). 
Research on the facial and vocal interaction between de­
pressed mothers and their infants (Bettes 1988; Cohn, Matias, 
Tronick, Connell, and Lyons-Ruth 1986; Tronick 1989) has 
shown that there is a decrease in the number of contingent 
affective interactions as well as more intrusiveness and more 
negative affect expression on the part of the mother. Further­
more, such infants' affective and regulatory reactions as well as 
their later security of attachment have been found to be related 
to the affect and behavior of their depressed mothers (Field 1994; 
Field et al. 1988; Murray 1992; Pickens and Field 1993; Tronick 
1989). 
In general, such findings seem to support the view of psycho­
analytic theorists who have long identified the maternal mirror­
ing function as an important causal factor in early emotional 
and personality development (e.g., Bion 1962a, 1962b; Jacob-
son 1964; P. F. Kemberg 1984; Kohut 1971, 1977; Mahler and 
McDevitt 1982; Mahler et al. 1975; Winnicott 1967). However, 
the exact nature of the causal mechanism mediating such effects 
has not yet been identified. 
In sum, the reviewed findings indicate that infants during 
their first year of life [a] show an innate tendency to express their 
emotion states automatically, (b) are sensitive to the contingency 
structure of face-to-face affective communication, (c) can dis­
criminate, discrete facial patterns of emotion expression, (d) are, 
to a large extent, dependent on their parent's affect-regulative 
interactions as a means of emotional self-regulation, and (e) the 
quality of their affective states and their emerging self-regulative 
reactions are strongly influenced by the characteristics of their 
parents' affective communicative behavior. 
Toward the end of the first year, however, one can witness the 
emergenceof a set of qualitatively new communicative behavior­
al competencies that, seem to indicate a new level of emotional 
awareness and control as well as the beginning of understand-

156 / Developmental Perspectives 
fants can perceptually differentiate at least some facial emotion 
expressions early in life (Field et al. 1983; Malatesta and Izard 
1984), though whether the basis of this discrimination is the full 
expressive pattern seems questionable before 4 months of age 
(see C. Nelson 1987). Studies using the still-face procedure 
(Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, and Brazeltoh 1978) or delayed-
feedback techniques (Murray and Trevarthen 1985; see also 
Nadel, Carchon, Kervella, Marcelli, and Reserbat-Plantey 1999; 
Bigelow and DeCoste, in press) suggest that young infants are 
sensitive to the contingency structure of face-to-face interaction 
and, at least after 3 months of age, are actively searching 
to reestablish such a .pattern of communication when being 
abruptly deprived of it. By using time-based microanafytic meth­
ods (e.g., Gottman 1981) to examine the structure of face-to-face 
interactions, several researchers provided evidence for the early 
existence of bidirectional influence of behavior and mutual regu­
lation of affective communication between mothers and infants 
(Beebe, Jaffe, Feldstein, Mays, and Alson 1985; Beebe and Lach-
mann 1988; Cohn and Tronick 1988; Tronick, Als, and Brazelton 
1977; Tronick and Cohn 1989). Bytfie age of 6 months, infants' 
emotional expressions are already well organized and are 
systematically related to environmental events (Weinberg and 
Tronick 1996). There is evidence that imitative matching activity 
is frequent during mother-infant interactions (Uzgiris, Benson, 
Kruper, and Vasek 1989), and mother-infant pairs have been 
shown to increase their degree of coordination in terms of match­
ing and synchrony with infant age (Tronick and Cohn 1989).

158 / Developmental Perspectives 
ing, attributing, and reasoning about emotional states. One of 
the first signs of voluntary control over emotion expressions is 
shown by the behavior of avoidant (A-type) infants in the Strange 
Situation (Ainsworth et al. 1978) at 1 year of age. These babies 
seem to suppress the automatic expression of separation-in­
duced negative affect, whose presence is indicated by an in­
crease in heart rate (Sroufe and Waters 1977b) as well as in 
Cortisol level (Spangler and Grossmann 1993). There is also 
evidence (Demos 1986; Malatesta et al. 1989) of some degree of 
affect modulation through control of facial musculature emerg­
ing during the second year of life. 
Another early form of instrumental self-regulation of affective 
behavior is indicated by the emergence of social referencing by 
the end of the first year (e.g., Campos and Stenberg 1981; 
Klinhert et al. 1983). At this time infants who find themselves in 
an ambiguous situation and cannot decide among several 
behavioral alternatives^such as whether or not to crawl across 
a visual cliff to their mother—tend to examine their parent's 
facial emotion display and use the emotional information ex­
pressed to modulate their own behavior. The exact mechanism 
underlying social referencing is as yet unclear. A number of 
different interpretations have been proposed. Some would prefer 
to explain the phenomenon as a simple case of operant condi­
tioning (Barresi and Moore 1996; Gewirtz and Pelaez-Nogueras 
1992; Moore and Corkum 1994), while others argue that it is one 
of the first signs of the infant's emerging theory of mind as it 
involves inferring and attributing a mind state to the parent 
(Bretherton 1991a; Stern 1985). It seems also possible that the 
infant, who is by now well-trained in emotion-regulative mirror­
ing interactions, is actively seeking out a clarifying affect-mirror­
ing cue from the parent that will strengthen and bring one of his 
current conflicting emotion states to dominance, thereby resolv­
ing his indecision. This would be an interesting case of active 
instrumental use of parental emotional communication for self-
regulative purposes. 
Social referencing appears simultaneously with other novel 
forms of intentional communication involving the voluntary ma­
nipulation of the other's attentional state (Bretherton and Bates 
1979; Bates, Benigni, Bretherton, Camaioni, and Volterra 1979; Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 159 
Carpenter, Nagell, and Tomasello 1998; Moore and Corkum 
1994; Murphy and Messer 1977; Tomasello 1995, 1999). These 
include pointing and gaze-following as well as protodeclarative 
gestures such as object-showing. 
The emerging ability at the end of the first year to reason 
about behavior on the basis of an attributed emotion state is 
demonstrated by a study by Spelke, Phillips, and Woodward 
(1995), who showed that while 8-month-olds were not yet able to 
infer a person's next behavior on the basis of her gaze direction 
and facial emotion expression, 12-month-old infants could al­
ready do so. Thus, 1-year-old babies are not only able to dis­
criminate discrete emotion expressions of others, but are also 
able to make inferences on the basis of the dispositional content 
of the emotion displayed. 
It seems, therefore, that by the end of the first year infants 
can already do something more than simply "be in" an emotion 
state and react in an affective way to other people's emotion 
displays: they are able to attribute emotions to others and use 
that information to reason about their behavior. This seems to 
imply that infants are already able to represent the dispositional 
content of at least some basic-emotion states in a cognitively 
accessible form. We wish to argue that this level of representa­
tion of emotions is qualitatively different from the primary-level, 
implicit, procedural representations of prewired automatisms of 
the basic emotions.

sented implicitly, embedded in procedures, and is unavailable to

are inflexible and perceptually driven, and they operate outside 
consciousness. In contrast, deliberative or controlled processes 
refer to voluntary and conscious operations that are flexible and 
modifiable, can be governed by higher-order cognitive goals, and 
can override automatisms. 
In this framework, the infant's primary emotions can be 
conceived of as prewired, stimulus-driven, dynamic behavioral 
automatisms over which he has no control at first. Affect regula­
tion is carried out mainly by the caregiver who, reading the 
infant's automatic emotion expressions, reacts to them with 
appropriate affect-modulating interactions. In this view, emo­
tional self-control will become possible with the establishment of 
secondary control structures that (a) monitor, detect, and evalu­
ate the primary-level dynamic affective - state changes of the or­
ganism, and (b) can inhibit or modify the emotional reaction if 
the anticipated automatic affective response would jeopardize 
higher-order cognitive plans. 
Therefore, a precondition for the voluntary control and self-
regulation of primary affective states is that the level of delibera­
tive processes be informed about the ongoing dispositional state 
changes of the organism that take place at the level of automa­
tized processes. Within this framework, consciously felt emo­
tions can be conceived of as signals that inform the level 
of deliberative processes about the automatic affective state 
changes of the organism. 
As the secondary representations of primary affect states 
become established, they will be subject to a process of represen­
tational elaboration as a result of the learning processes linking 
emotion expressions with types of situations and characteristic 
behavioral outcomes. At this point, the dispositional content of 
emotions, which comes to be encoded in the secondary represen­
tational structures, becomes cognitively accessible and can serve 
as the basis for action prediction when the emotion state is 
attributed to the self or the other. 
As we develop below our account of the various functions 
served by-parental mirroring of affects, we propose that mirror-Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 161

secondary emotion representations by the end of the first year

THE SOCIAL BIOFEEDBACK MODEL 
OF PARENTAL AFFECT-MIRRORING 
Earlier we hypothesized that the internal-state cues that are 
activated when being in an emotion state are initially not per­
ceived consciously or, at least, do not form a categorical group 
that could be perceptually accessed as a distinctive emotion 
state. Now we wish to propose that the repetitive presentation of 
an external reflection of the infant's affect-expressive displays 
serves a vital "teaching" function that results in gradual sensi­
tization to the relevant internal-state cues as well as to the 
identification of the correct set of internal stimuli that corre­
spond to the distinctive emotion category that the baby is in. As 
a result of this process the infant will eventually come to develop 
an awareness of the distinctive internal cues that are indicative 
of categorical emotion states and will become able to detect and 
represent his particular dispositional emotion states. 
One may, of course, ask in what way the presentation of an 
external emotion display that is contingent on the baby's on-line 
internal affect state would lead to the sensitization to and recog­
nition of the internal state that was not consciously accessible 
before. Furthermore, is there any evidence that would indicate 
that such externally induced sensitization to internal states is 
possible? 
In fact, we can point to at least one intriguing example of 
such a process, which shows a high degree of family resem­
blance to the current proposal, namely biofeedback training 
procedures (e.g., Dicara 1970; Miller 1969, 1978). In such stud­
ies continuous measurements are made of the ongoing state 
changes of some internal stimulus state to which the subject 
initially has no direct perceptual access, such as blood pressure. 
The internal-state changes are mapped onto an external stimu-

which covaries with that of the internal stimulus. Repeated 
exposure to such an externalized representation of the internal 
state eventually results in sensitization to—and in certain cases

We hypothesize that the psychological mechanism involved in 
affect-mirroring is the same process as that demonstrated in 
biofeedback training procedures. Our proposal is that parental 
affect-mirroring provides a kind of natural social biofeedback 
training for the infant that plays a crucial role in emotional 
development, and that the underlying learning mechanism that 
mediates the influence of both affect-mirroring and biofeedback 
training is that of contingency detection and contingency maxi­
mizing [see Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999; see also Lewicka 
1988; Watson 1972, 1979, 1985, 1994). Before developing this 
hypothesis in detail, let us, therefore, briefly summarize what is 
known about the mechanism of contingency detection and its 
role in infant development. 
THE CONTINGENCY-DETECTION MODULE: 
CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS AND MAXIMIZING IN INFANCY 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that young infants are 
highly sensitive to the contingent relations between their physi­
cal responses and consequent stimulus events (e.g., Bahrick and 
Watson 1985; Field 1979; Lewis, Allessandri, and Sullivan 1990; 
Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 1979; Papousek and Papousek 1974; 
Rochat and Morgan 1995; Watson 1972, 1994). For example, 
Watson (1972) has shown that 2-month-olds increase their rate 
of leg kicking when it results in a contingent event (the move­
ment of a mobile), but not when they experience a similar but 
noncontingent event. In fact, the detection of causal control over 
the mobile's movement proved positively arousing for these in­
fants. After some experience with the contingency, they started 
to smile and coo at the contingent mobile. In a similar paradigm, 
Lewis and colleagues (1990) also demonstrated that when 2-Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 163 
month-olds detect that their previously experienced contingent 
control over a stimulus event no longer holds, they express 
frustration and distress. 
How do young infants perceive response-stimulus contingen­
cies so efficiently? Based on Watson's extensive studies (Watson 
1979, 1985, 1994), Gergely and Watson (1999) have recently 
proposed the existence of an innate contingency-detection module 
that analyses the probability structure of contingent relations 
between responses and stimulus events. Watson (1979, 1994) 
has provided evidence that the infant's contingency-detection 
device applies two independent mechanisms for analyzing the 
conditional probability structure of contingent response-stimu­
lus events: one looks forward in time, registering the conditional 
probability of an upcoming stimulus event as a function of an 
emitted response, called the "sufficiency index," while the other 
tests backward in time, monitoring the relative likelihood that a 
given stimulus event was preceded by a given response, called 
the "necessity index." The two separate indices estimate two 
aspects of the contingency relation that can vary independently 
of each other, providing a scale of different magnitudes of contin­
gent relatedness. 
To illustrate: imagine that the infant's right leg is attached by 
a string to a mobile, which moves whenever the baby kicks with 
his leg. Thus, the conditional probability of the infant's response 
resulting in the stimulus event is 1.0 (sufficiency index). If the 
mobile always moves when the infant kicks but never in the 
absence of a kick (which makes the "necessity index" also 1.0), 
the infant is in perfect contingent control over the mobile's 
movements. Imagine, however, that half of the mobile's move­
ments are induced by the wind or by the experimenter, who has 
another string attached to the mobile. In this case, checking 
backward in time for the presence of a leg kick preceding the 
mobile's movement will produce only a conditional probability of 
0.5 (necessity index), while the sufficiency index will remain 
perfect at 1.0. Thus, even though the infant's response contin­
ues to be fully effective in bringing about the stimulus event, his 
overall degree of control over the mobile's movements is reduced. 
Such a situation is, in fact, rather typical of the baby's relation-

162 / Developmental Perspectives 
lus equivalent directly observable to the subject, the state of 
which covaries with that of the internal stimulus. Repeated 
exposure to such an externalized representation of the internal 
state eventually results in sensitization to—and in certain cases 
subsequent control over—the internal state. 
We hypothesize that the psychological mechanism involved in 
affect-mirroring is the same process as that demonstrated in 
biofeedback training procedures. Our proposal is that parental 
affect-mirroring provides a kind of natural social biofeedback 
training for the infant that plays a crucial role in emotional 
development, and that the underlying learning mechanism that 
mediates the influence of both affect-mirroring and biofeedback 
training is that of contingency detection and contingency maxi­
mizing [see Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999; see also Lewicka 
1988; Watson 1972, 1979, 1985, 1994). Before developing this 
hypothesis in detail, let us, therefore, briefly summarize what is 
known about the mechanism of contingency detection and its 
role in infant development. 
THE CONTINGENCY-DETECTION MODULE: 
CONTINGENCY ANALYSIS AND MAXIMIZING IN INFANCY 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that young infants are 
highly sensitive to the contingent relations between their physi­
cal responses and consequent stimulus events (e.g., Bahrick and 
Watson 1985; Field 1979; Lewis, Allessandri, and Sullivan 1990; 
Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 1979; Papousek and Papousek 1974; 
Rochat and Morgan 1995; Watson 1972, 1994). For example, 
Watson (1972) has shown that 2-month-olds increase their rate 
of leg kicking when it results in a contingent event (the move­
ment of a mobile), but not when they experience a similar but 
noncontingent event. In fact, the detection of causal control over 
the mobile's movement proved positively arousing for these in­
fants. After some experience with the contingency, they started 
to smile and coo at the contingent mobile. In a similar paradigm, 
Lewis and colleagues (1990) also demonstrated that when 2-Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 163 
month-olds detect that their previously experienced contingent 
control over a stimulus event no longer holds, they express 
frustration and distress. 
How do young infants perceive response-stimulus contingen­
cies so efficiently? Based on Watson's extensive studies (Watson 
1979, 1985, 1994), Gergely and Watson (1999) have recently 
proposed the existence of an innate contingency-detection module 
that analyses the probability structure of contingent relations 
between responses and stimulus events. Watson (1979, 1994) 
has provided evidence that the infant's contingency-detection 
device applies two independent mechanisms for analyzing the 
conditional probability structure of contingent response-stimu­
lus events: one looks forward in time, registering the conditional 
probability of an upcoming stimulus event as a function of an 
emitted response, called the "sufficiency index," while the other 
tests backward in time, monitoring the relative likelihood that a 
given stimulus event was preceded by a given response, called 
the "necessity index." The two separate indices estimate two 
aspects of the contingency relation that can vary independently 
of each other, providing a scale of different magnitudes of contin­
gent relatedness. 
To illustrate: imagine that the infant's right leg is attached by 
a string to a mobile, which moves whenever the baby kicks with 
his leg. Thus, the conditional probability of the infant's response 
resulting in the stimulus event is 1.0 (sufficiency index). If the 
mobile always moves when the infant kicks but never in the 
absence of a kick (which makes the "necessity index" also 1.0), 
the infant is in perfect contingent control over the mobile's 
movements. Imagine, however, that half of the mobile's move­
ments are induced by the wind or by the experimenter, who has 
another string attached to the mobile. In this case, checking 
backward in time for the presence of a leg kick preceding the 
mobile's movement will produce only a conditional probability of 
0.5 (necessity index), while the sufficiency index will remain 
perfect at 1.0. Thus, even though the infant's response contin­
ues to be fully effective in bringing about the stimulus event, his 
overall degree of control over the mobile's movements is reduced. 
Such a situation is, in fact, rather typical of the baby's relation-

ship to his social environment: even the most responsive parent 
will not be able to pick up the baby (stimulus event) every time 
the infant cries (response) (thus reducing sufficiency), and there 
will be occasions when she picks the baby up even though he 
was not crying (which reduces necessity). 
We need one more piece of information about the workings of 
the contingency-detection module before we can turn back to the 
question of affect-mirroring. Watson (1979) argued that when­
ever the two indices of contingent control are unequal, it is 
always possible that the infant has failed to detect the true 
degree of control he has over the stimulus event. Imagine, for 
example, that the response class that the infant is monitoring is 
"kicking with either leg." Let us assume, however, that the 
mobile is tied to the baby's right leg only and so it moves 
whenever the infant kicks with his right leg but does not move 
otherwise. Given that the infant kicks equally frequently with 
either leg, he would find that a leg kick results in mobile move­
ment only half of the time, setting the sufficiency index at 0.5. 
The necessity index, however, will be 1.0, since every mobile 
movement is preceded by a (right-) leg kick. 
Therefore, whenever the necessity index is higher than the 
sufficiency index, it is always possible that the response class 
monitored is too wide, and by reducing it the infant may discover 
that he is exerting more control over the stimulus event than 
previously estimated. In our example, if the infant goes on to 
reduce the response class examined to that of "kicking with the 
right leg," he will raise the sufficiency index higher, and the two 
indices will match, indicating perfect control over the mobile's 
movements. In general, then, whenever the necessity index is 
higher than the sufficiency index, it is a good strategy for the 
infant to reduce the response class examined in order to discover 
the maximal degree of contingent control he actually has over 
the stimulus event. (This works in the opposite direction as well: 
when the sufficiency index is higher than the necessity index, it 
is necessary to expand the response class examined to maximize 
the contingency.) 
Watson (1979) argues that the infant may, in fact, be able to 
apply such a fancy contingency-maximizing strategy by actively Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 165 
experimenting with reducing or extending the response category 
examined as a function of the unequal degree of contingent 
control indicated by the sufficiency versus the necessity index. 
His finding that the rate of responding is highest when both the 
sufficiency and the necessity index are reasonably high and 
equal is in line with this hypothesis. (For further details of the 
contingency-detection and -maximizing model and the support­
ing evidence, see Gergely and Watson 1996; Watson 1972, 1979, 
1994.) 
Up to now we have described the workings of the contin­
gency-detection module only in relation to temporal contingency. 
However, though much of the evidence for this mechanism has 
come from studying purely temporal contingencies, there are, in 
fact, three separate and independent bases of contingency: tem­
poral sensory relational (relative intensity), and spatial (similar­
ity of spatial distribution or pattern) (Watson 1984). This is 
especially relevant when we consider the case of affect-mirroring 
(see below), as such parental displays are contingently related to 
the infant's emotion-expressive behavior not only in terms of 
temporal contingency, but also in terms of relative intensity and 
similarity of pattern. (See also Stein's 1984, 1985, views on 
"affect attunement," which we critically discuss below.) 
Correspondingly, Gergely and Watson (1999) argue that the 
contingency-detection module is an analytic device that at its 
input end monitors for and then registers all the three param­
eters of contingency in parallel and computes as its output an 
overall value indicating the estimated degree of causal related-
ness between responses and stimuli. There is converging evi­
dence that infants use all three informational bases in 
contingency detection. (For a review, see Gergely and Watson 
1999, pp. 103-107.)

THE DEVELOPMENTAL FUNCTIONS 
OF CONTINGENCY DETECTION 
Differentiation of the Self 
Watson (1994, 1995) proposed that one of the primary functions 
of the contingency-detection mechanism is self-detection. One's 
motor actions produce stimuli that are necessarily perfectly 
response-contingent (e.g., watching one's hands as one is mov­
ing them), while the perception of stimuli emanating from the 
external world typically show a lesser degree of response-contin­
gency. Therefore, the detection of the degree of contingency 
between efferent (motor) activation patterns and consequently 
perceived stimuli may serve as the original criterion for distin­
guishing the self from the external world. 
In a seminal study Bahrick and Watson (1985; see also Rochat 
and Morgan 1995; Schmuckler 1996) have demonstrated that 
infants can use their perception of perfect contingency between 
their physical actions and the consequent feedback for self-
detection and self-orientation as early as at 3 months of age. In a 
series of experiments 5- and 3-month-old infants were seated on 
a high chair in front of two monitors in such a way that they 
could freely move their legs. One monitor presented a live image 
of the subject's moving legs, providing a visual stimulus that was 
perfectly contingent with the infant's responses. The other moni­
tor presented a previously recorded image of the infant's moving 
legs, which was, therefore, not contingent with the baby's present 
movements. Five-month-olds clearly differentiated between the 
two displays, looking significantly more at the noncontingent 
image. A number of other preferential looking studies (Lewis and 
Brooks-Gunn 1979; Papousek and Papousek 1974; Rochat and 
Morgan 1995; Schmuckler 1996) in which the live image of the 
self was contrasted with the moving but noncontingent image of 
another baby also indicate that 4- to 5-month-old infants differ­
entiate self from other on the basis of response-stimulus contin­
gencies and prefer to fixate away from the self. 
Interestingly, Bahrick and Watson (1985) found that for 
3-month-olds the distribution of preference was significantly Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 167 
bimodal: one subgroup preferred the perfectly contingent image, 
whereas the other preferred the noncontingent image. Field 
(1979) also reported a preferential visual orientation in her sam­
ple of 3-month-olds toward the perfectly contingent self-image as 
opposed to a noncontingent image. Piaget's (1936) observation 
that during the first months of life cyclic repetitions of actions on 
the self, which he called "primary circular reactions," dominate 
also suggests an initial phase of preoccupation with perfect 
response-stimulus contingencies. Based on such data, Watson 
(1994, 1995) proposed that during the first two to three months 
the contingency-detection module is genetically set to seek out 
and explore perfectly response-contingent stimulation. Watson 
hypothesizes that this initial attention bias serves the evolution­
ary function of developing a primary representation of the bodily 
self as a distinct object in the environment by identifying those 
stimuli that are the necessary sensory consequences of the 
body's motor actions and over which the infant exercises perfect 
control. Referring to the results of connectionist simulations 
teaching a computer net to guide a mechanical arm in accurate 
reaching for objects (Jordan and Rumelhart 1991), Watson 
(1995) suggests that an initial phase of self-seeking behavior 
may be a necessary preparatory stage for the later capacity to 
cope with the environment. 
Orientation toward Social Objects 
Watson (1994) further hypothesized that at around 3 months, 
due to maturational factors, the preferred target value of the 
contingency-detection mechanism is "switched" to high but im­
perfect degrees of (social) contingencies typically provided by the 
reactions of attachment figures attuned to the infants' affective-
communicative displays. In support of this hypothesis, in further 
studies Watson (1979, 1985) demonstrated that when tested on 
a range of different degrees of contingencies, 4- to 6-month-olds 
were most motivated to engage moderately high contingencies 
while failing with very low or near-perfect contingency mag­
nitudes. The hypothesized "switch" at 3 months resulting in an

month-olds and the other subgroup of their 3-month-olds (whose

the (necessarily less-than-perfectly response-contingent) paren­

CONTINGENCY DETECTION AS THE MECHANISM 
UNDERLYING BIOFEEDBACK TRAINING 
AND PARENTAL AFFECT-MIRRORING 
We propose that one of the functions of the contingency-detec­
tion mechanism outlined above is to mediate the sensitization to 
internal-state cues that is brought about as a result of biofeed­
back training (Dicara 1970; Miller 1969, 1978). In biofeedback, 
subjects are instructed to try to monitor for an internal target 
state—say, blood pressure—whose state changes are contin­
gently related to the presence or absence of an externally pre­
sented stimulus equivalent. Changes in the target state will 
result in a set of consequent changes in the subject's internal 
(interoceptive and proprioceptive) states and will possibly induce 
peripheral, externally perceptible state changes as well. This set 
of internal and external stimulus cues will exhibit contingent 
variation not only with the internal target state that is causing 
them, but also with the external feedback stimulus that covaries 
with the internal target state. Let us assume that whenever the 
external feedback cue is on, the subject will carry out a contin­
gency analysis backward in time (the necessity index) scanning 
for the presence of internal and .behavioral responses that were 
present before the onset of the "teaching" stimulus—that is, the 
external biofeedback cue. Furthermore, the subject will also 
monitor for the contingent effects of the sampled set of internalr 
and external-state cues forward in time (the sufficiency index), Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 169 
testing to what degree they predict the appearance of the exter­
nal biofeedback stimulus. By gradually expanding or reducing 
the set of state cues considered to be associated with the target 
state as a function of the direction of inequality between the 
necessity versus the sufficiency indices of contingent control 
(contingency maximizing), the subject will eventually identify the 
set of internal and external-state cues that show the highest 
degree of contingent variation with the biofeedback cue and, by 
association, with the internal target state as well. As a result, the 
subject will eventually become sensitive to and learn to group 
together those (internal and external) state cues whose com­
bined presence is indicative of the change in the internal target 
state and so will become able to detect and attribute the pres­
ence of the internal state to himself. 
Similarly, we hypothesize that the developmental process 
leading to sensitization to and categorization of emotion state 
cues in the self as a function of parental affect-mirroring is also 
mediated by the contingency-detection module. The onset of an 
emotion state in the baby will result in two types of automatic 
stimulus consequences: (a) It will induce a set of internal physi­
ological state changes, (b) It will trigger the expressive behavioral 
display of the emotion category. The activation of the emotion-
expressive display behaviors will produce a further set of inter­
nal (proprioceptive) stimuli that show contingent variation with 
the internal target state. 
Some of these stimulus cues, when considered in isolation, 
will have a relatively low degree of predictive validity in relation 
to the target state as they may be evoked by the presence of 
other internal states as well. However, there is evidence (Ekman 
1992b; Ekman et al. 1983; Izard and Malatesta 1987) indicating 
that there is a set of basic-emotion states that induce the activa­
tion of distinctive patterns of internal-state cues as well as a 
distinctive configuration of expressive behavioral cues. There­
fore, the predictive validity of these cues when combined as a 
group is highly indicative of the presence of the underlying 
emotion state. However, as we hypothesized earlier, infants are 
initially unaware of the categorical sets of internal-state cues in 
question. Therefore, to achieve the capacity to detect and at­

become sensitive to and categorize together the relevant group of 
internal-state cues that covary with the internal dispositional 
state. It is this learning process that, according to the present 
hypothesis, is made possible by the parent's intuitive provision 
of a state-contingent external biofeedback cue in the form of the 
empathic reflection of the infant's state-expressive emotion dis­
plays. 
In this view, the parent who—unlike the infant—is able to 
read and interpret the baby's affect-expressive facial, vocal, or 
postural emotion displays will produce affect-modulating inter­
active behaviors that will include the repeated production of an 
external reflection of the affect-expressive displays of the baby. 
This interactive process can be conceived of as a case of intuitive 
instructed learning in which the "teacher" role is played by the 
repeated presentation of the parent's affect-reflective emotion 
expression that is contingent on the presence of the dispositional 
emotion state in the infant.5 
Thus, we assume that perceiving the parent's affect-mirroring 
emotion expression, the baby will start to apply the contingency-
detection algorithm backward in time (the necessity index) to 
identify which of his internal and behavioral responses preceded 
the onset of the parent's affect-mirroring display. The infant will

brain injury in the occipital cortex, blindsight patients fWeiskrantz 1986) lose 
conscious awareness of part of their visual field, but they can nevertheless 
report about the presence and certain features of visual stimuli in their scotoma 
above chance level when asked to guess. However, they-can make use of the 
nonconscious visual information in this way only when prompted when to 
guess. Dennett's suggestion is to try to train blindsight patients to "guess when 
to guess" by providing them with an external biofeedback cue that indicates to 
them when they are in an (unconscious) informational state that allows for 
successful guessing. Dennett wonders (1991, p. 332) whether by initially relying 
on such a "biofeedback crutch," blindsight patients may eventually come to 
learn to guess when to guess successfully. Were this the case, he speculates, 
then such patients may also develop a sense of being conscious about being 
informed. As he puts it: the patient "doesn't just come to be informed about the 
motion of the light; he realizes he's come to be informed; ... he has a second-
order thought to the effect that he's just had a first-order thought" (pp. 332-

index) to identify the degree of predictive power they have over 
the parental target behavior. Following a strategy of contingency 
maximizing (Watson 1979), the baby's learning mechanism will 
compare the registered degree of contingent control experienced 
when testing forward versus backward in time and will then 
expand or reduce the set of cues considered to contribute to the 
contingent control over the external parental feedback, as a 
function of the direction of inequality between the necessity 
versus the sufficiency indices. This process will zero in on the set 
of internal and behavioral cues whose combined predictive valid­
ity shows the highest degree of contingent control over the 
parent's affect-mirroring display. Furthermore, since the latter 
covaries with the infant's internal dispositional emotion state as 
attributed by the parent, the set of internal and behavioral cues 
categorized together in the process of the contingency analysis 
will also be indicative of the emotion state of the infant. 
PARENTAL AFFECT-MIRRORING 
AND THE ON-LINE REGULATION OF EMOTION STATES 
The standard view concerning the function of parental affect-
mirroring behaviors is that they are involved in the on-line state 
regulation of the infant achieved by parental ministrations. This 
statement may sound uncontroversial—nevertheless, it may be 
worthwhile to consider a few observations that could induce 
doubt in its validity. One may argue, for example, that just 
because empathic emotion-mirroring behaviors occur during af­
fect-modulating interactions, one cannot be certain that they 
play an actual causal role in bringing about the desired state 
change in the infant. After all, affect-mirroring is embedded in a 
set of other parental behaviors (such as physical contact, tender 
holding, vocal stimulation, reorienting from obnoxious stimuli), 
which seem to be clearly instrumental in bringing about the 
modification of the infant's state. Furthermore, it may also seem 
paradoxical to some that the parental display of a negative affect, 
even though it reflects the to-be-regulated emotion display of the

become sensitive to and categorize together the relevant group of 
internal-state cues that covary with the internal dispositional 
state. It is this learning process that, according to the present 
hypothesis, is made possible by the parent's intuitive provision 
of a state-contingent external biofeedback cue in the form of the 
empathic reflection of the infant's state-expressive emotion dis­
plays. 
In this view, the parent who—unlike the infant—is able to 
read and interpret the baby's affect-expressive facial, vocal, or 
postural emotion displays will produce affect-modulating inter­
active behaviors that will include the repeated production of an 
external reflection of the affect-expressive displays of the baby. 
This interactive process can be conceived of as a case of intuitive 
instructed learning in which the "teacher" role is played by the 
repeated presentation of the parent's affect-reflective emotion 
expression that is contingent on the presence of the dispositional 
emotion state in the infant.5 
Thus, we assume that perceiving the parent's affect-mirroring 
emotion expression, the baby will start to apply the contingency-
detection algorithm backward in time (the necessity index) to 
identify which of his internal and behavioral responses preceded 
the onset of the parent's affect-mirroring display. The infant will 
also examine the contingent consequences of the sampled group

infant, would, in fact, lead to a decrease—rather than an escala­
tion—in the negative emotion state of the baby. On the basis of 
such arguments one could in fact reasonably claim that the 
parent's affect-mirroring displays may play no direct causal role 
in the affect regulation of the infant. Instead, they could be 
viewed simply as by-products of the parent's emotional recogni­
tion of and empathic identification with the baby's affective 
state, which would, in turn, lead to the actually effective affect-
regulative activities such as holding. 
Nevertheless, in our view the parent's affect-mirroring display 
behaviors during state-regulative interactions do, indeed, play a 
significant role in bringing about the modification of the infant's 
emotion state. We shall argue that there are several ways in 
which the contingency-detection and maximizing process in­
volved in interpreting the emotion-reflective displays of parents 
contributes to the affect-regulative influence of parental interac­
tions with the infant. 
First, observations of soothing interactions indicate that 
parental affect-mirroring does not accompany the infant's ongo­
ing negative emotion displays in a continuous manner. Rather, 
the parent is more likely to "join in" for brief periods with short 
bouts of empathic emotion-reflective displays and then to take 
"time-outs" or breaks before returning again to mirroring. (Dur­
ing the time-outs the caregiver may, of course, continue to 
engage in other, nonreflective soothing activities, such as hold­
ing, caressing, and talking to the baby.) This cyclic character of 
the distribution of mirroring acts over time may be a natural 
consequence of the nature of empathic identification with 
another person's emotion state: empathic emotion expressions 
tend to be brief communicative acts or gestures rather than 
more continuous state-expressions. However, the ensuing on-
and-off temporal structure of mirroring interactions has inter­
esting consequences when we consider it from the point of view 
of contingency analysis. 
Let us assume that the infant's contingency-detection system 
is testing backward in time (the necessity index) for the condi­
tional probability of the baby's emotional state cues preceding 
the appearance of the parent's mirroring display. Clearly, this 
will provide a very high contingency value on the necessity Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 173 
index, as the attuned parent will tend to produce empathic 
mirroring displays only when the baby is actively expressing the 
negative emotion in question. However, when the baby is testing 
forward in,.time (the sufficiency index) to see with what probabil­
ity his emotion responses result in the onset of the parent's 
mirroring display, he will register only a moderate degree of 
contingent control in the sufficiency index, as during "time-outs" 
his emotional displays are not going to be followed by empathic 
affect reflections on the part of the parent. Overall, therefore, 
assuming an attuned and empathic parent, the sufficiency index 
will show a lower degree of contingent control than will the 
necessity index due to the cyclic distribution of empathic emo­
tion-mirroring displays over time. 
According to the contingency-maximizing hypothesis (Watson 
1979), finding that the necessity index is higher than the suffi­
ciency index will induce the infant to reduce the response class 
to see whether he can bring the two indices closer to matching 
and thereby to discover the true degree of contingent control he 
has over the parental mirroring display. As a result, the infant 
will decrease the set of and/or the frequency and intensity of 
emotion responses he is producing. The net effect, therefore, of 
the infant's attempt at identifying the maximal degree of contin­
gent control he has over the mirroring display is the reduction in 
the frequency and intensity of negative emotion expression, which 
thus leads to the regulation (diminishing) of the negative affect 
state. 
A further source of affect regulation that results from the 
infant's contingency analysis is the resulting experience of caus­
al efficacy in controlling and bringing about the parental affect-
mirroring display. As we have seen, there is evidence (Watson 
1972, 1994) indicating that the detection of a high level of 
contingent control is positively arousing for infants—resulting in 
positive social responses such as smiling—and that they are 
motivated to modify their behavior in order to discover the actual 
degree of their contingent control (Watson 1979). Therefore, the 
detection of contingent control over the parent's affect-mirroring 
display will induce positive affect in the infant, which, through 
reciprocal inhibition, can be expected to decrease his negative 
affect state further.

An interesting additional feature of the complex contingency-
detection and -maximizing process described above is that the 
infant will experience the ensuing emotional state regulation as 
an active causal agent Apart from experiencing causal efficacy 
in bringing about an externalized version of his internal affective 
state in the form of the adult's emotion-reflective displays, the 
infant will simultaneously register the ensuing positive modifica­
tion of his negative affect state as well. Therefore, it can be 
hypothesized that successful emotion-regulative interactions in­
volving parental affect-mirroring may provide experiential basis 
for the establishment of a sense of self as self-regulating agent6 
In other words, it is suggested that affect-regulative mirroring 
interactions may provide the original proto-situation in which 
infants can learn that by externalizing their internal emotion 
states they can achieve successful regulation of their affective 
impulses. While at this stage the parent is vitally instrumental in 
this process as the medium of externalization, later in pretend 
play the child will already be able to produce an externalized 
version of his internal states without parental mediation. (This 
point is further elaborated in the description of the case of "Mat" 
in chapter 7.) 
6From this point of view, it may be worthwhile to contrast emotion-regulative 
interactions involving parental affect-mirroring with other, often equally effec­
tive, parental styles of emotion-regulation, such as, for example, the practice 
that can be called "disruption-soothing." This type of affect-regulation involves 
the abrupt induction of some intensive alternative emotion in the infant that is 
incompatible with the to-be-regulated negative affect—for example, by throwing 
the baby up in the air or by tickling him. Since in such emotion-regulative events 
the infant has no contingent control over the state transformation he is going 
through, it is likely that his experience will be a passive one of externally 
induced affect-modulation. A further interesting difference between disruption-
soothing versus soothing-by-mirroring has to do with the perceived locus of 
causal control over the state transformation that the infant is experiencing. In 
soothing-by-mirroring the infant perceives internal causal control as he experi­
ences active causal efficacy and agency in having contingent control over the 
ensuing state regulation. In contrast, in disruption-soothing the infant will 
locate the locus of causal control over his state transformation in an external 
agent or event. One may speculate that being systematically exposed to one 
versus the other type of parental soothing styles in infancy may contribute to the 
establishment of the individual differences in cognitive causal attribution styles 
(internal vs. external control) documented in the locus-of-control literature

THE REPRESENTATIONAL CONSEQUENCES 
OP PARENTAL AFFECT-MIRRORING: 
THE "MARKEDNESS" HYPOTHESIS 
Let us turn now to a somewhat different question concerning the 
nature of parental affect-mirroring interactions. As we have said, 
one of the most intriguing and apparently paradoxical aspects of 
parental affect-mirroring during state-regulative interactions is 
the fact that when the baby is in a negative state, the parent 
presents a reflection of a negative emotion display while success­
fully soothing the infant. How does the baby interpret the nega­
tive affect-expression of the parent, and how is it possible that 
the presentation of a negative emotion display is instrumental in 
modulating the infant's emotion state in a positive direction? 
Previously, we have argued that the infant first learns about 
the dispositional content of emotion expressive displays by ob­
serving the behavioral consequences of affect expressions in 
others. Assuming that the infant has in this way already come to 
represent the dispositional content of a given affect expression, 
the presentation of a corresponding emotion-reflective display by 
the parent during affect-regulative interactions may pose a po­
tential danger of misattribution. Clearly, the parent's affect-
reflecting display expresses an emotion state whose category is 
recognizable to the infant, but how does the baby know that this 
expression refers to his own state and not to that of the parent? 
Misattributing the expressed emotion to the parent would be 
especially problematic in the case of affect-regulative interac­
tions in which the parent's affect-reflective display expresses the 
infant's negative emotion state—say, his fear or anger. Were the 
infant to misattribute the expressed negative affect to the par­
ent, his own negative emotion state would, instead of becoming 
regulated, be likely to escalate, as the sight of a fearful or angry 
parent is clearly cause for alarm (and, if occurring systemati­
cally, of possible trauma—see Main and Hesse 1990, and also 
the case vignette in chapter 7). 
Thus, the question arises: How does the baby come to know 
that the dispositional state expressed by the external emotion 
display he seems to be controlling belongs to himself rather than 
to the parent, who is, after all, expressing it? In other words,

that the dispositional state expressed by the external emotion 
display he seems to be controlling belongs to himself rather than 
to the parent, who is, after all, expressing it? In other words, 

176 / Developmental Perspectives 
how does the baby come to understand that the parent's affect-
mirroring display is characterized by a special kind of referential 
property insofar as it is a reflection of the infant's state rather 
than that of the parent? We argue that this attribution problem 
is solved by a specific perceptual feature of the parent's affect-
expressive displays, which we refer to as their "markedness." 
In his seminal paper on the mother's mirroring function, 
Winnicott suggests that infants, when looking at their mother 
who is looking at them, see themselves in her face. This is so, 
says Winnicott, because when "the mother is looking at the 
baby . . . what she looks like is related to what she sees there" 
(1967, p. 131, emphasis in original). Winnicott's insight, how­
ever, leaves implicit the complex structural nature of the way the 
mother's face is related to that of the baby. In what follows we 
take a closer look at the structure of affect-regulative mirroring 
interactions in an attempt to specify those aspects of the mirror­
ing stimuli that allow the infant to interpret the mirroring face as 
a reflection of his own state. 
First of all, we should recognize that looking at the mirroring 
expression of the parent's face is qualitatively different from 
looking at one's reflection in a mirror. Recognizing himself in the 
mirror is no easy task for the baby; in fact, that cognitive feat is 
not achieved before the end of the second year of life (Gallup and 
Suarez 1986; Gergely 1994, 2001a; Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 
1979). Note, furthermore, that, unlike the parent's affect-reflect­
ing emotion displays, the mirror image is perfectly contingent 
both with the infant's visual features and with his behavior. 
Therefore, it can be argued that the processes that enable the 
infant to interpret the parental affect- mirroring displays as refer­
ring to the self are different from those involved in the under­
standing of the reflective properties of mirrors. 
In fact, when we look at the structural relation between the 
stimulus features of the parent's mirroring expression and those 
of the infant's state-expressive behavior, it becomes clear that 
the term "mirroring" is a seriously misleading one. First of all, let 
us note that no matter how well attuned the parent is to the 
baby's state, her mirroring facial andvocal behavior will never 
perfectly match the temporal, spatial, and sensory intensity 
parameters of the infant's behavioral expressions. This is a 
a Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 177 
crucial difference, as there is evidence to suggest that the infant 
is extremely sensitive to the distinction between perfect and high 
but imperfect degrees of response-stimulus contingencies, and 
he uses this information very early in life to categorize stimuli as 
belonging to the self or to a social object, respectively (Bahrick 
and Watson 1985; Watson 1979, 1994). This is important be­
cause it makes it clear that the simple recognition of the high— 
but necessarily imperfect—degree of correspondence between 
the infant's own state-expressive behaviors and the adult's af­
fect-mirroring displays will not be sufficient for the baby to 
interpret the parent's expressive display as referring to himself. 
Second, we should also realize that if the mother, in her 
attempt to mirror the baby's affect display as authentically as 
she can, were to produce her normal, realistic expression of the 
corresponding emotion, the chances of misattribution would 
dramatically increase, as the infant would identify the mother's 
affect expression as a realistic emotion display and would at­
tribute the corresponding dispositional emotion state to her. 
Therefore, to avoid the misattribution of the reflected emotion 
to the parent, it is proposed (see Gergely 1995a, 1995b, 2000) 
that mothers are instinctually driven to saliently mark their 
affect-mirroring displays to make them perceptually differenti-
able from their realistic emotion expressions. Marking is 
typically achieved by producing an exaggerated version of the 
parent's realistic emotion expression,7 similarly to the marked 
7 Of course, the idea of a separate register or marked communicative code for 
expressions directed to young children is not new. It has been described in the 
realm of verbal communication as "infant-directed speech" or "motherese" 
(Ferguson 1964; Femald 1991, 1992; Snow 1972). and it is characterized by 
phonological and syntactic modifications and prosodic cues such as elevated 
pitch and exaggerated pitch modulation. While several aspects of the distinctive 
prosodic patterns of child-directed speech have been suggested to facilitate early 
linguistic development (e.g., by highlighting word boundaries), researchers have 
also identified a number of primary, prelinguistic functions associated with 
infant-directed speech such as directing the infant's attention, modulating 
arousal and affect, or communicating emotions and intentions {Fernald 1991, 
1992; Stem. Spieker, Barnett, and Mackaln 1983). In fact, there is evidence 
(Femald 1991) for the cross-cultural universality of exaggerated intonation 
contour in infant-directed speech as well as for an innate preference for exagger­
ated prosody (Cooper and Aslin 1990). Femald (1992) argues that the exagger­
ated prosody of infant-directed speech is an evolutionary adaptation to the

how does the baby come to understand that the parent's affect-
mirroring display is characterized by a special kind of referential 
property insofar as it is a reflection of the infant's state rather 
than that of the parent? We argue that this attribution problem 
is solved by a specific perceptual feature of the parent's affect-
expressive displays, which we refer to as their "markedness." 
In his seminal paper on the mother's mirroring function, 
Winnicott suggests that infants, when looking at their mother 
who is looking at them, see themselves in her face. This is so, 
says Winnicott, because when "the mother is looking at the 
baby . . . what she looks like is related to what she sees there" 
(1967, p. 131, emphasis in original). Winnicott's insight, how­
ever, leaves implicit the complex structural nature of the way the 
mother's face is related to that of the baby. In what follows we 
take a closer look at the structure of affect-regulative mirroring 
interactions in an attempt to specify those aspects of the mirror­
ing stimuli that allow the infant to interpret the mirroring face as 
a reflection of his own state. 
First of all, we should recognize that looking at the mirroring 
expression of the parent's face is qualitatively different from 
looking at one's reflection in a mirror. Recognizing himself in the 
mirror is no easy task for the baby; in fact, that cognitive feat is 
not achieved before the end of the second year of life (Gallup and 
Suarez 1986; Gergely 1994, 2001a; Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 
1979). Note, furthermore, that, unlike the parent's affect-reflect­
ing emotion displays, the mirror image is perfectly contingent 
both with the infant's visual features and with his behavior. 
Therefore, it can be argued that the processes that enable the 
infant to interpret the parental affect- mirroring displays as refer­
ring to the self are different from those involved in the under­
standing of the reflective properties of mirrors. 
In fact, when we look at the structural relation between the 
stimulus features of the parent's mirroring expression and those 
of the infant's state-expressive behavior, it becomes clear that 
the term "mirroring" is a seriously misleading one. First of all, let 
us note that no matter how well attuned the parent is to the 
baby's state, her mirroring facial andvocal behavior will never 
perfectly match the temporal, spatial, and sensory intensity 
parameters of the infant's behavioral expressions. This is a 
a Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 177 
crucial difference, as there is evidence to suggest that the infant 
is extremely sensitive to the distinction between perfect and high 
but imperfect degrees of response-stimulus contingencies, and 
he uses this information very early in life to categorize stimuli as 
belonging to the self or to a social object, respectively (Bahrick 
and Watson 1985; Watson 1979, 1994). This is important be­
cause it makes it clear that the simple recognition of the high— 
but necessarily imperfect—degree of correspondence between 
the infant's own state-expressive behaviors and the adult's af­
fect-mirroring displays will not be sufficient for the baby to 
interpret the parent's expressive display as referring to himself. 
Second, we should also realize that if the mother, in her 
attempt to mirror the baby's affect display as authentically as 
she can, were to produce her normal, realistic expression of the 
corresponding emotion, the chances of misattribution would 
dramatically increase, as the infant would identify the mother's 
affect expression as a realistic emotion display and would at­
tribute the corresponding dispositional emotion state to her. 
Therefore, to avoid the misattribution of the reflected emotion 
to the parent, it is proposed (see Gergely 1995a, 1995b, 2000) 
that mothers are instinctually driven to saliently mark their 
affect-mirroring displays to make them perceptually differenti-
able from their realistic emotion expressions. Marking is 
typically achieved by producing an exaggerated version of the 
parent's realistic emotion expression,7 similarly to the marked 
7 Of course, the idea of a separate register or marked communicative code for 
expressions directed to young children is not new. It has been described in the 
realm of verbal communication as "infant-directed speech" or "motherese" 
(Ferguson 1964; Femald 1991, 1992; Snow 1972). and it is characterized by 
phonological and syntactic modifications and prosodic cues such as elevated 
pitch and exaggerated pitch modulation. While several aspects of the distinctive 
prosodic patterns of child-directed speech have been suggested to facilitate early 
linguistic development (e.g., by highlighting word boundaries), researchers have 
also identified a number of primary, prelinguistic functions associated with 
infant-directed speech such as directing the infant's attention, modulating 
arousal and affect, or communicating emotions and intentions {Fernald 1991, 
1992; Stem. Spieker, Barnett, and Mackaln 1983). In fact, there is evidence 
(Femald 1991) for the cross-cultural universality of exaggerated intonation 
contour in infant-directed speech as well as for an innate preference for exagger­
ated prosody (Cooper and Aslin 1990). Femald (1992) argues that the exagger­

"as-if manner of emotion display that is characteristically pro­
duced in pretend play. The marked affect-display, remains, nev­
ertheless, sufficiently similar to the parent's normative emotion 
expression for the infant to recognize the dispositional content of 
the emotion. However, it is hypothesized that due to the marked-
ness of the display the attribution of the perceived emotion to the 
parent will be inhibited. We shall call this process referential 
decoupling,8 referring to the fact that in the interpretation of the 
marked affect-display the referential connection between the 
emotion expression and the corresponding dispositional state of 
the agent producing the display will be suspended: the perceived 
emotion display will be "decoupled" from its referent. 
However, while due to its markedness the parental emotion 
display may become "decoupled" from its referent, it still needs 
to be interpreted by the infant from a referential point of view as 
expressing someone's emotion. We suggest that this process of 
referential anchoring is determined by the high degree of contin­
gent relation between the parent's affect-reflecting display and 
the infant's emotion-expressive behavior. The infant's contin-
infant's perceptual and physiological system with signal-enhancing as well as 
direct state-modulating properties. 
The current proposal is that the universal tendency to use exaggerated 
expressive patterns in infant-directed interactions will be present in affect-
mirroring displays as well. We suggest that apart from exaggerating the in-
tonational vocal pattern of their affect-expressive displays, caretakers will also 
exaggerate the visual facial features of the emotion display. In fact, Fernald 
(1992) reports that mothers of deaf children intuitively exaggerate the visual 
features of their facial communicative expressions. As an automatic conse­
quence, emotion-mirroring facial and vocal parental expressions will be marked 
as perceptually different from the corresponding realistic affect expressions of 
parents. Therefore, the "markedness" of affect-mirroring expressions and its 
representational consequences (see below) can be conceived of as a further and 
separate evolutionary function of the universal parental inclination to address 
infants with exaggerated expressive patterns of communication. 
8 The terms "referential decoupling" and "referential anchoring" were first 
introduced by Alan Leslie (1987, 1994) to characterize the representational 
properties of communicative expressions produced in pretend play. The poten­
tial functional and representational relationship between the markedness of 
affect-mirroring expressions, on the one hand, and the markedness of expres­
sions in the "pretend" mode of communication, on the other, is illustrated by the 
case vignette of "Mat" in chapter 7. Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 179 
gency-detection system will register the temporal contingency 
and cross-modal similarity of pattern between the parent's ex­
pression and his own on-going affective behavior. The perception 
of this contingent relation will provide the basis for the referen­
tial interpretation and grounding of the decoupled emotion dis­
play. As a result, the infant will referentially anchor the marked 
mirroring stimulus as expressing his own self-state. 
In this view, then, over time infants are likely to experience 
emotion displays of others in two differentforms: in their realistic 
and in their marked versions. We'hypothesize that the baby will 
come to represent these two forms as qualitatively different 
versions of the emotion expression not only because of their 
marked differences in terms of perceptual features, but also 
because of two further distinguishing characteristics: 
1. The situational features and behavioral outcomes that will 
become associated with the realistic emotion expression—such 
as with the sight of an angry mother—will be qualitatively dif­
ferent from those that are characteristic of the corresponding 
marked display—that is, the sight of an anger-reflecting mother. 
In other words, the dispositional outcomes associated with the 
realistic emotion will not hold for the case of the marked expres­
sion: instead of the negative behavioral and emotional conse­
quences typically accompanying a realistic anger display, when 
faced with a marked anger-reflecting display the infant will be 
likely to experience positive outcomes in the form of successful 
affect regulation. 
2. The realistic and the marked emotion displays of others will 
also become differentiated in terms of their different contingency 
relation to the infant's ongoing activity. Realistic emotion expres­
sions are likely to be much less under the infant's contingent 
control than are the marked emotion-reflective displays. A realis­
tic expression of, say, fear on the mother's face is more likely to 
be contingent on some external event or to be induced by some 
intrapsychic stimulus in the mother than to be under the control 
of a particular behavior of the infant. The marked affect-reflective 
version of the emotion display is, however, under the contingent

180 / Developmental Perspectives 
behavioral control of the baby, as it is produced as a response to 
the infant's corresponding emotion expression during affect-
regulative mirroring interactions. 
We hypothesize that in normal development the behavioral trans­
formations distinguishing the marked displays from the realistic 
ones will become established as a generalized communicative 
code associated with (a) referential decoupling of the expressed 
content from the agent producing the display, (b) referentially 
anchoring the expressed content in an agent other than the one 
displaying the emotion,9 and (c) suspension of the dispositional 
consequences of the realistic version of the expressed content 
(Gergely 1995a, 1995b, 2000). These features will become the 
central characteristics of the "as-if' mode of communication as it 
first emerges in the ability to comprehend and produce pretend 
play during the second year of life (see Fonagy and Target 1996; 
Leslie 1987, 1994). 
The markedness of the affect-mirroring display is likely to 
have a further interesting effect as well. Since the mirroring 
display is differentiated from the corresponding realistic emotion 
expression by its perceptual markedness, its differential disposi­
tional consequences, and its high degree of contingency with the 
baby's affective behavior, we hypothesize that the infant will 
construct a separate representation for it. Due to its contingent 
association with the infant's automatic affective reactions regis­
tered during the affect-regulative interactions, this representa­
tion will retain its associative link to the baby's primary-level 
affective states. Therefore, the separately represented marked 
emotion display will come to function as a secondary representa­
tional structure, which will become activated through associative 
routes whenever the set of internal-state cues corresponding to

marked emotion is anchored in the infant as a result of the experience of 
contingent control; later, however—for example, in the use of the marked code in

imaginary—agent with whom the person producing the marked behavior identi­
fies (see Leslie 1987, 1994). Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 181 
the given dispositional emotion state are activated in the infant. 
Henceforth, the onset of an emotion state will result in the 
automatic activation of this "proto-symbolic" secondary emotion 
representation in the baby's awareness, allowing him to at­
tribute the dispositional emotion state to himself. 
In sum, it can be argued that the instinctive inclination of 
parents to expose their infants to marked affect-reflective be­
havioral displays during emotion-regulative interactions results 
in three significant developmental consequences: [a) The infant 
will come to detect and group together the sets of internal-state 
cues that are indicative of his categorically distinct dispositional 
emotion states, (b) He will establish secondary representations 
associated with his primary-level procedural affect states provid­
ing the cognitive means for accessing and attributing emotion 
states to the self, (c) He will acquire a generalized communicative 
code of "marked" expressions characterized by the represen­
tational functions of referential decoupling, anchoring, and sus­
pension of realistic consequences. 
'AFFECT ATTUNEMENT" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW 
OF THE SOCIAL BIOFEEDBACK THEORY 
Stern (1984, 1985; Stern, Hofer, Haft,.and Dore 1985) has also 
proposed a theory concerning the role of parental affect-reflective 
behaviors in early socio-emotional development. Similarly to 
our position, Stern believes that interactions involving emotion-
reflective parental displays have a significant influence on 
self-development and affective self-regulation. His views on the 
developmental functions and mediating mechanisms involved in 
affect-reflective parental interactions, however, differ from ours 
in several important respects. 
Stern's theory focuses on a specific type of affect-reflective 
interaction that he calls "affect attunements," which he demon­
strated to occur regularly in normal mother-infant interactions 
between the ages of 9 and 12 months (Stern et al. 1985). He 
noted that during free play mothers periodically reflect some

behavioral control of the baby, as it is produced as a response to 
the infant's corresponding emotion expression during affect-
regulative mirroring interactions. 
We hypothesize that in normal development the behavioral trans­
formations distinguishing the marked displays from the realistic 
ones will become established as a generalized communicative 
code associated with (a) referential decoupling of the expressed 
content from the agent producing the display, (b) referentially 
anchoring the expressed content in an agent other than the one 
displaying the emotion,9 and (c) suspension of the dispositional 
consequences of the realistic version of the expressed content 
(Gergely 1995a, 1995b, 2000). These features will become the 
central characteristics of the "as-if' mode of communication as it 
first emerges in the ability to comprehend and produce pretend

have a further interesting effect as well. Since the mirroring 
display is differentiated from the corresponding realistic emotion 
expression by its perceptual markedness, its differential disposi­

construct a separate representation for it. Due to its contingent

'AFFECT ATTUNEMENT" FROM THE POINT OF VIEW 
OF THE SOCIAL BIOFEEDBACK THEORY 
Stern (1984, 1985; Stern, Hofer, Haft,.and Dore 1985) has also 
proposed a theory concerning the role of parental affect-reflective 
behaviors in early socio-emotional development. Similarly to 
our position, Stern believes that interactions involving emotion-
reflective parental displays have a significant influence on 
self-development and affective self-regulation. His views on the 
developmental functions and mediating mechanisms involved in 
affect-reflective parental interactions, however, differ from ours 
in several important respects. 
Stern's theory focuses on a specific type of affect-reflective 
interaction that he calls "affect attunements," which he demon­
strated to occur regularly in normal mother-infant interactions 
between the ages of 9 and 12 months (Stern et al. 1985). He 
noted that during free play mothers periodically reflect some 

182 / Developmental Perspectives 
aspect of their infant's actions by providing a partial match of 
the baby's behavior in another modality. For example, he de­
scribes an 8^-month-old boy who is reaching for a toy just 
beyond reach. As he is stretching his body in an obvious volun­
tary effort to achieve his goal, "his mother says 'uuuuuh . . . 
uuuuuh!' with a crescendo of vocal effort. The mother's acceler­
ating vocal-respiratory effort matched the infant's accelerating 
physical effort" (Stern et al. 1985, p. 250). 
Stern makes several interesting points concerning the nature 
of such acts of behavioral attunement. Among other things, he 
emphasizes the fact that they are not simple acts of imitation, as 
they involve only a partial match of the amodal (temporal, inten­
sity, and shape) characteristics of the infant's target act ren­
dered in a different modality. He also points out that "during the 
first half year of life it is our impression—as yet untested—that 
imitations predominate over attunements. The reverse is true 
after nine months" (Stern 1984, p. 11). 
Stern proposes that the reason why at around 9 months the 
mother—nonconsciously—chooses to "attune" to, rather than 
simply provide an imitative replica of, the infant's behavior is 
that she intends to refer to the internal affect state of the infant 
rather than to his surface behavior. In Stern's view, the matched 
amodal characteristics correspond to the abstract representa­
tional forms of affects that accompany the external behavioral 
act. Thus, the suggested function of such affect attunements is 
that of "interpersonal communion": "to share" or "to participate 
in" the internal affective experience of the infant. Of course, for 
the infant to interpret affect attunements as indicating parental 
sharing of his internal mental state, he must be [a) aware of his 
affect state, and he (b) must understand that the parent also 
experiences internal mental states, which (c) can be either 
shared or different from the particular mental state of the infant. 
Stern argues for this view by pointing out a purported correla­
tion between the emerging dominance of parental attunements— 
over imitations^starting at 9 months on the one hand, and the 
emergence of the infant's "naive theory of interfaceable minds" 
(Bretherton and Bates 1979) during the same period on the 
other. Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 183 
Before contrasting Stern's ideas with ours, let us point out 
some aspects of his proposal that seem questionable to us. 
1. Central to Stern's argument is the contention that at around 
9 months there is a shift in the mother's reflective behaviors from 
intramodal faithful imitations to cross-modal attunements of 
amodal properties rendered in a different modality. However, it 
should be pointed out that in the technical sense, all imitative 
behaviors are—at least partially—cross-modal: if a tongue pro­
trusion is faithfully imitated with a tongue protrusion, the infant 
experiences an intermodal (motor-visual) correspondence be­
tween his own behavior and the imitative act of the parent. It is 
also well known that even newborn infants are able to appreciate 
cross-modal correspondence, as shown by phenomena such as 
neonatal imitation (Kaye and Bower 1994, 1979; Meltzoff and 
Moore 1977, 1989; Stem 1985). Obviously, then, what Stern has 
in mind is not so much the question of intra- vs. intersensory 
modality but, rather, the fact that the attunement behavior, 
while showing a partial match in terms of amodal properties, is 
an act that is different from the target behavior of the infant. 
2. Whether Stern's impression about a qualitative shift at 
around 9 months from imitations to attunements can be empiri­
cally substantiated remains to be seen. Certainly, mothers do 
engage in attunement behaviors even much earlier (as in the 
prototypical theme-variation games described by Watson 1972). 
However, even if we assume with Stern that there is a statistical 
tendency to engage, in more attunements than imitations after 9 
months, there seems to be a more mundane reason for this than 
Stern's account in terms of the emerging mentalism of the infant. 
At the end of the first year, infants become more mobile, and the 
previously dominant face-to-face interactions are superseded 
by object-oriented joint activities (Stern 1985; Trevarthen and 
Hubley 1978). This imposes a pragmatic constraint on the 
mother's choice of behavior when she intends to reflect the 
infant's target act in a way that is accessible to the infant; for 
example, if the baby is visually orienting toward a toy that he is 
reaching for rather than toward the parent, the mother may be 
forced to attune to the baby's motor effort vocally.

should be pointed out that in the technical sense, all imitative 
behaviors are—at least partially—cross-modal: if a tongue pro­
trusion is faithfully imitated with a tongue protrusion, the infant 
experiences an intermodal (motor-visual) correspondence be­
tween his own behavior and the imitative act of the parent. It is 
also well known that even newborn infants are able to appreciate 
cross-modal correspondence, as shown by phenomena such as 
neonatal imitation (Kaye and Bower 1994, 1979; Meltzoff and 
Moore 1977, 1989; Stem 1985). Obviously, then, what Stern has 
in mind is not so much the question of intra- vs. intersensory 
modality but, rather, the fact that the attunement behavior, 
while showing a partial match in terms of amodal properties, is 
an act that is different from the target behavior of the infant. 
2. Whether Stern's impression about a qualitative shift at 
around 9 months from imitations to attunements can be empiri­
cally substantiated remains to be seen. Certainly, mothers do 
engage in attunement behaviors even much earlier (as in the 
prototypical theme-variation games described by Watson 1972). 
However, even if we assume with Stern that there is a statistical 
tendency to engage, in more attunements than imitations after 9 
months, there seems to be a more mundane reason for this than 
Stern's account in terms of the emerging mentalism of the infant. 
At the end of the first year, infants become more mobile, and the 
previously dominant face-to-face interactions are superseded 
by object-oriented joint activities (Stern 1985; Trevarthen and 
Hubley 1978). This imposes a pragmatic constraint on the 
mother's choice of behavior when she intends to reflect the 
infant's target act in a way that is accessible to the infant; for 
example, if the baby is visually orienting toward a toy that he is 
reaching for rather than toward the parent, the mother may be 
forced to attune to the baby's motor effort vocally. 

184 / Developmental Perspectives 
3. While the momentous changes in the infant's competence 
after the age of 9 months—such as joint attention, pointing, 
gaze-following, or social referencing—have been interpreted by 
some researchers as indicating the emergence of understanding 
of intentional mind states (Bretherton 1991a; Bretherton and 
Bates 1979; Stern 1985), others have resisted this temptation 
and proposed nonmentalistic interpretations for the same phe­
nomena (Barresi and Moore 1996; Gergely et al. 1995; Gewirtz 
and Pelaez-Nogueras 1992; Moore and Corkum 1994). For exam­
ple, as one of us has argued in detail elsewhere (Csibra and 
Gergely 1998; Gergely and Csibra 1997), the emerging new 
competencies at the end of the first year can be understood in 
terms of a "naive theory of rational action," which is an as 
yet nonmentalistic teleological interpretational system. Further­
more, while the 9-month-old may not have an appreciation of 
mind states as yet, mothers certainly attribute intentionality and 
mentalizing to their infant even at a much earlier age (as shown 
by the work on cognitive scaffolding by Bruner, Stern, and 
others: see, e.g., Bruner 1983; Reznick 1999; Stern 1985; Wood, 
Bruner, and Ross 1976). In terms of Stern's hypothesis that the 
function of attunements is to signal the sharing of attributed 
internal affect states, this would predict that caregivers engage 
in affect attunements even before their infant is 9 months of age. 
In our minds, the above arguments raise enough doubts con­
cerning Stern's interpretation of the function and nature of 
affect attunements that it may be worthwhile to explore an 
alternative approach to this intriguing developmental phenom­
enon. Our contingency-based social biofeedback model of affect-
reflective parental behaviors provides such an alternative. 
Note first of all that the three amodal features—time, inten­
sity, and shape—identified by Stern as the abstract stimulus 
properties matched in affect attunements correspond to the 
three sources of contingency monitored by the contingency-
detection module (Gergely and Watson 1999). Therefore, even if 
an attunement behavior is presented only on a single occasion, 
the combined value of the three contingency parameters can be 
sufficient to indicate a highly-but- imperfectly contingent exter­
nal stimulus that is controlled by the infant's preceding 
H Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 185 
behavior. In other words, the contingency-detection device will 
categorize the parent's attunement behavior as a causal conse­
quence of the infant's on-going activity, resulting in a momen­
tary sense of causal efficacy and the concomitant induction of 
positive arousal. The ensuing fleeting sense of causal control and 
instrumentality will become associated with the particular act in 
which the infant is engaged while being attuned to. This leads to 
our first proposal concerning the developmental function of re­
flective attunements: by momentarily attuning to them, the par­
ent can selectively reinforce those affective, voluntary, or playful 
acts of the infant that she would like to see continued or re­
peated in the future. In other words, reflective attunements are 
an efficient tool of early nonverbal socialization whereby the 
parent can selectively reinforce and shape the infant's emerging 
voluntary, goal-oriented, or playful social activities. 
In a somewhat more speculative vein, we would also like to 
propose that selective attunements might serve an additional 
sensitizing and representation-building function as well. Recall 
that our model, unlike Stern's, assumes that infants initially 
lack awareness of their internal affective and proprioceptive 
states that accompany their behaviors. By providing a partial 
rendering of some of the amodal features of the target act in a 
different behavioral format, the attunement behavior presents 
the infant with a nonidentical but highly contingent externalized 
version of his procedural behavioral routine. As a result, the 
infant will form a representation of the reflected amodal fea­
tures that will become associated, due to their high degree of 
perceived contingency, with the nonconscious, primary, proce­
dural representation of his on-going activity. In this way, reflec­
tive attunements contribute to the establishment of secondary 
representations of primary procedural states, which will be more 
cognitively accessible and more subject to conscious awareness. 
This hypothesized secondary representation-building process 
can be conceived of as a special case of what Annette Karmiloff-
Smith (1992) has called "representational redescription." She 
has argued that the human mind has the capacity to access and 
re-represent in a more explicit and cognitively accessible form 
the implicitly represented structural information embedded in 
nonconscious, automatic procedural routines. While Karmiloff-

Smith's theory postulates an innate endogenous epistemic drive 
that carries out such a process of "self-discovery" of one's own 
mind, our social biofeedback model identifies the contingent 
reflective externalizations provided by social partners as the 
informational basis for re-representing the amodal internal 
structure of nonconscious primary representations. 
But do affect attunements serve the function of interpersonal 
communion or internal state sharing as well, as suggested by 
Stern? Our guess is that initially this may not yet be the case, 
especially insofar as the infant has not yet been sensitized to his 
internal categorical affect states as a result of the social biofeed­
back training provided by affect-reflective interactions. We do 
agree, however, that communicating the sharing of internal 
states may become a secondary function of attunement behav­
iors later in life. In verbal behavior, paraphrasing often serves 
the function of informing the other that the underlying meaning 
of his surface utterance has been correctly encoded. Nonverbal 
reflective attunements are also likely to come to serve a similar 
communicative function later in life. 
MELTZOFF AND GOPNIKS "LIKE ME" HYPOTHESIS 
Meltzoff and Gopnik (1993; Gopnik and Meltzoff 1997; Meltzoff 
1990) have proposed that imitative interactions between care­
givers and infants can provide a basis that could lead babies to 
pay special attention to fellow human beings. This arises in 
specific regard to the times that the caregivers imitate their 
infants as opposed to when the babies imitate the caregivers. 
Meltzoff and Gopnik propose that an infant may use his innate 
cross-modal capacity to map the caregiver's visual movements 
onto the proprioceptive feelings of his own movements, which 
the parent is imitating. The caregiver's movements become at­
tractive (attention capturing) because they are perceived (via the 
mapping) to be very much like the baby's own. For example, 
Meltzoff (1990) used a preferential interaction paradigm in which 
14-month-old infants were faced with two adult models, one of 
whom imitated the child's object-related behaviors as best as she 
& Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 187 
could, whereas the other always performed a temporally contin­
gent but dissimilar (spatially noncontingent) action. The infants 
looked and smiled more at the adult who mimicked them than at 
the one whose actions were only temporally contingent with 
theirs. Meltzoff and Gopnik hypothesize that it is the infants* 
"like me" experience that explains their preferential attention 
and smiling to the mimicking adult model over the only tempo­
rally contingent one. 
Since our contingency-based social biofeedback theory also 
generates specific predictions for the infant's attraction to paren­
tal "mirroring" acts, we would like to make explicit two important 
differences between our position and that of Meltzoff and Gopnik. 
First, Meltzoff and Gopnik (1993) assume that infants have 
direct introspective access to their internal "feeling states" from 
the beginning of life. In contrast, we are assuming that initially 
many of the infants' state transitions are outside their perceptual 
awareness. We assume this to be so both for the visceral and 
for the physiological state cues that accompany basic-emotion 
states and for many of the proprioceptive consequences of facial 
muscular movement. Indeed, a central aspect of our model is 
that these internal-state cues of the infant only become liminal 
after a period of biofeedback sensitization brought about as a 
result of parental mirroring interactions. This difference in as­
sumption about what is and what is not "felt" by the infant is not 
likely to be resolvable empirically, however. The reason for this 
pessimism is that we, and very probably Meltzoff and Gopnik as 
well, are using the term "felt" in the sense of a state of conscious 
awareness. For example, we do not contend that the infant has 
no functional use of proprioceptive feedback from facial muscle 
movement prior to social mirroring experiences. What we con­
tend is that while such feedback exists and is used in various 
motor control systems, it does not enter conscious awareness. 
For us as adults, many motor events—such as eye movement, 
head rotation, chest diaphragm expansion, and even limb mo­
tion—are subliminal until we attend to them. But it is not easy to 
think of how to measure such a distinction in relation to the 
subjective experience of an infant. 
The second point of difference between our model and Meltzoff 
and Gopnik's "like me" hypothesis about the attractiveness of

The second point of difference between our model and Meltzoff

188 / Developmental Perspectives 
social mirroring is far more assessable empirically. The "like me" 
hypothesis would seem to predict clearly that the more closely 
the mirroring act reproduces the infant's behavior, the more 
attractive it will be for the baby. In contrast, we assume (see 
Bahrick and Watson 1985; Watson 1994) that after the age of 
about 3 months, the target setting of the contingency-detection 
mechanism of the normal human infant is switched toward 
seeking out high but imperfect degrees of contingency. This 
predicts a preference for high but imperfectly contingent mirror­
ing displays over perfectly contingent ones, whereas the opposite 
prediction follows from the "like me" hypothesis. 
Our explanation for the looking pattern in Meltzoffs (1990) 
study is that the mimicking model provides a high but neverthe­
less only imperfectly contingent action that is preferred as such 
over the simply temporally contingent model, which produces a 
much lower degree of contingency. We agree with Meltzoff and 
Gopnik that the infants appear to use the spatial—or, in their 
words, structural—information in differentiating between the 
two models. Somewhat tautologically, however, we propose that 
the preference for the temporal plus spatial (the mimicking 
adult) over the merely temporal (the alternative model) contin­
gency simply indicates that the imitating model provided a con­
tingency magnitude that was closer to the target criterion of 
best—high-but-not-perfect—contingency of the contingency-de­
tection mechanism than was the alternative model. 
THE "NEARLY, BUT CLEARLY NOT, LIKE ME" 
HYPOTHESIS 
In contrast to Meltzoff and Gopnik's "like me" hypothesis, how­
ever, we predict that if given a choice between a perfectly contin­
gent and the highly but only imperfectly contingent imitative 
display used by Meltzoff, after the age. of 3 months the infant 
would preferentially attend to the latter. In other words, we 
predict that the infant would be attracted to the "nearly, but 
clearly not, like me" versus the "like me" display because, rather 
than preferentially orienting toward a self-like (perfect) contin-Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 189 
gency, he is committed to engaging contingencies that are spe^ 
cifically not self-based (i.e., not perfect). 
To test this hypothesis, one of us has carried out a study 
that has specifically contrasted the effect on young children's 
behavior of the availability of perfect as against imitative feed­
back of their manual activity (see Magyar and Gergely 1998). We 
tested 32 children between 18 and 36 months of age, who sat in 
front of two TV monitors each displaying the moving image of a 
schematic hand. The subjects moved a small metal bowl (with a 
computer mouse hidden inside) freely on the surface of the table 
in front of them. On one of the screens they saw the per­
fectly response-contingent movements of the schematic hand, 
generated by a computer program controlled by the subjects' 
manual manipulation of the bowl. The second screen displayed a 
highly but imperfectly response-contingent image of the sche­
matic hand, which was generated by the imitative efforts of a 
human experimenter. This person attempted to copy the sub­
ject's manual behavior faithfully by moving a mouse under the 
visual guidance of the subject-generated movements of the sche­
matic hand (the perfect feedback display) viewed on a separate 
monitor in another room. This procedure was used in an attempt 
to provide the normal lag and imperfection of a human act of 
direct imitation. We found that the children attended more to the 
imitation-based (highly but imperfectly) contingent image than 
to the perfectly contingent one (p < 0.04). This, then, provides 
support for our hypothesis that children are selectively attracted 
to response-contingent stimuli that are "nearly, but clearly not, 
like them" rather than being "just like them."

IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL 
PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND THERAPEUTIC 
INTERVENTIONS 
Having presented our social biofeedback model of affect-mirror­
ing within the framework of a theory of normal emotional devel­
opment, we shall discuss some clinical implications of our model 

190 / Developmental Perspectives 
with the aim of integrating it with current psychodynamic ap­
proaches to mirroring developed in object-relations theory and 
attachment theory. 
Our social biofeedback model of affect-mirroring postulates a 
complex biosocial system in which the infant is instinctually 
driven to express the dynamic changes in his internal affect 
states behaviorally, while the mother is instinctually driven to 
reflect the infant's state-expressive behaviors in a marked form. 
This system serves two major developmental functions: the mir­
roring environment (a) contributes to the on-line homeostatic 
regulation of the infant's dynamic affective state changes and (b) 
provides a kind of "teaching" or "scaffolding" environment that 
results in the internalization of the maternal affect-regulative 
function through the establishment of secondary representa­
tions of the infant's primary emotion states. In fact, it can be 
argued that this theory is close in spirit to certain psychody­
namic characterizations of the developmental functions of the 
infant's maternal environment as formulated in attachment 
theory (Bowlby 1969), object-relations theory (Bion 1962a; Win­
nicott 1965), self psychology (Kohut 1971, 1977), or analytically 
oriented developmental theory (Stern 1985). 
These diverse approaches share a strong emphasis on the 
vital causal role played in the infant's early psychic development 
by the mother's biologically determined ability and inclination to 
read, modulate, and reflect back the infant's state-expressive 
behaviors. These theories also agree that such maternal minis­
trations, apart from providing on-line need satisfaction and state 
regulation for the baby, also contribute significantly to psychic 
structure-building and to the emergence of emotional self-
awareness and control. In fact, a number of these theories have 
explicitly identified the mother's ability to adaptively "mirror," 
"echo," or "match" the infant's affective states as a significant 
and central mechanism underlying the early development of the 
self (Bion 1962a, 1962b; P. F. Kernberg 1984; Kohut 1971, 1977; 
Mahler and McDevitt 1982; Mahler et al. 1975; Stern 1985; 
Winnicott 1967). However, no specific models have been ad­
vanced to characterize the psychological processes through 
which affect-mirroring achieves the various developmental func-Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 191 
tions that have been attributed to it. Therefore, we wish to 
suggest that our social biofeedback model can be interpreted as 
specifying an underlying psychological mechanism that medi­
ates—at least some of—the developmental effects of the affect-
reflective maternal environment as discussed, for example, in 
Winnicott's model of the mother's holding function (Winnicott 
1965), Kohut's model of the maternal mirroring function (Kohut 
1971, 1977), or Bion's model of maternal containment (Bion 
1962a, 1962b). 
For example, both Winnicott and Kohut emphasize the impor­
tance of the infant's early experience of omnipotence for healthy 
self-development that is afforded by maternal attunement to and 
mirroring of the infant's need states. This clinical insight may be 
related to the workings of the contingency-detection mechanism 
proposed in our social biofeedback model. In this view, the sense 
of infantile omnipotence may be interpreted as corresponding to 
the sense of causal efficacy and control that is generated by the 
contingency-detection mechanism during adaptive mirroring in­
teractions. 
Another example is contained in certain features of Bion's 
influential notion of the maternal "container" function (Bion 
1962a, 1962b). According to Bion, the mother "contains" and re­
presents in a modified form the negative contents that the infant 
projects into her. He suggests that "the mother, with her capacity 
for reverie, transforms the unpleasant sensations . . . and pro­
vides relief for the infant who then reintrojects the mitigated and 
modified emotional experience" (Grinberg, Sor, and De Bianchedi 
1977, p. 57). Bion (1962a) also emphasizes that maternal con­
tainment, transformation, and re-presentation of the baby's neg­
ative internal states is a necessary prerequisite for the infant to 
become able to reflect upon and process his experience, or in 
Bion's words, to think his own thoughts and feel his own feel­
ings. In terms of our social biofeedback model, these ideas can 
be interpreted as referring to the mother's ability to modulate 
the infant's negative affect by producing contingent and 
marked emotion-reflective displays on the one hand, and to the 
ensuing establishment of the secondary representations of 
the infant's primary emotion states through the introjection

with the aim of integrating it with current psychodynamic ap­
proaches to mirroring developed in object-relations theory and 
attachment theory. 
Our social biofeedback model of affect-mirroring postulates a 
complex biosocial system in which the infant is instinctually 
driven to express the dynamic changes in his internal affect 
states behaviorally, while the mother is instinctually driven to 
reflect the infant's state-expressive behaviors in a marked form. 
This system serves two major developmental functions: the mir­
roring environment (a) contributes to the on-line homeostatic 
regulation of the infant's dynamic affective state changes and (b) 
provides a kind of "teaching" or "scaffolding" environment that 
results in the internalization of the maternal affect-regulative 
function through the establishment of secondary representa­
tions of the infant's primary emotion states. In fact, it can be 
argued that this theory is close in spirit to certain psychody­
namic characterizations of the developmental functions of the 
infant's maternal environment as formulated in attachment 
theory (Bowlby 1969), object-relations theory (Bion 1962a; Win­
nicott 1965), self psychology (Kohut 1971, 1977), or analytically 
oriented developmental theory (Stern 1985). 
These diverse approaches share a strong emphasis on the 
vital causal role played in the infant's early psychic development 
by the mother's biologically determined ability and inclination to 
read, modulate, and reflect back the infant's state-expressive 
behaviors. These theories also agree that such maternal minis­
trations, apart from providing on-line need satisfaction and state 
regulation for the baby, also contribute significantly to psychic 
structure-building and to the emergence of emotional self-
awareness and control. In fact, a number of these theories have 
explicitly identified the mother's ability to adaptively "mirror," 
"echo," or "match" the infant's affective states as a significant 
and central mechanism underlying the early development of the 
self (Bion 1962a, 1962b; P. F. Kernberg 1984; Kohut 1971, 1977; 
Mahler and McDevitt 1982; Mahler et al. 1975; Stern 1985; 
Winnicott 1967). However, no specific models have been ad­

of the marked and decoupled affect-reflective maternal expres­
sions on the other. 
Until now our discussion of the nature of parental affect-
mirroring has concentrated on the case of adaptive and success­
ful emotion-regulative interactions and their consequences for 
normal development. However, based on our model, we can also 
specify some of the processes that may result in pathological 
development of emotions in deviant parental mirroring environ­
ments. 
NORMAL VERSUS PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES 
OF AFFECT-MIRRORING 
According to our model, adaptive affect-reflective interactions 
result in the following consequences in normal development: 
(a) Due to the markedness of the mirroring display, the ex­
pressed affect will be decoupled from the parent, (b) As a result 
of the high degree of contingency between the infant's emotion 
state and the marked affect-mirroring display, the expressed 
emotion will be referentially anchored as belonging to the baby, 
(c) The infant will establish a separate representation for the 
marked emotion-expression of the parent that will be associa-
tively linked to his implicit procedural primary emotion state, (d) 
Due to its similarity to—and categorical identity with—the par­
ent's corresponding realistic emotion display, the internalized 
marked emotion representation will "inherit" the dispositional 
information already associated with the parent's realistic emo­
tion expression. In this way, the infant will not only acquire a 
secondary, cognitively accessible representation of his primary 
emotion state, but will also become able to attribute to himself 
the dispositional information associated with that emotion, re­
sulting in an ability to represent and predict his likely behavior 
when being in that state. 
Given these consequences for normal development, our social 
biofeedback model of affect-mirroring can also identify certain 
structural types of deviant mirroring styles that may result in 
pathological outcomes. In particular, the selective lack of either Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 193 
markedness or category congruence may produce deviant mirror­
ing styles that, if they become dominant in the infant's experi­
ence, may to lead to characteristic pathological consequences. 
Deviant Affect-Mirroring Styles 
1. Lack of markedness. Let us first take the case of affect-
mirroring that is categorically congruent but lacks perceptual 
marking. (A case illustration of this kind of deviant affect-mirror­
ing is provided in chapter 7.) Mothers who, due to their own 
unresolved intrapsychic conflicts, are unable to contain and 
become overwhelmed by their infant's negative affect-expres­
sions can be expected to show this structural pattern of mirror­
ing. Borderline patients or parents showing the "preoccupied" (E) 
profile in Mary Main's Adult Attachment Interview10 (George et 
al. 1985; Main and Goldwyn 1991) are likely candidates for 
exhibiting unmarked affective responses of this kind. (See also 
Fonagy, Steele, et al. 1995.) 
Such parents react to their infant's negative affect-expression 
by producing the same—categorically congruent—emotion-ex­
pression, but in an unmarked, realistic manner. According to our 
hypothesis, the dominance of this kind of deviant mirroring style 
is likely to lead to the following consequences: (a) Since the 
mirroring affect-display is not marked, it is not going to be 
decoupled from the caregiver and will be attributed to the parent 
as her real emotion, (b) As the unmarked emotion display is not 
decoupled, it will also not become anchored to the infant. Conse­
quently, the secondary representation of the baby's primary 
emotion state will not be established, leading to a corresponding 
deficiency in self-perception and self-control of affect, (c) Since 
the infant will attribute the mirrored affect to the parent, he will 
experience his own negative affect "out there" as belonging to the 
other, rather than to himself, (d) Instead of regulating the in-
10 Patrick, Hobson, Castle, Howard, and Maughan (1994) provided evidence 
indicating a strong correlation between borderline pathology and "E" classifica­
tion on the AA1, and this was confirmed in a larger study with personality-
disordered controls (Fonagy, Leigh, et al. 1996).

fant's.negative affect, the perception of a corresponding realistic 
negative emotion in the parent will escalate the baby's negative 
state, leading to traumatization rather than containment (Main 
and Hesse 1990). 
This constellation corresponds to the clinical characterization 
of projective identification as a pathological defensive mechanism 
characteristic of borderline personality disorder (Kernberg 1976; 
Klein 1946; Sandler 1987; H. Segal 1964). Therefore, it can be 
hypothesized that sustained experience with categorically con­
gruent but unmarked affect-mirroring in infancy might play an 
important causal role in the establishment of projective identifi­
cation as the dominant form of emotional experience in border­
line personality development. 
2. Lack of category congruence. A second type of deviant mir­
roring structure might be produced by the dominance of marked, 
but incongruent, categorically distorted parental mirroring. Over-
controlling parental attitude and/or defensively distorted paren­
tal perception of the infant's affect may produce a mirroring style 
of this sort. Think of an infant whose erotically colored excite­
ment about physical contact induces anxiety and defensive an­
ger in the mother due to her intrapsychic conflicts in relation to 
bodily tenderness. The mother might project her defensive emo­
tional reaction onto the infant, as a result of which she will 
distortedly perceive the baby's libidinal excitement as aggres­
sion. She may then proceed to modulate this thus (mis) perceived 
affect in her baby by properly marked mirroring of an aggressive 
display. 
According to the present hypothesis, marked but categorically 
distorted affect-mirroring of this kind, when dominant in the 
infant's experience, may lead to the following consequences: 
[a) Due to the markedness of the mirrored affect, it will be 
decoupled from the parent, (b) As the mirroring display shows a 
sufficiently high degree of contingency with the infant's—mis-
categorized—affect state, he will referentially anchor the mir­
rored affect-display to his primary emotion state, (c) However, 
since the category of the mirrored affect is incongruent with the 
actual affect state of the infant, he will establish a distorted 
secondary representation of his primary emotion state. As a Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 195 
result, the infant will attribute dispositional information to him­
self that is incongruent with his actual (primary) emotion state, 
leading to a distorted perception of his self-state. 
Thus, one may speculate that marked, but categorically dis­
torted, incongruent mirroring of affects might be causally related 
to pathologically distorted self-representations, which may, for 
example, underlie sexual pathologies in which libidinal excite­
ment is perceived as aggression. 
This type of deviant mirroring provides a link between our 
model and Winnicott's concept of the false self. According to 
Winnicott (1960a), impingements from the environment may 
arise out of the caregiver's difficulty in understanding the in­
fant's thoughts or feelings, substituting her gestures instead of 
representing his own intentional state to the baby, invalidating 
the gestures, and obstructing his illusion of omnipotence. When 
this continues despite persistence by the infant, Winnicott sug­
gests that a number of reactions can arise: the self may be 
overwhelmed, it may become anxious anticipating further im­
pingement, it may come to experience itself only when it acts in 
opposition to impingements, and, finally, it can acquiesce and 
hide its own gestures, undermining its own ability. In this latter 
case, Winnicott assumed, the self ends up mimicking its care-
taking environment, resigned to the deficiency, setting aside 
creative gestures, and perhaps even forgetting they ever existed. 
Winnicott suggested that the infant compliantly relates to the 
caregiver's gestures as if they were his own, and this compliant 
stance lies at the root of the falser self-structure. It follows from 
Winnicott's view of the hallmarks of the true self that the false 
self is revealed by a lack of spontaneity or originality. It also 
follows from his understanding of how false-self-structure origi­
nates that such individuals later seek out external impinge­
ments to recreate the experience of compliant relating and, with 
it, a sense of realness about their own existence. Winnicott also 
identified the kind of self that appears to be real but is built 
on identification with early objects and thus lacks something 
uniquely its own. 
Winnicott described how ,the false self may sometimes set 
itself up as real and generally convey this impression to others, 
but it does so mechanically, lacking genuine links between inter-

nal states and actions, A self whose own constitutional state has 
not been recognized is an empty self. The emptiness reflects 
the activation of secondary representations that lack the corre­
sponding connections to affective activation within the constitu­
tional self. Emotional experience will be meaningless, and the 
individual might look for powerful others to merge with or extra-
neously caused (drug-induced) physical experiences of arousal 
to fill the vacuum with borrowed strength or ideals. Only when 
the person is challenged by the need to act spontaneously as a 
whole person, particularly in intense relationships, will the limi­
tations become evident. 
The false self is thought to serve to hide, and thus protect, the 
true self. The true self is the constitutional state that was largely 
unrepresented by parental mirroring. Thus it may emerge only 
in the course of extreme states of emotional arousal, when the 
internalized but nonreferential expression can no longer serve to 
mask emotional upheaval—for example, in the course of physical 
or psychological illness. Symptom formation may express the 
true self because historically this was how the emerging self 
found that it could exist without being overwhelmed by the 
environment, having creative gestures replaced or ignored. 
In distinguishing between deprivation and privation, Winni­
cott (1960a) brought a critical concept to an understanding of 
the influence of the environment, which is closely related to the 
current formulation of two styles of affect-mirroring. Privation is 
experienced at a stage where the infant does not have an aware­
ness of maternal care; deprivation can occur only once the infant 
becomes aware both of his own needs and of the object and is 
able to perceive environmental maladjustment. Privation occurs 
when mirroring is marked but distorted, underrnining the in­
fant's awareness of his own experience. Deprivation occurs when 
mirroring is unmarked and the caregiver's congruent affect is 
foisted on the infant without modulation. 
This distinction is crucial to our understanding of antisocial 
behavior where, in Winnicott's formulation, a certain degree of 
integration within the self has already taken place but depriva­
tion is sufficiently severe and chronic for the representation of 
the good-enough environment to be compromised (Winnicott 
1967). In these cases there is no active discouragement of the Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 197 
expression of the true self; rather, the child cannot cope with the 
failure or withdrawal of ego support, and an antisocial tendency 
develops to protect his sense of self. Capacity for concern is 
limited because the self is reorganized at a more primitive level. 
Within Winnicott's model, the capacity for concern is achieved 
only toward the end of the second year of life, when1 constructive 
and creative experiences of reparation lead the child to feel 
responsibility. Once concern has been established, the indi­
vidual can use constructive elements of aggression in the service 
of work and play. 
The perception of the self in the mind of the other becomes 
the representation of the child's experience, the representation 
of the representational world. Consistent with Winnicott's obser­
vations, the child who fails to develop a representation of an 
intentional self is likely to incorporate in his image of himself 
the representation of the other, sometimes mental, sometimes 
physical. The picture of the self will then be "false": distorted, as 
the child's experience of himself is overly influenced by his early 
perceptions of what others think and feel, and strangely out of 
touch with what he himself or others are currently experiencing. 
This may be why many neglected or maltreated children show 
apparent failures of object permanence, leading to primitive 
separation anxiety or feelings of merger with the object. In 
reality, they continue existentially to depend on the physical 
presence of the other, both for self-sustaining auxiliary reflective 
function—continuing to seek and find their intentionality in the 
mind of the other—and, more subtly, as a vehicle for the exter-
nalization of parts of the self-representation that are experienced 
as alien and incongruent with the self. This alien other is still 
internalized as part of the self-structure, but without the appro­
priate links and associations that would enable the self-repre­
sentation to function coherently. 
This state of affairs places a massive burden on those with 
severe personality disorder. In order for the self to be coherent, 
the alien and unassimilable parts require externalization: that 
is, they need to be seen as part of the other where they can be 
hated, denigrated, and often destroyed. The physical other who 
performs this function must remain present for this complex 
process to operate. The borderline child or adult cannot feel that

1967). In these cases there is no active discouragement of the Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 197 
expression of the true self; rather, the child cannot cope with the 
failure or withdrawal of ego support, and an antisocial tendency 
develops to protect his sense of self. Capacity for concern is 
limited because the self is reorganized at a more primitive level. 
Within Winnicott's model, the capacity for concern is achieved 
only toward the end of the second year of life, when1 constructive 
and creative experiences of reparation lead the child to feel 
responsibility. Once concern has been established, the indi­
vidual can use constructive elements of aggression in the service 
of work and play. 
The perception of the self in the mind of the other becomes 
the representation of the child's experience, the representation 
of the representational world. Consistent with Winnicott's obser­
vations, the child who fails to develop a representation of an 
intentional self is likely to incorporate in his image of himself 
the representation of the other, sometimes mental, sometimes 
physical. The picture of the self will then be "false": distorted, as 
the child's experience of himself is overly influenced by his early 
perceptions of what others think and feel, and strangely out of 
touch with what he himself or others are currently experiencing. 
This may be why many neglected or maltreated children show 
apparent failures of object permanence, leading to primitive 
separation anxiety or feelings of merger with the object. In 
reality, they continue existentially to depend on the physical 
presence of the other, both for self-sustaining auxiliary reflective 
function—continuing to seek and find their intentionality in the 
mind of the other—and, more subtly, as a vehicle for the exter-
nalization of parts of the self-representation that are experienced 
as alien and incongruent with the self. This alien other is still 
internalized as part of the self-structure, but without the appro­
priate links and associations that would enable the self-repre­
sentation to function coherently. 
This state of affairs places a massive burden on those with 
severe personality disorder. In order for the self to be coherent, 
the alien and unassimilable parts require externalization: that 
is, they need to be seen as part of the other where they can be 
hated, denigrated, and often destroyed. The physical other who 
performs this function must remain present for this complex 
process to operate. The borderline child or adult cannot feel that 

198 / Developmental Perspectives 
he is a self unless he has the other—often the therapist—present 
to frighten and intimidate, to seduce and excite, to humiliate and 
reduce to helplessness. The other's departure signals the return 
of these "exterojects" and the destruction of the coherence the 
child achieves by such projection. 
The alien self is present in all of us, because transient neglect 
is part of ordinary caregiving; itis pernicious when later experi­
ences of trauma in the family or the peer group force the child to 
dissociate from pain by using the alien self to identify with the 
aggressor. Hence the vacuous self comes to be colonized by the 
image of the aggressor, and the child comes to experience him­
self as evil and monstrous. In later chapters we elaborate on how 
this, in turn, leads to three important changes: (a) a repudiation 
of mentalization in an attachment context, (b) disruption of the 
psychological self by the emergence of the other within the self, 
and (c) vital dependence on the physical presence of the other as 
a vehicle for externalization. A further twist to this sequence can 
be added when later brutalization within an attachment rela­
tionship generates intense shame. Coupled with a history of 
neglect in infancy and a consequent weakness in the capacity for 
mentalization, this becomes a potent trigger for violence because 
of the intensity of the humiliation experienced when trauma 
cannot be attenuated via mentalization. Unmentalized shame is 
then experienced as the destruction of the self—we have called it 
"ego-destructive shame." The concept of "ego-destructive shame" 
plays a key role in our discussions of violence in adolescence and 
adulthood. (See chapters 8-10.) 
AFFECT-MIRRORING 
AS A MECHANISM OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION 
There is no particular reason to believe that affect-mirroring and 
its consequent effects on psychic structure-building would be 
restricted to the initial stages of development only. Contingency 
detection is likely to be a pervasive information-processing 
mechanism active over the life span, and empathic affect-reflec-

tive gestures are characteristic of adult communication as well 
as of parent-'nfant interactions. In fact, emotional mirroring can 
be identified as a potentially central mechanism of therapeutic 
change in child psychotherapy, and it has been demonstrated to 
characterize face-to-face patient-therapist interactions in adult 
psychotherapy as well (Krause 1997). 
In fact, it is tempting to suggest that the social biofeedback 
model of affect-mirroring specifies an important mediating mech­
anism underlying the therapeutic influence of so-called mirror­
ing interpretations in psychotherapy. Chapter 6 extends the 
social biofeedback model to the theory-of-mind perspective in the 
context of an assumed model of the development of psychic 
reality. Briefly, we propose the existence of two levels of repre­
sentational functioning in normal development, which we call 
the "psychic equivalence" and the "pretend" modes of mental-
izing. "Psychic equivalence" (derived from Freud's original con­
cept of psychic reality—see Freud 1900a, 1950 [1895]) refers to 
the more primitive level of mental functioning where the feelings 
and fantasies are experienced as reality and not as mental states 
representing reality. The "pretend" mode, on the other hand, 
involves an awareness of the representational, mentalistic na­
ture of experiences, which is made possible by "decoupling" the 
mental representations involved from external reality. In the 
"pretend" mode traumatic memories, threatening emotional im­
pulses, or unacceptable, fantasies can be safely activated and 
dealt with as their connection to reality has been suspended, (see 
also Freud 1920g; Gergely 1995a; Gergely and Watson 1996). 
The "pretend" mode has to be clearly marked, and the lack of 
correspondence to actual reality is frequently exaggerated (cf 
Fonagy and Fonagy 1995). We also suggest that as a precondi­
tion for the establishment of the "pretend" mode, the child needs 
to experience his feelings and thoughts being repeatedly reflected 
in a marked manner by another person. The child needs an adult 
or older child who will "play along," so that the child sees his 
fantasy or idea represented in the adult's mind, reintrojects this, 
and uses it as a representation of his own thinking. (See also our 
case illustration in chapter 7.) 
In chapter 6 we consider the psychoanalytic psychotherapy of 
a 4-year-old girl, "Rebecca." While she had already achieved the

In chapter 6 we consider the psychoanalytic psychotherapy of 
a 4-year-old girl, "Rebecca." While she had already achieved the 

200 / Developmental Perspectives 
general ability to use the "pretend" mode of rhentalizing, there 
remained in her mind an "island of psychic equivalence" related 
to the traumatic feelings and fantasies involving her unknown 
father and the recent death of a grandfather. This local arrest of 
the development of the "pretend" mode of mental functioning 
was related to her mother's inability to tolerate and reflect in a 
marked manner the child's expressions of frustration and ag­
gressive fantasies about her absent father, as the mother herself 
also tended to be stuck—in this area—in a mode of psychic 
equivalence. During analysis it proved to be possible to integrate 
this "island of psychic equivalence" into the "pretend" mode 
of mentalizing by providing marked mirroring interpretations 
about the child's feelings and thoughts within the framework of 
play therapy. 
It seems to us that our social biofeedback model of affect-
mirroring can be fruitfully applied to the above case as the 
psychological mechanism mediating both the developmental ar­
rest resulting in the "island of psychic equivalence" and the 
therapeutic intervention leading to its integration into the "pre­
tend" mode of functioning. Thus, it can be suggested that the 
little girl's mother is likely to have either systematically avoided 
affect-reflective interactions in relation to the child's expressed 
emotions concerning her absent father, or engaged in un­
marked, realistic re-presentations of the child's intense negative 
affects. This is likely to have intensified the child's traumatic 
negative emotional reactions even more, as well as leading to the 
absence of secondary marked emotion representations in this 
content area. However, since the little girl had already acquired 
the marked "pretend" mode of mentalizing in other areas of 
thought, the generalized communicative code of marked expres­
sions as indicative of decoupling and as suggestive of self-refer­
ence was available for her. As a result, through the application of 
marked mirroring interpretations of her traumatic feelings and 
fantasies in the framework of reality-decoupled play therapy, it 
became possible to establish the secondary marked representa­
tional structures that could raise the "island of psychic equi­
valence" into the safer and more tolerable "pretend" mode of 
emotional experience. Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-Mirroring / 201 
CONCLUSION 
Parental mirroring of the infant's emotion expressions seems to 
be a uniquely human instinctual propensity that has long been 
considered in both academic and psychoanalytic developmental 
psychology as playing a central role in early psychological devel­
opment. However, the various developmental functions associ­
ated with parental affect-reflective interactions have, with few 
exceptions, been based on clinical reconstruction and insight 
rather than direct evidence, and the underlying psychological 
mechanisms mediating the hypothesized developmental effects 
remained mostly unspecified. In contrast, in this chapter we 
have advanced a new theory of the nature of parental affect-
mirroring during early emotion-regulative interactions, which 
provides a specific model of the psychological processes involved 
and identifies the set of developmental functions that are served 
by these processes. 
Our social biofeedback model of parental affect-mirroring is 
specifically based on two sources of empirical evidence: it builds 
on the infant learning literature concerning contingency detec­
tion and maximization on the one hand, and on adult biofeed­
back training studies on the other. Our central proposal has 
been that by reflecting in a "marked," exaggerated form the 
infant's emotion expressive displays, the caregiver provides a 
kind of natural biofeedback sensitization training to the infant 
whose effects are mediated by the baby's sophisticated ability to 
detect and analyze response-event contingency relations. We 
have identified four separate developmental functions that are 
served by parental mirroring of affects: 
1. The sensitization function: As a result of the biofeedback 
training, the infant will become able to detect and group together 
the sets of internal-state cues that are indicative of his categori­
cally distinct dispositional emotion states. 
2. The representation-building function: By setting up separate 
representations for the parent's "marked" emotion-reflective dis­
plays that are contingent with the infant's emotion-expressive

202 / Developmental Perspectives 
behaviors, the baby establishes secondary representations that 
become associated with his primary, nonconscious, procedural 
affect states. These secondary representational structures will 
provide the cognitive means for accessing and attributing emo­
tion states to the self that will form the basis for the infant's 
emerging ability to control as well as to reason about his disposi­
tional emotion states. 
3. The state-regulation function: During empathic parental 
mirroring of the baby's negative affect expressions, the infant's 
contingency-detection device registers the high degree of contin­
gent control of the baby's emotion expressions over the care­
giver's mirroring displays. This generates a sense of causal 
efficacy and positive arousal that, through reciprocal inhibition, 
leads to a decrease of the infant's negative affect state. Further­
more, as a by-product of the infant's attempts to identify the 
maximal degree of contingent control he has over the parent's 
affect-reflective displays during soothing interactions, the baby 
will modify—in fact, reduce—his negative emotion-expressive 
behaviors, thereby also contributing to the soothing effect. 
4. The communicative and mentalizing function: By internaliz­
ing the "marked" secondary representations associated with 
primary self-states, the infant will acquire a generalized commu­
nicative code of "marked" expressions characterized by the repre­
sentational functions of referential decoupling, referential 
anchoring, and suspension of realistic consequences. This cre­
ates a new "pretend" mode of mentalizing and communicating 
about affective states that will provide the young child with 
powerful representational means of emotional self-regulation 
and expression. ;; The Development of an Understanding 
of Self and Agency 
The aim of this chapter is to present the most important discov­
eries from developmental research over the last twenty years 
that in our view pertain directly to the psychoanalytic under­
standing of self-development and have clear clinical implications 
for the treatment of individuals whose primary disturbance is 
rooted in disorganized self-representation and affect dysregu-
lation. We wish to distinguish the model of self-development and 
affect regulation proposed in this volume from other contempo­
rary developmentally grounded psychoanalytic views. We trace 
the development of mentalization from infancy and engage in 
the developmental debate about exactly when the intentional 
stance is achieved. In our view many recent contributions have 
overstated the case for early intersubjective processes in self-
development. We argue that intersubjectivity is an emergent 
phenomenon whose establishment is a function of early interac­
tive processes within an attachment context. In chapter 3 we laid 
the foundations for a model of self-development rooted in inter­
personal understanding; in this chapter this model is elaborated, 
and five stages in the development of the self as agent are 
distinguished. The chapter also lays the crucial groundwork for 
the explorations of borderline personality disorder in terms of an 
early nonmentalistic perception of causality in social actions— 
the teleological stance. Finally, the chapter gives a relatively

INTRODUCTION: EARLY UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE SELF AS AGENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW 
OF THEORY-OF-MIND DEVELOPMENT 
For a long time, the study of the "self as a mental agent" was 
a neglected topic. Historically, it has received much less atten­
tion than the other major aspect of self-knowledge that William 
James (1890) classically termed the "empirical self* or "Me" and 
which in current terminology is often called the "conceptual" or 
"categorical" self-concept or representation (Harter 1999; Lewis 
and Brooks-Gunn 1979: Neisser 1988). The "categorical self 
refers to the representation of the collection of those features 
and properties that the person believes to be true of himself 
(blue-eyed, handsome, good in math, poor soccer player, etc.) 
and that he has mostly inferred from the self-directed reactions 
of his social environment. (For a recent review, see Harter 1999.) 
The historical bias toward studying the social construction of 
the categorical self-concept rather than the Jamesian "subjective 
self" or "I" can be explained by the traditionally strong concep­
tual influence of the Cartesian doctrine of "first-person author­
ity," which claims that one has direct and infallible introspective 
access to one's own intentional mind states. The influence of 
Cartesian doctrine has encouraged the belief that the conscious 
apprehension of our mind states through introspection is a 
basic, direct, and probably prewired ability of our mind, leading 
to the conviction that knowledge of the self as a mental agent is 
an innately given rather than a developing or constructed capac­
ity. As we shall see (especially in our discussion of currently 
popular views of initial-state "intersubjectivity"), the Cartesian 
doctrine still seems to have its sway among many developmental 
researchers. However, current philosophy of mind, cognitive 
neuroscience, and developmental theory have seriously chal­
lenged the Cartesian view of the mind (Damasio 1994a; Dennett 
a An Understanding of Self and Agency / 205 
1991; Gopnik 1993; Wegner and Wheatley 1999). At the same 
time, recent philosophical (D. Davidson 1980; Searle 1983), cog­
nitive, and neuropsychological (C. D. Frith 1992; Jeannerod 
1999; Pacherie 1997; Prinz 1997) models of the representation of 
intentional action indicate that the representation of intentional 
mind states has a rather complex internal structure whose 
conscious access may be absent or only partial and may depend 
on a variety of factors (Dienes and Perner 1999). This, together 
with the demonstrations from current theory-of-mind research 
documenting an intriguingly complex developmental unfolding of 
the understanding of different types of intentional mind states— 
such as desires, intentions, and beliefs (Bartsch and Wellman 
1995; Perner 1991)—strongly indicates that the mature under­
standing of the self as a mental agent is also likely to be the 
product of rather complex developmental processes. The aim of 
this chapter, therefore, is to trace in the light of these new 
theoretical and empirical advances the different stages of the 
development of self-knowledge from the early understanding of 
physical and social agency in infancy to the more mature under­
standing of the self as a mental agent in early childhood. 
We can differentiate five levels of agency of the self, of which 
the developing human infant acquires a progressive understand­
ing: physical, social, teleological, intentional, and representa­
tional. (These were briefly introduced in chapter 3.) At the level of 
physical description, actions enter into two types of causal rela­
tions: they are related to bodies that provide their causal source 
of energy, and they have a causal impact on the environment, 
bringing about states of affairs that did not exist before. Under­
standing the self as a "physical agent," therefore, minimally 
involves some appreciation of these causal relations: the self as a 
physical entity with force that is the source of action and the self 
as an agent whose actions bring about changes in their proximal 
environment (Leslie 1994). Furthermore, starting from birth, 
human infants engage in species-specific interactions with their 
caregivers (Meltzoff and Moore 1977; Stern 1985; Trevarthen 
1979). In such exchanges the infant's displays have effects in the 
form of the behavioral reactions and emotion displays they in­
duce in their parents. Early understanding of the self as a 
"social agent" involves, therefore, at least the representation of

basic, direct, and probably prewired ability of our mind, leading 
to the conviction that knowledge of the self as a mental agent is 
an innately given rather than a developing or constructed capac­
ity. As we shall see (especially in our discussion of currently 
popular views of initial-state "intersubjectivity"), the Cartesian 
doctrine still seems to have its sway among many developmental 
researchers. However, current philosophy of mind, cognitive 
neuroscience, and developmental theory have seriously chal­
lenged the Cartesian view of the mind (Damasio 1994a; Dennett 
a An Understanding of Self and Agency / 205 
1991; Gopnik 1993; Wegner and Wheatley 1999). At the same 
time, recent philosophical (D. Davidson 1980; Searle 1983), cog­
nitive, and neuropsychological (C. D. Frith 1992; Jeannerod 
1999; Pacherie 1997; Prinz 1997) models of the representation of 
intentional action indicate that the representation of intentional 
mind states has a rather complex internal structure whose 
conscious access may be absent or only partial and may depend 
on a variety of factors (Dienes and Perner 1999). This, together 
with the demonstrations from current theory-of-mind research 
documenting an intriguingly complex developmental unfolding of 
the understanding of different types of intentional mind states— 
such as desires, intentions, and beliefs (Bartsch and Wellman 
1995; Perner 1991)—strongly indicates that the mature under­
standing of the self as a mental agent is also likely to be the 
product of rather complex developmental processes. The aim of 
this chapter, therefore, is to trace in the light of these new 
theoretical and empirical advances the different stages of the 
development of self-knowledge from the early understanding of 
physical and social agency in infancy to the more mature under­
standing of the self as a mental agent in early childhood. 
We can differentiate five levels of agency of the self, of which 
the developing human infant acquires a progressive understand­
ing: physical, social, teleological, intentional, and representa­
tional. (These were briefly introduced in chapter 3.) At the level of 
physical description, actions enter into two types of causal rela­
tions: they are related to bodies that provide their causal source 
of energy, and they have a causal impact on the environment, 
bringing about states of affairs that did not exist before. Under­
standing the self as a "physical agent," therefore, minimally 
involves some appreciation of these causal relations: the self as a 
physical entity with force that is the source of action and the self 
as an agent whose actions bring about changes in their proximal 
environment (Leslie 1994). Furthermore, starting from birth, 
human infants engage in species-specific interactions with their 
caregivers (Meltzoff and Moore 1977; Stern 1985; Trevarthen 
1979). In such exchanges the infant's displays have effects in the 
form of the behavioral reactions and emotion displays they in­
duce in their parents. Early understanding of the self as a 
"social agent" involves, therefore, at least the representation of 

206 / Developmental Perspectives 
the causal effects at a distance that species-specific communica­
tive displays can bring about in the social environment (Neisser 
1988). However, the types of causal relations that connect ac­
tions to their agents on the one hand and to the world on the 
other go beyond the level of physical description, and, corre­
spondingly, adults and young children come to understand 
much more about both of these relations as they develop. Thus, 
at around 8-9 months of age, (Tomasello 1999), infants come to 
differentiate actions from their outcomes and represent actions 
as means that function to bring about goal states. At this level 
the self is understood as a "teleological agent" (Csibra and 
Gergely 1998; Leslie 1994) who can choose among alternative 
actions the one that is most efficient in bringing about a goal 
given the constraints of a particular situation. Sometimes during 
the second year infants seem to develop an already mentalistic 
understanding of agency: they start to construe the self as an 
"intentional agent" whose actions are caused by prior intentional 
mental states such as desires (Wellman and Phillips 2000). At 
this point, they also understand that actions can change mental 
as well as physical properties of the world: for example, they 
clearly understand that a declarative pointing gesture functions 
to change the attentional state of another agent (Corkum and 
Moore 1995). At around 3 to 4 years of age this understanding of 
agency in terms of mental causation also comes to include 
the representation of epistemic mind states—such as beliefs 
(Wimmer and Perner 1983). At this stage, the young child al­
ready shows an understanding of the self as a "representational 
agent" whose actions are caused by intentional mental states 
(desires and beliefs) that are construed as representational in 
nature (Perner 1991; Wellman 1990). Related advances at 
this stage, such as the ability to understand the "causal self-
referentiality" of intentional mind states (Pacherie 1997; Perner 
2000b; Searle 1983) and the representational capacity to relate 
the memories of the self s intentional activities and experiences 
into a coherent causal-temporal organization (Povinelli and 
Eddy 1995), leads to the establishment of the—temporally— 
"extended" or "proper" self (W. James, 1890)—in other words, to 
an understanding of the "autobiographical self." As this brief 
preview indicates, the development of an understanding of self An Understanding of Self and Agency / 207 
and agency is a highly complex and currently much researched 
field of study. 
EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF THE SELF 
AS A "PHYSICAL AGENT" 
Traditionally, it was believed (Freud 191 lb; Piaget 1936} that the 
newborn baby's world is basically solipsistic and that infants are 
at first unable to differentiate between stimuli that belong to the 
self and those that belong to the environment. Such a differentia­
tion, however, seems to be a prerequisite for the development of a 
sense of physical agency, which involves representing the causal 
relationships between actions and the physical self oh the one 
hand, and actions and the external world on the other. Contem­
porary research has challenged the traditional belief in an initial 
undifferentiated state, uncovering a number of objective infor­
mation sources and corresponding innate detection mechanisms 
that provide for the direct perception of the "ecological self" 
(Butterworth 1995; Neisser 1988) as a differentiated objective 
entity moving in space among other physical objects. Following 
Gibson's (1966) ecological perspective, a series of studies demon­
strated that young infants can detect and differentiate the bodily 
self in relation to the environment on the basis of invariance 
patterns in the flow of visual information that accompanies self-
movement in space. For example, Lee and Aronson (1974) dem­
onstrated that when tested in a "moving room" (whose walls 
approach or recede), babies compensated for visually specified— 
but nonexistent—loss of balance by adjusting their body posture, 
resulting in swaying, staggering, or even falling. Follow-up stud­
ies by Butterworth and colleagues (Butterworth and Cicchetti 
1978; Butterworth and Hicks 1977) have shown that even 2-
month-olds can use visual feedback to control their head pos­
ture, showing compensatory head movements when perceiving 
visually specified instability in the moving room. Young infants 
also modify the position of their heads and/or blink when per­
ceiving an object approaching on a collision course (Dunkeld and 
Bower 1980; Pettersen, Yonas, and Fisch 1980).

Bower 1980; Pettersen, Yonas, and Fisch 1980). 

208 / Developmental Perspectives 
As discussed in some detail in chapter 4, a number of studies 
have demonstrated that young infants are highly sensitive to the 
contingent relations between their physical responses and con­
sequent stimulus events (e.g., Bahrick and Watson 1985; Field 
1979; Lewis et al. 1990; Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 1979; Papou­
sek and Papousek 1974; Rochat and Morgan 1995; Watson 
1972, 1994). As we have argued (see also Gergely and Watson 
1999), the evidence supports the view that infants possess an 
innate contingency-detection module for analyzing the degree of 
contingent relatedness between motor responses, and conse­
quent sensory events. Bahrick and Watson (1985) demonstrated 
that before 3 months of age infants show a preferential bias to 
attend to and explore perfect contingencies. Based on findings 
such as these, Watson (1994) hypothesized that the primary 
function of the contingency analyzer is that of self-detection: by 
identifying those sensory stimuli that are perfectly contingent 
with one's motor responses the module constructs a primary 
representation of the physical self as a distinct object in the 
environment. (See chapter 4 for details.) 
After 3 months of age infants start to turn their attention 
toward the less-than-perfectly contingent effects of their actions 
on the external world (Watson 1994). Piaget (1936) reported that 
from about the age of 4 months infants tend to repeat motor 
actions that result in salient changes in the external environ­
ment ("secondary circular reactions") in order to "make interest­
ing things last." Habituation studies with 5- to 6-month-olds 
(Leslie 1984; Woodward 1998) suggest that by this age infants 
discriminate grasping hands from other—inanimate—physical 
objects, attributing to them special causal powers such as trans­
porting objects through space. 
In sum, there is converging evidence that innate information-
processing devices enable infants during the first six months of 
life to represent their bodily self as a differentiated object in 
space that can initiate action and exert causal influence on its 
environment. While such a representation of the self as a physi­
cal agent certainly involves sensitivity to the causal relations 
that relate agents to actions on the one hand and actions to 
outcomes on the other, this understanding is still restricted in 
important ways at this stage. For example, awareness that ac-An Understanding of Self and Agency / 209 
tions have a causal power in bringing about salient outcomes 
does not yet involve a differentiation between goals and behav­
ioral means (Piaget 1936). This is shown by the fact that while 
infants younger than 6-8 months would repeat acts that had 
previously resulted in a salient outcome, they would not modify 
their action in response to relevant changes in the situation—for 
example, they would not make a detour around a newly inserted 
obstacle to reach an object. The ability to differentiate between 
goals and means is, however, a prerequisite for understanding 
intentional goal-directed action within a teleological framework 
(Csibra and Gergely 1998; Gergely et al. 1995; Tomasello 1995, 
1999). This involves the ability to choose from multiple alterna­
tives, whichever action realizes a goal state in the most efficient 
manner, given the changing constraints of reality. Infants start 
to organize their.behavior in relation to goal states in this ra­
tional manner only at around 8-9 months of age (Piaget 1936; 
Tomasello 1999; Willatts 1999), when they also begin to inter­
pret and predict other agents* goal-directed actions within the 
same teleological interpretive framework (Csibra and Gergely 
1998; Csibra et al. 1999). 
Apart from an early understanding of their causal power over 
the physical environment through action involving direct con­
tact, infants also show an early sensitivity to their causal 
influence over objects at a distance, as in Watson's (1972) 
mobile studies—a sensitivity mediated by the contingency-detec­
tion module (discussed in detail in chapter 4; see also Gergely 
and Watson 1999). The natural domain of such causal efficacy at 
a distance is that of social interactions, so in the next section we 
consider the origins of understanding the self as a "social agent."

A large body of evidence indicates that from the beginning 
of life infants discriminate and actively orient toward people 
(Stern 1985). They show a very early sensitivity to facial patterns

(Stern 1985). They show a very early sensitivity to facial patterns 
(Fantz 1963; Morton and Johnson 1991), they habituate to their

mothers' voice in utero and recognize it after birth (DeCasper and 
Fifer 1980), and they show neonatal imitation of facial gestures 
(Meltzoff and Moore 1977, 1989). Young infants engage in inter­
actions with their caregivers that are characterized by a 
"protoconversational" turn-taking structure (Beebe et al. 1985; 
Brazelton et al. 1974; Brazelton and Tronick 1980; Stern 1985; 
Trevarthen 1979; Tronick 1989). The currently dominant bio­
social view of emotional development holds that mother and 
infant form an affective communication system from the begin­
ning of life (Bowlby 1969; Brazelton et al. 1974; Hobson 1993; 
Sander 1970; Stern 1977, 1985; Trevarthen 1979; Tronick 1989) 
in which the mother plays a vital interactive role in modulating 
the infant's affective states. During their interactions, caregivers 
often engage in facial and vocal mirroring of their baby's displays 
of emotion in order to regulate the infant's affects (Gergely and 
Watson 1996, 1999; Malatesta and Izard 1984; Papousek and 
Papousek 1987; Stern 1985). 
Infants, therefore, seem to show an initial species-specific 
sensitivity to human facial/vocal and behavioral displays and an 
innate propensity to engage in affective interactions with care­
givers. But how do they understand such affective social interac­
tions and= their own causal role in them as social agents? There 
is a large spectrum of different theoretical views on this intrigu­
ing question. 
1. First of all, there is what we shall call the "strong inter-
subjectivist" position, which assumes (a) that human infants are 
bom with innate mechanisms to identify and attribute mental 
states such as intentions and feelings to the other's mind during 
early contingent social interactions, (b) that from the beginning 
of life there is a relatively rich set of differentiated mental states 
of the self such as emotions, intentions, motives, and goals that 
are introspectively accessible to the infant, and (c) that such 
subjective mental states of the self can be recognized as being 
similar to corresponding mental states of the other and, as such, 
are experienced as "being shared" with her (e.g., Braten 1988, 
1992; for a recent collection of papers on intersubjectivity, see 
Braten 1998; Stern 1995; Trevarthen 1979, 1993). An Understanding of Self and Agency / 211 
For example, Trevarthen (1979) claims that the richly struc­
tured early affective interactive exchanges observable between 
mothers and infants imply what he calls "primary intersubjectiv­
ity." A well-known study by Murray and Trevarthen (1985) using 
6- to 12-month-old infants as subjects is often cited as providing 
empirical support for this position. In an ingenious paradigm 
infants were observed while interacting with their mother's live 
image through a TV monitor. After a certain period, the TV image 
was switched to a noncontingent image recorded earlier of the 
mother engaged in interaction with her baby. These very young 
infants were reported to have detected the subtle change in the 
contingency structure of the interaction and reacted with 
displays of dissatisfaction and negative affect to the loss of 
maternal contingency. Trevarthen (1993) therefore proposes that 
infants are born with a dialogic mind, with an innate sense of 
"the virtual other" (see also Braten 1988) and can interpret the 
other's affectively attuned interactions in terms of a rich set of 
underlying motives, feelings, intentions, and goals. Stern also 
suggests that "from a very early age, the infant perceives inten­
tions in the self and the other, that he 'sees past* the specific 
overt behaviors in order to read in them the intentions that 
organize these behaviors" (1995, p. 420). As shown in chapter 4, 
Meltzoff and Gopnik (see 1993; Meltzoff and Moore 1997, 1998) 
also embrace the primary intersubjectivity assumption when 
they speculate that the innate "active intermodal mapping" 
mechanism that mediates neonatal imitation also functions as a 
mechanism for attributing intentional, motivational, and feeling 
states to the other during early imitative interactions. 
In contrast to advocates of the "strong intersubjectivist" 
position, a number of researchers believe that the phenomena 
of early affective and imitative social interactions can be parsi­
moniously explained without assuming "primary intersubjectiv­
ity" (e.g., Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999; R. Thompson 1998; 
Tomasello 1999). In this view, if attentiveness and reactivity to 
human facial patterns and affective displays are innate, an early 
sensitivity to the contingency structure of interactive behavioral 
exchanges and an innate propensity to imitate human facial 
gestures provide sufficient basis to explain the structured two-

organize these behaviors" (1995, p. 420). As shown in chapter 4, 
Meltzoff and Gopnik (see 1993; Meltzoff and Moore 1997, 1998) 
also embrace the primary intersubjectivity assumption when 
they speculate that the innate "active intermodal mapping" 
mechanism that mediates neonatal imitation also functions as a 
mechanism for attributing intentional, motivational, and feeling 
states to the other during early imitative interactions. 
In contrast to advocates of the "strong intersubjectivist" 
position, a number of researchers believe that the phenomena 
of early affective and imitative social interactions can be parsi­
moniously explained without assuming "primary intersubjectiv­
ity" (e.g., Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999; R. Thompson 1998; 
Tomasello 1999). In this view, if attentiveness and reactivity to 
human facial patterns and affective displays are innate, an early 
sensitivity to the contingency structure of interactive behavioral 
exchanges and an innate propensity to imitate human facial 
gestures provide sufficient basis to explain the structured two-

way affective interactions of early infancy as well as the infant's 
affective/behavioral reactions to experimentally induced pertur­
bations of the flow of contingent exchanges—for example, the 
"still-face" procedure (Tronick et al. 1978) or the delayed-feed-
back procedure of the Murray and Trevarthen (1985) paradigm. 
First, as described above, there is a good deal of evidence to 
indicate that while young infants are positively aroused when 
they find that they have a high degree of control over whether a 
stimulus event happens (Lewis et al. 1990; Watson 1972), loss of 
previously experienced contingency results in frustration and 
expressions of distress, even when the stimulus is not a human 
person (Lewis et al. 1990). Thus, sensitivity to loss of contingent 
control would seem sufficient to explain the Murray and Trevar-
then's (1985) finding discussed above. (For attributing a 
central role for social contingency perception in infancy, see also 
Bigelow, 2001; Bigelow and DeCoste, in press; Muir and Hains 
1999; Nadel and Tremblay-Leveau 1999; Rochat and Striano 
1999; Tomasello 1999.) 
Furthermore, it has proved difficult to replicate the findings of 
Murray and Trevarthen—whose original study was based on four 
2-month-old infants only—with infants under 3 months of age 
in studies using methodologically improved designs. Nadel, 
Carchon, Kervella, Marcelli, and Reserbat-Plantey (1999) did 
replicate the effect in 2-month-olds, but Rochat, Neisser, and 
Marian (1998) failed to do so in two studies using 2- to 3-month-
old infants and Bigelow and DeCoste (in press) found the effect in 
4- and 6-month-olds but also failed to replicate it with a group of 
2-month-olds. 
It is interesting to consider this pattern of findings in the light 
of Watson's (1994) hypothesis that a maturational "switch" takes 
place at around the age of 3 months in the preferred target value 
of the contingency-detection module. As we have seen, a signifi­
cant proportion of 3-month-olds in the Bahrick and Watson 
(1985) study seemed preoccupied with their perfectly contingent 
self-image (see also Field 1979), whereas 5-month-olds preferred 
to avoid the perfectly contingent display, looking more at the 
noncontingent image. Further studies by Watson suggest that 
this tendency is due to an avoidance of perfect contingencies 
rather than to a preference for noncontingency. Watson (1979, An Understanding of Self and Agency / 213 
1985) aimed to identify the preferred degree of contingency after 
3 months of age. He examined 4- to 6-month-olds' reactions to 
different magnitudes of response-stimulus contingencies in the 
range from slightly greater than 0 to slightly less than 1 (in terms 
of conditional probability). He found that at this age infants have 
great difficulty with contingency magnitudes that are less than 
0.5. At the same time, they also failed to engage contingencies 
that approached a magnitude of 1. In contrast, the infants were 
very motivated to engage high-but-imperfect contingencies. 
As discussed in chapter 4, Watson (Gergely and Watson 1999; 
Watson 1994) therefore hypothesized that at around 3 months 
the target value of the contingency analyzer in normal infants is 
"switched" to a preference for high-but-imperfect contingencies 
that are characteristic of the infant-directed reactive behaviors 
of well-attuned social objects. This maturational change func­
tions to orient the infant after 3 months of age away from self-
exploration (perfect contingencies) and toward the exploration 
and representation of the social world. These assumptions raise 
the possibility that before 3 months of age the degree of contin­
gency provided by parental interactions may not be high enough 
for its disappearance to be detected by the infant when the 
parent continues to display similar interactive but noncontin­
gent behavior. This, then, may explain the difficulty found in 
several studies of replicating the Murray and Trevarthen (1985) 
finding under 3 months of age (cf. Bigelow, 2001). Some recent 
findings provide further support for the position that infants 
around 3 months of age are in a transitional period in which 
sensitivity to high-but-imperfect social contingencies begins to 
emerge. Even though in the Bigelow and DeCoste (in press) study 
the 2-month-olds as a group did not distinguish between contin­
gent and noncontingent displays, approximately half of the 
infants did show a decrease in visual attention to the noncontin­
gent display when they were examined individually. Further­
more, Legerstee and Varghese (2001), using a similar paradigm, 
reported that a subgroup of their sample of 3-month-olds whose 
mothers were warm, sensitive, and attuned to the infants' cues' 
in their interactions reacted with more visual attention, smiling, 
and melodic vocalizations to the contingent than to the non-
contingent displays. Infants of mothers who scored low on these

214 / Developmental Perspectives 
measures, however, showed no such differentiation between the 
two types of displays. It seems likely that the mothers in the 
attuned, highly responsive group provided degrees of contingent 
reactivity that were high enough for their 3-month-old infants 
to detect, and so the sudden loss of contingency in the non-
contingent display became discriminable for these babies. This 
finding also supports the argument, more fully explicated in 
chapter 3,^ that the level of sensitivity manifested by,the caregiver 
influences the rate at which the child acquires the capacity to 
exert control over its internal states. 
The second objection to the "strong intersubjectivist" position 
concerns its assumption that innate mechanisms identify and 
attribute intentional and emotional states to the minds of oth­
ers. Two types of prewired architecture for accessing subjective 
mental states of others can be imagined to accomplish this task: 
{a) direct perception through' innately specified* triggering dis­
plays, and (b) inferential access to the other's subjective states 
through motor simulation. 
Some researchers have indeed claimed that newborn infants 
can differentiate among a set of discrete basic-emotion expres­
sions (Field et al. 1983; Haviland and Lelwica 1987; Izard and 
Malatesta 1987) such as happiness, surprise, or sadness. How­
ever, later research (C. Nelson 1987) has questioned whether the 
babies are really differentiating between emotions or, rather, 
between some other non-emotion-specific perceptual features. 
For example, Caron, Caron, and Myers (1985) demonstrated that 
4- to 7-month-olds could differentiate between toothy and non-
toothy emotion expressions, but they could not differentiate 
between angry and happy expressions if both of them showed 
teeth. Caron, Caron, and MacLean (1988) also showed that 
4-month-olds could not discriminate happy from sad dynamic 
facial/vocal expressions, and 5-month-olds failed to do so with 
happy and angry displays. Such findings suggest-that even if one 
accepts the notion that there is a set of universal, prewired, 
discrete facial emotion expressions (Ekman 1992b; Izard 1991; 
Malatesta and Izard 1984), there seems to be no compelling 
evidence that infants can discriminate between such emotion-
expressive facial patterns in others before 5 to 6 months of age. An Understanding of Self and Agency / 215 
Apart from facial emotion expressions, some innatist thinkers 
have proposed that certain types of behavioral cues, such as 
self-propelled movement or direction of movement, automatically 
trigger attribution of intentionality or goal to other agents (Leslie 
1994; Premack 1990; Premack and Premack 1995). However, 
recent habituation studies (Csibra et al. 1999) and elicited gaze-
following studies (Johnson, Slaughter, and Carey 1998) have 
demonstrated that while such cues may be informative, they are 
neither necessary nor sufficient for triggering goal attribution 
even in 9- and 12-month-old infants. 
The alternative to the idea that infants perceive emotions 
directly through innate releasers is the suggestion that they can 
infer the other's intentions and feelings by generating and ex­
periencing them through motor simulation. As we have seen, 
Meltzoff and his colleagues (Meltzoff and Gopnik 1993; Meltzoff 
and Moore 1989) have proposed such a mechanism in their 
"active intermodal mapping" account of neonatal imitation. Their 
use of this mechanism to explain not only the fact of infantile 
imitation per se but.also the assumed fact of attributing subjec­
tive mental states to the other requires some further strong 
innatist assumptions about the extent to which infants are able 
to differentiate between intentional and emotional self-states on 
the one hand, and about the introspective accessibility of such 
differentiated mental states on the other. Thus, the "strong 
intersubjectivist" view implies [a) that imitation of the other's 
expressive displays induces corresponding emotional and inten­
tional self-states (the Correspondence Assumption), (b) that the 
self-states generated by motor simulation are directly accessible 
to the infant through introspection (the Primary Access and Self-
Awareness Assumption), and (c) that the infant attributes sub­
jective internal states to the other's mind by consulting his own 
felt subjective state, which is generated by his imitation (the 
Other Mind Assumption). 
There is very little evidence to support any of these assump­
tions, however. For example, do infants experience the same 
types of emotion states the expression of which they observe in 
their mothers during early affective interactions? Even though

and Izard 1984) claim that—using the MAX (Izard 1979) or the 
AFFEX (Izard, Dougherty, and Hembree 1983) coding systems— 
expressions of emotions such as fear, anger, or sadness can be 
objectively differentiated in early infancy, others (Oster, Hegley, 
and Nagel 1992) using a different coding system, the Baby-FACS 
(Oster and Rosenstein, in press), dispute this claim and argue 
that young babies' negative expressions show only undifferenti­
ated distress at first. Camras (1992) pointed out that the con­
ditions that induce particular emotion expressions in young 
babies are often idiosyncratic and unexpected, as in the case of a 
1-month-old who expressed sadness when eating a sour vitamin. 
Recently, Camras (2000) reviewed a number of further empirical 
phenomena that raise problems for the view that babies* expres­
sions of emotion are linked to internal feelings like those that 
adults experience and that these expressions will be prompted 
by the same kinds of stimuli as those to which adults react. 
In fact, many emotion researchers believe that babies are not 
yet able to differentiate emotions and/or do not yet have con­
scious access to them during the first few months: they argue 
that these abilities are the consequence of early self-organizing 
dynamic systems processes (Fogel et al. 1992; Lewis and Granic 
2000) or early socialization of emotions during affective interac­
tions (Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999; Sroufe 1979, 1996), as 
well as cognitive development (Barrett and Campos 1987; Kagan 
1992; Lewis and Brooks 1978; Lewis and Michaelson 1983). 
There are two alternative theoretical approaches, both com­
patible with the above criticisms of the "strong intersubjectivist" 
view: (a) one that can be called the "weak intersubjectivist" 
position, and (b) one that we will call the "no starting-state 
intersubjectivism" position. 
2. The "weak intersubjectivist" position (see Tomasello 1999) 
accepts that the existence of early affective and imitative inter­
actions reflects a specifically human biological adaptation to 
"identifying" with other persons as "like me." In Tomasello's 
simulation theory the human propensity for "identification" 
plays a crucial role in the developing understanding of other 
minds insofar as the infant comes to understand—and attribute 
subjective states to—the other through analogy to the internally An Understanding of Self and Agency / 217 
experienced subjective mental states of the self. However, 
Tomasello emphasizes that "in attempting to understand other 
persons human infants apply what they already experience of 
themselves— . . . [but] this experience of the self changes in 
early development, especially with regard to self-agency" (1999, 
p. 70). Thus, Tomasello differs significantly from proponents of 
the "strong intersubjectivist" position in that he believes that 
before 9 months of age infants do not yet have a differentiated 
understanding of their own subjective internal states such as 
intentions or goals, and so they cannot understand such inten­
tional states in others either.-As he puts it: "Some researchers, 
especially Trevarthen, believe that these early interactions are 
'intersubjective*, but in my view they cannot be intersubjective 
until infants understand others as subjects of experience— 
which they will not do until nine months of age" (p. 59). 
Some of Meltzoff s writings seem also to be best interpreted 
within the "weak intersubjectivist" framework. For example, 
Meltzoff and Moore suggest that "infants progress from concep­
tions of others as entities with whom one can share actions to 
persons with whom one can share goals and intentions" (1998, 
p. 49). They also state that "newborns are not isolated from 
others at birth, but... do not yet understand the internal 
feelings and mental states of others in the way a 2-year-old does" 
(p. 49). Thus, although these views of "weak intersubjectivity" 
assume an innate mechanism for identification with other hu­
mans, this mechanism can only result in attributing subjective 
mental states to the other if the corresponding subjective states 
have already been established and can be consciously accessed 
in the self. 
3. Our third theoretical alternative, the "no starting-state inter­
subjectivism" position, raises a further objection to the functions 
that proponents of initial-state intersubjectivity tend to attribute 
to early affective/communicative and imitative exchanges. It is 
often assumed that infants and caregivers engage in such inter­
actions in order to "share or participate in" each other's subjec­
tive affective and intentional states or to "discover" the subjective 
world of intentions and feelings of the other (Meltzoff and Gopnik 
1993; Stern 1985; Trevarthen 1979). These assumed functions

tions for such early interactions that do not require the assump­
tion of this ability: (a) The infant's innate readiness to engage in 
affective interactions with caregivers may function to establish 
and maintain proximity to the attachment figure (Bowlby 1969), 
as the infant's reactivity is highly reinforcing to the caregiver, 
(b). Infants' innate propensity to engage parents in affective inter­
changes contributes to affective self-regulation in two ways: the 
baby experiences and maintains positive arousal through the 
direct affect-regulative influence of interaction with the parent 
and, if contingent control over the parent's behaviors is detected 
(see above), the baby also experiences feelings of causal efficacy, 
(c) Finally, innate social reactivity may have the evolutionary 
function of creating a facilitating learning environment—in the 
form of the infant-directed affect-expressive and mirroring dis­
plays of the parent—in which learning about the dispositional 
displays of others, sensitization to intentional and affective self-
states, and the establishment of secondary representations for 
primary emotion states of the self are optimized (cf. Fonagy 
2000; Gergely, Koos, and Watson, in press; Gergely and Watson 
1996, 1999). This argument was vigorously advanced in chapter 
3 of the present volume. To state the argument explicated in 
detail in that chapter more generally, we believe that a strong 
case can be made for the early interactions between infant and 
caregiver as having a primary biological function of facilitating 
the development of the mental mechanisms essential for the 
establishment of a sense of subjectivity and the interpersonal 
interpretive processes that underpin self-agency. At the heart of 
this argument is the view that subjectivity in the infant cannot 
be assumed but, rather, must be considered as acquired in the 
process of interaction. 
For example, Gergely and Watson (1996, 1999; Gergely, Koos, 
and Watson, in press) have proposed that instead of providing a 
vehicle for intersubjective communication between minds, early 
contingent affect-regulative interactions serve—among a number 
of other functions—to establish one important precondition for 
later intersubjectivity: namely, the introspective accessibility of An Understanding of Self and Agency / 219 
differentiated emotional and intentional states of the self. Con­
trary to the classical Cartesian view, the "social biofeedback 
theory of parental affect-mirroring" outlined in chapter 4 as­
sumes that infants initially lack introspective awareness of dif­
ferential basic-emotion states. It is suggested that the perceptual 
system is set with a bias to attending to and exploring the 
external world and that it builds representations primarily based 
on stimuli received from the outside. Babies become sensitive to 
the distinctive internal patterns of physiological and visceral 
stimulation that accompany discrete emotion expressions 
through the application of the contingency-detection mechanism 
to the contingent relation between the automatic emotion ex­
pressions of the infant on the one hand, and the caregiver's 
consequent affect-reflective facial/vocal displays on the other. 
The clinical relevance of this is considerable. If the mirroring 
of internal states is dysfunctional, internal states will be unla-
belled, confusing, and experienced as unsymbolized and there­
fore difficult to regulate. The case of "Emma" described in 
chapter 10 might be an example of this phenomenon. As we 
shall see in chapter 6, the interactive origins of the sense of 
subjective self-states can account for substantial differences 
between the ways children interpret their subjective experiences 
and ultimately perhaps even clinical conditions that are strongly 
linked to distorted interpretations of internal states such as 
certain types of panic disorders. 
To conclude—there is no compelling evidence to support the 
intersubjectivist notion that structured affective mother-infant 
interactions during the first months of life involve an ability on 
the part of young infants to access their own differentiated 
mental states introspectively or that they are able to attribute 
corresponding subjective intentional and feeling states to the 
other's mind. Of course, this is not to deny that during such 
attuned or imitative interactions mother and infant may experi­
ence similar subjective states. However, in our view such "affect 
sharing" can, at best, be called "objective intersubjectivity," be­
cause although the subjective states of parent and infant may 
become aligned due to empathic parental mirroring or infantile 
imitation of parental affect expressions, this does not imply that

220 / Developmental Perspectives 
the young infant is aware of sharing the subjective state with the 
other,-or, for that matter, that the other experiences a subjective 
state at all. 
How, then, can we characterize young infants' experience of 
their social agency during early affect-regulative interactions 
-with their caregivers? We have seen that after 3 months of age 
infants begin to be most interested in interactions where the 
degree of contingency of stimuli on their responses is high but 
imperfect (Watson 1994). Since attuned and imitative interac­
tions with the caregiver provide such rich—but imperfect—con­
tingencies, we can assume that infants' discovery of their high 
degree of contingent control over their caregivers' reactions posi­
tively arouses them and gives them feelings of causal efficacy. 
They are also likely to experience the pleasurable changes in 
their affective states that the parent's affect-modulating soothing 
interactions bring about (and become associated with—see 
Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999) . Since such attuned interac­
tions often involve affect-miiToring, infants may come to associ­
ate the control they have over their parent's mirroring displays 
with the ensuing positive change in their affect state, leading to 
an experience of the self as a self-regulating-agent (Gergely and 
Watson 1996, 1999; Gergely et al. in press). Whether at this 
stage infants experience more differentiated, discrete emotions 
or intentions and goals with specific contents is currently uncer­
tain, but clearly the evidence available at the present time does 
not call for such an assumption. 
At what point in infancy does "true" intersubjective under­
standing of other minds begin, then? One clear sign of under­
standing the other's subjective feeling state while differentiating 
it from one's own comes with the appearance of mature em­
pathic reactions at some point during the second part of the 
second year (Hoffman 2000; R. Thompson 1998). Understanding 
others' intentional mental states, such as their attention, desire, 
or intention, also becomes dominant during the second year 
of life (Bartsch and Wellman 1995; Corkum and Moore 1995; 
Wellman 1990), though these abilities first start to emerge be­
tween 9 and 12 months of age when the set of so-called joint-
attention skills first appears (Carpenter et al. 1998; Tomasello 
1999). Some of these skills—such as protodeclarattve pointing, a An Understanding of Self and Agency / 221 
communicative gesture whose goal is to modify the other's men­
tal state of attention—seem to imply an ability to attribute at 
least some type of intentional mental states to others, whereas 
others—such as protoimperative pointing or imitative learning— 
may be explained in a still nonmentalistic teleological interpre­
tive framework (see below; see also Gergely and Csibra 2000). 
An important theoretical question, then, concerns the way in 
which the innate propensity of human infants to engage in 
affective and imitative interactions with caregivers during the 
first 6 to 9 months of life may be related to the later emergence of 
the intersubjective mentalistic stance starting at around 1 year 
of age. We have reviewed three positions: (a) The "strong inter­
subjectivist" view (Trevarthen 1979) holds that such early affec­
tive communicative exchanges are examples of an already fully 
functioning mind-reading capacity present from birth, (b) The 
"weak intersubjectivist" position considers such early affective 
interactions as evidence for the presence of a human specific 
innate mechanism specialized to "identify" with the subjective 
perspective of other human persons. This view holds, however, 
that the simulation of differentiated intentional mind states of 
others by this mechanism becomes possible only at around 9 
months of age. This is so because certain types of intentional 
mind states of the self do not become differentiated and intro-
spectively accessible to serve as the basis for attributing corre­
sponding subjective states to others until this age is reached 
(Tomasello 1999). (c) Finally, we considered the "no starting-
state intersubjectivism" view. This position holds -that early 
affect-regulative and imitative interactions serve a number of 
important evolutionary functions (such as proximity mainte­
nance and affect regulation), but that these functions do not 
involve, on the infant's part, the ability to read and attribute 
subjective mental states to others. However, it is hypothesized 
that one of these evolutionary functions has a relationship to the 
later emerging intersubjective mentalistic stance in that it helps 
to establish one of its preconditions: the cognitive accessibility of 
the infant's own discrete emotional and intentional mind states 
(Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999). In this view, early affect-
regulative mirroring interaction with the caregiver provides an 
environment in which, through the processes of contingency

UNDERSTANDING SELF AND OTHER 
AS "TELEOLOGICAL AGENTS": 
THE NINE-MONTH SOCIAL-COGNITIVE REVOLUTION 
A large body of evidence indicates that by 9 months of age 
infants develop a qualitatively new level of understanding of 
goal-directed action (e.g., Csibra et al. 1999; Piaget 1936; Toma­
sello 1999; Uzgiris and Hunt 1975; Willatts 1999). This has been 
aptly referred to as the 9-month social-cognitive revolution 
(Rochat and Striano 1999; Tomasello 1999). This new capacity 
involves the ability to differentiate goals from the means that 
bring them about, to modify an action to suit a.new situation, 
and to choose the means that bring about the goal in the most 
efficient manner from the available options. Piaget (1936) de­
scribed the first appearance of such intentional coordinated 
means-end behaviors between 7 and 9 months of age (Stage IV). 
Before this stage, infants would repeat previously successful 
action schemes to recreate salient effects; however, they would 
fail to adjust and vary their actions to fit the requirements of 
changing circumstances. For example, when an obstacle was 
placed between the infant and the goal object, 4- to 6-month-
olds would either simply give up or start acting on the obstacle 
itself, seemingly becoming oblivious of the goal object, whereas 
8-month-olds would already proceed to remove the obstacle in a 
deliberate manner in order to reach for and grasp the desired 
object (Piaget 1936; Willatts 1999). An Understanding of Self and Agency / 223 
Recently, Gergely, Csibra, and their colleagues (Csibra et al. 
1999; Gergely and Csibra 1998; Gergely et al. 1995; see also 
Woodward and Sommerville, 2000) have demonstrated in a se­
ries of visual habituation studies that at the same time as they 
become capable of means-end coordination in producing inten­
tional goal-directed' actions, infants also start to interpret the 
actions of others as goal-directed and rational. For example, 9-
and 12-month'Olds—but not 6-month-olds—were shown to in­
terpret, the behavior of an abstract computer-animated figure as 
goal-directed and could infer its novel action in a new situation. 
Infants were habituated to an event in which a small circle 
repeatedly approached a large circle by "jumping over" a rectan­
gle separating them. In the test phase, when the "obstacle" was 
removed, infants looked longer if the small circle repeated its 
familiar jumping action—which, given the absence of the "obsta­
cle," was no longer seen as a "sensible" goal approach—than 
when it took a novel more efficient straight-line route (rational 
approach). No such looking-time differences were found, how­
ever, in a control condition that differed only in that there was 
no "obstacle" in the habituation phase to start with—and so the 
small circle approached the large one in a nonrational manner 
by jumping over nothing. This suggests that infants attributed 
the end state (contacting the large circle) as the goal of the action 
only if the action (the jumping approach) was evaluated as a 
rational or efficient means to bring about the outcome state 
given the constraints of the situation (i.e., the presence of the 
"obstacle"). 
On the basis of these results, Gergely and Csibra (1997; 
Csibra and Gergely 1998) proposed that by 9 months of age 
infants come to interpret goal-directed spatial behavior in terms 
of a "teleological stance" or a "naive theory of rational action." 
Teleological explanations differ from causal ones in two respects: 
(a) The explanatory element referred to is in a different temporal 
relation to the to-be-explained action. Teleological interpreta­
tions refer to the outcome that follows the action, whereas 
causal explanations point at some necessary condition that is 
prior to the event, (b) They use different criteria of acceptance.

tates the action providing its generative source. In contrast, 
reference to the outcome state is accepted as a teleological 
explanation (reason) for a behavior when it justifies it—that is, 
when, given the constraints of reality, the behavior can be seen 
as a sensible way to bring about the goal state. 
The teleological interpretive system represents goal-directed 
action by establishing an explanatory relation.among three rep­
resentational elements: the action (A), the goal state (G), and the 
relevant constraints of physical reality (RC)—in the above case, 
the presence or absence of an obstacle. Such teleological repre­
sentations are based on the "principle of rational action," which 
assumes that agents pursue their goals in the most rational or 
efficient manner available to them given the constraints of physi­
cal reality. Gergely and Csibra have shown that, relying on the 
principle of rational action, 1-year-olds can infer any one of the 
three representational elements (A, G, or RC) given perceptual 
information about the other two. (See Csibra et al. 1999; Csibra, 
Biro, Koos, and Gergely, 2002; Gergely and Csibra 1998, 2000.) 
Adults tend to describe the goal-directed jumping action in 
mentalistic terms such as "it wants to get to the other circle and 
thinks that the obstacle is impenetrable, so it jumps over it" (cf. 
Heider and Simmel 1944). However, it is possible to make a 
viable teleological interpretation without such mentalistic attri­
butions. The interpretation works even if it makes reference only 
-to -the relevant states of current reality, such as the presence of 
an obstacle, that constrain the goal approach and to future 
reality—the goal state of contacting the large circle—as repre­
sented by the infant himself. Thus, infants could construct a 
viable teleological action interpretation or prediction without 
attributing prior desires and beliefs to the actor's mind. Gergely 
and Csibra (1997; Csibra and Gergely 1998) hypothesize, there­
fore, that in its initial form the infant's "teleological stance" 
generates reality-based representations for goal-directed actions 
that are neither mentalistic nor causal.1 
1 The representational requirements of the "teleological stance" correspond to 
those of the second level of Leslie's modularist theory of Agency (ToMM/Sys-
teml), which represents the actional properties of agents in terms of teleological 
causality" (Leslie 1995J. In Leslie's view, however, teleological interpretation of 
action is triggered by innately specified stimulus cues such as self-propelled An Understanding of Self and Agency / 225 
In chapter 9 we construct a developmental psychopathology 
model that has the notion of the teleological stance at its core. To 
anticipate these discussions, we shall argue that individuals 
whose use of the intentional stance is only partially accessible or 
is blocked by either biological deficits or social experiences 
beyond the normal range frequently revert to the teleological 
stance in their interpretations of interpersonal behavior, par­
ticularly in the attachment context. It is important to note that 
such a dominance of the teleological construal of social reality is 
thought to be more likely in those individuals for whom the 
building blocks of the intentional stance, such as the second-
order representations of primary constitutional self-states, were 
not firmly established in the first place. 
The 9-month social-cognitive revolution also manifests itself 
in the emergence of a set of qualitatively new communicative 
behaviors: goal-directed coordinated activities between infants 
and parents involving joint attention to objects or situations 
(Carpenter et al. 1998; Corkum and Moore 1995; Tomasello 
1995; Trevarthen and Hubley 1978). At this stage infants start to 
follow the adult's gaze reliably (gaze following), actively attend to 
the adult's facial and vocal attitude expressions about unfamiliar 
objects or situations to modify their own behavior (social refer­
encing), and act on objects in the way adults are acting on them 
(imitative learning). They also begin to use communicative ges­
tures themselves (such as pointing or object showing) in order to 
direct adults' attention and behavior to objects or situations 
(imperative and declarative gestures). Carpenter et al. (1998) 
have demonstrated that this series of "joint-attention skills" 
(including protoimperative and protodeclarative gestures, imita­
tive learning, cooperative learning, and intentional teaching), 
movement (Leslie 1994) that identify the actor as a physical agent with internal 
"force." In the alternative modularist approaches of Premack (1990) and Baron-
Cohen (1994) self-propulsion directly triggers the categorization of the actor as 
an intentional agent. In contrast to these proposals. Csibra et al. (1999) provided 
evidence indicating that movement cues of agency or animacy are neither neces­
sary nor sufficient for teleological interpretation to occur. In their view, goal 
attribution is based on the applicability of the principle of rational action rather 
than the perception of innately specified stimulus cues, and a teleological 
interpretation is set up as a result of the perception of justifiable adjustment of 
behavior as a function of situational constraints.

tates the action providing its generative source. In contrast, 
reference to the outcome state is accepted as a teleological 
explanation (reason) for a behavior when it justifies it—that is, 
when, given the constraints of reality, the behavior can be seen 
as a sensible way to bring about the goal state. 
The teleological interpretive system represents goal-directed 
action by establishing an explanatory relation.among three rep­
resentational elements: the action (A), the goal state (G), and the 
relevant constraints of physical reality (RC)—in the above case, 
the presence or absence of an obstacle. Such teleological repre­
sentations are based on the "principle of rational action," which 
assumes that agents pursue their goals in the most rational or 
efficient manner available to them given the constraints of physi­
cal reality. Gergely and Csibra have shown that, relying on the 
principle of rational action, 1-year-olds can infer any one of the 
three representational elements (A, G, or RC) given perceptual 
information about the other two. (See Csibra et al. 1999; Csibra, 
Biro, Koos, and Gergely, 2002; Gergely and Csibra 1998, 2000.) 
Adults tend to describe the goal-directed jumping action in 
mentalistic terms such as "it wants to get to the other circle and 
thinks that the obstacle is impenetrable, so it jumps over it" (cf. 
Heider and Simmel 1944). However, it is possible to make a 
viable teleological interpretation without such mentalistic attri­
butions. The interpretation works even if it makes reference only 
-to -the relevant states of current reality, such as the presence of 
an obstacle, that constrain the goal approach and to future 
reality—the goal state of contacting the large circle—as repre­
sented by the infant himself. Thus, infants could construct a 
viable teleological action interpretation or prediction without 
attributing prior desires and beliefs to the actor's mind. Gergely 
and Csibra (1997; Csibra and Gergely 1998) hypothesize, there­
fore, that in its initial form the infant's "teleological stance" 
generates reality-based representations for goal-directed actions 
that are neither mentalistic nor causal.1 
1 The representational requirements of the "teleological stance" correspond to 
those of the second level of Leslie's modularist theory of Agency (ToMM/Sys-
teml), which represents the actional properties of agents in terms of teleological 
causality" (Leslie 1995J. In Leslie's view, however, teleological interpretation of 
action is triggered by innately specified stimulus cues such as self-propelled An Understanding of Self and Agency / 225 
In chapter 9 we construct a developmental psychopathology 
model that has the notion of the teleological stance at its core. To 
anticipate these discussions, we shall argue that individuals 
whose use of the intentional stance is only partially accessible or 
is blocked by either biological deficits or social experiences 
beyond the normal range frequently revert to the teleological 
stance in their interpretations of interpersonal behavior, par­
ticularly in the attachment context. It is important to note that 
such a dominance of the teleological construal of social reality is 
thought to be more likely in those individuals for whom the 
building blocks of the intentional stance, such as the second-
order representations of primary constitutional self-states, were 
not firmly established in the first place. 
The 9-month social-cognitive revolution also manifests itself 
in the emergence of a set of qualitatively new communicative 
behaviors: goal-directed coordinated activities between infants 
and parents involving joint attention to objects or situations 
(Carpenter et al. 1998; Corkum and Moore 1995; Tomasello 
1995; Trevarthen and Hubley 1978). At this stage infants start to 
follow the adult's gaze reliably (gaze following), actively attend to 
the adult's facial and vocal attitude expressions about unfamiliar 
objects or situations to modify their own behavior (social refer­
encing), and act on objects in the way adults are acting on them 
(imitative learning). They also begin to use communicative ges­
tures themselves (such as pointing or object showing) in order to 
direct adults' attention and behavior to objects or situations 
(imperative and declarative gestures). Carpenter et al. (1998) 
have demonstrated that this series of "joint-attention skills" 
(including protoimperative and protodeclarative gestures, imita­
tive learning, cooperative learning, and intentional teaching),

emerges in a coordinated fashion between the ages of 9 and 15 
months in human infants. 
On the basis of this evidence, Tomasello (1995, 1999) has 
developed an alternative theory to capture the nature of infants' 
emerging capacity to interpret rational goal-directed action, pro­
posing that at around 9 months of age infants start using a 
qualitatively new interpretational system to understand other 
persons. He calls this the "intentional stance." Tomasello (1999) 
argues that the set of joint-attention skills emerging at the end of 
the first year—as well as infants' performance in the Csibra-
Gergely type of habituation tasks)—are different behavioral man­
ifestations of the same underlying new understanding of other 
persons as intentional agents. 
According to Tomasello (1999), the emergence of the inten­
tional stance depends on two factors. First, it presupposes the 
ability to differentiate goal states from the means leading to 
them (Piaget 1936) as well as the related capacity to choose the 
most rational or efficient action from the set of alternatives 
available in a given situation, to realize the goal (cf. Gergely et al. 
1995). In Tomasello's view, as soon as infants can represent 
their goals separately from their action schemes and start to 
show flexible means-end coordination, they immediately also 
become able to interpret other agents* goal-directed behavior in 
terms of intentions and rational choice of means. This inference 
is made possible by the second component of Tomasello's theory: 
he assumes that infants are born with the ability to "identify" 
with other humans who are "just like them" and attribute sub­
jective intentional states to them through analogy to their own 
self-experience. Therefore, the simultaneous emergence by 9 
months of means-end coordination in action production on the 
one hand, and the ability to understand intentional goal-directed 
action in others on the other, is explained by the fact that 
infants become able to simulate the intentional actions of others 
in terms of goal attribution and rational choice of means only 
when they themselves have achieved a differentiated and coordi­
nated representation of their own intentional actions in terms of 
goals and available means. 
When comparing Gergely and Csibra's "teleological stance" 
account with Tomasello's "intentional stance" account of the 9-An Understanding of Self and Agency / Til 
month social-cognitive revolution, we can identify three—clearly 
related—theoretical issues that differentiate the two approaches. 
These concern (a) the role of simulation, (b) the mechanisms for 
understanding self versus other as goal-directed agents, and (c) 
the issue of mentalism. 
1. The role of simulation in understanding others as goal-
directed agents—full simulation versus default simulation. Simu-
lationist theories of understanding intentional action tend to 
assume that mental states such as desires or intentions are 
attributed to others to the extent that the other's behavior is 
perceived as "just like me." An often cited example is Meltzoffs 
(1995) important demonstration that 18-month-olds infer and 
reenact an underlying intention when observing a human mod­
el's failed attempts at realizing it, but they do not do so if the 
same acts are performed by a robot—which does not behave in a 
"just like me" manner. However, in habituation studies that 
involve no imitation, Gergely and Csibra (1998; Csibra and Ger­
gely 1998; Csibra et al. 2002) demonstrated that already at 12 
months infants can infer the goal of an incomplete action, even 
when the actor is not human but a computer-animated 2D disk 
with no facial features or biomechanical movement characteris­
tics. In fact, Csibra and colleagues (1999) showed goal attribu­
tion as early as 9 months of age even when the actor's (again a 
2D disk) behavior was lacking all animacy or agency cues such 
as self-propelled, irregular, and biomechanical movement that 
could be expected to trigger a "just like me" judgment. These 
findings suggest, therefore, that early goal attribution may, in 
fact, not be restricted to humans or animate agents. (See also 
Johnson et al. 1998.) Why is it, then, that Meltzoffs 18-month-
old subjects did not imitate the inanimate robot whose behavior 
could have suggested goal-directedness? Csibra and colleagues 
(1999) suggested that this may be because it is Imitation rather 
than goal attribution that is restricted to human action only. In 
fact, Legerstee (1991) provided evidence suggesting that when 
presented with analogous actions performed by humans versus 
inanimate objects, infants imitate only the human model. 
The above findings suggest that early goal attribution may be 
a rather general process that is—at least initially—not restricted

The above findings suggest that early goal attribution may be 
a rather general process that is—at least initially—not restricted 

228 / Developmental Perspectives 
to the domain of persons or animate agents whose surface 
behavior warrants a "just like me" judgment. This, in turn, 
suggests that simulation through analogy to the self may not 
be the only—or, for that matter, the most central—mechanism 
through which interpretation of goal-directed intentional actions 
of others is mediated. 
In contrast to Tomasello's "intentional stance," Gergely and 
Csibra's "teleological stance" is not based primarily on simula­
tion. Rather, the infant's "naive theory of rational action" is seen 
as directly applicable to goal-directed actions, whether these are 
performed by the other or by the self. A central component of the 
theory is the principle of rational action that drives the process 
of evaluating whether the observed action constitutes an effi­
cient means of bringing about the end state in the particular 
situation. This judgment is made in the light of the infant's 
available knowledge about situational constraints—such as the 
impenetrability of a solid obstacle^-and about biological and 
dispositional constraints that characterize the actor. To illus­
trate this latter point: while a straight-line approach to a goal 
may be judged as the most efficient means for a human actor, a 
hopping approach may be seen as more appropriate in the case 
of a kangaroo, assuming that the infant knows that kangaroos 
have an overriding disposition to hop. Thus, relevant informa­
tion about the agent can influence the evaluation of rational 
goal-directed action even if such properties do not correspond to 
those of the self. 
Nevertheless, simulation also plays an important role in Ger­
gely and Csibra's teleological model; we can call this "default 
simulation." If no previous knowledge or current perceptual evi­
dence is available about the dispositional constraints of the 
agent, the infant will simulate the agent by default as being 
similar to—and so being subject to the same constraints on 
possible action as—the self. However, simulation is only a de­
fault option to fall back on when lacking relevant information 
about the other. In fact, Csibra and Gergely (1998) have recently 
demonstrated that perceptual information about the agent's dis­
positions can indeed modify the infant's expectations about what 
particular goal approach the agent will follow. An Understanding of Self and Agency / 229 
2. Understanding the self versus the other. A corollary to Toma­
sello's simulationist account is his view that before infants can 
understand the other's behavior as intentional and goal-directed, 
they must first achieve means-end differentiation of action 
schemes and their effects in relation to their own actions prima­
rily on the basis of introspective evidence—such as feelings of 
intentional effort (Piaget 1936; Tomasello 1999). For Tomasello, 
this is a representational precondition for simulating the other's 
behavior as goal-directed and intentional. Whether understand­
ing intentional action is, indeed, achieved first in relation to the 
self rather than the other is difficult to ascertain, however. This is 
because the behavioral evidence suggesting such understanding 
emerges more or less simultaneously—somewhere between the 
ages of 7 and 9 months—both in producing and interpreting goal-
directed intentional acts. Tomasello (1999) accounts for this 
simultaneity of emergence by proposing that as soon as means-
end differentiation is achieved in relation to the selfs own 
actions, it is immediately applied through simulation to under­
standing intentional actions of other agents as well. 
There is no developmental asynchrony that would indicate 
that understanding intentional action depends primarily on ac­
cessing self-states. The literature on the ability of adults to rely 
on internal information in making conscious agency judgments 
about perceived actions indicates a dominance of exteroceptive— 
for example, visual—information over internal cues (Jeannerod 
1997; Pacherie 1997). We know even less about the degree of 
introspective accessibility of internal correlates of intentional 
action in infancy, though again there is evidence from 6- and 9-
month-olds indicating the dominance of exteroceptive—visual— 
cues over proprioceptive—head orientation—cues in discrimina­
tive learning (Colombo et al. 1990). Gergely and Watson (1996, 
1999) have, therefore, argued that learning on the basis of 
exteroceptive stimuli may, in fact, have primacy in infancy, and 
sensitivity to internal cues correlated with differential emotional 
and intentional states may develop as a function of contingency 
detection and "social biofeedback" processes (see above). 
Such considerations, together with the apparent simultaneity 
of the emergence of understanding of intentional action in the

Such considerations, together with the apparent simultaneity

self and in others, are, therefore, compatible with the view that 
the development of self-knowledge does not enjoy primacy in the 
9-month revolution. In this vein, Gergely and Csibra's (1997) 
theory of the infant's teleological stance holds that the inferen­
tial principle of rational action brings about a qualitatively new 
level of understanding of goal-directed action simultaneously in 
the other and in the self. (See also Dennett 1987, and Gopnik 
1993, for arguments against the Cartesian notion of the primacy 
of "first-person authority" in.understanding agency.) 
3. The origins of mentalism. For Tomasello (1995, 1999) the 
9-month-old's intentional stance marks the first appearance 
of understanding that the actions of other agents—as well as of 
the self—are driven by causal mental states such as desires 
and intentions. Tomasello's evidence for-this claim is twofold: 
(a) He emphasizes the important fact that at least some of the 
joint-attention skills emerging between the ages of 9 and 15 
months (see Carpenter et al. 1998), such as protodeclarative 
gestures, seem to involve understanding—and influencing—an­
other agent's intentional mental state, such as her attention. 
(See also Leslie and Happe 1989.) (b) Tomasello's simulationist 
view implies that 9-month-olds start to represent the causal 
conditions of the other's goal-directed actions by making refer­
ence to their own internally experienced subjective mental states 
—attention, intention—through which they simulate the mental 
causes of the other's observable behavior. This is made possible 
by the hypothesized human-specific evolutionary adaptation to 
"identify" with the subjective perspective of other persons who 
are perceived as "just like me." For Tomasello, the coordinated 
emergence of the set of joint-attention skills at the end of the first 
year is underpinned by this propensity for mental simulation. 
In support of this view, Tomasello (1999) argues that the 
reason why primates do not seem to acquire joint-attention skills 
in their natural environment is not because they cannot achieve 
differentiated representations of means and goals in relation to 
their own actions. (They clearly do—see Tomasello and Call's 
excellent .1997 review on primate cognition.) Rather, what they 
are lacking is the human-specific biological adaptation to "iden-An Understanding of Self and Agency / 231 
tify" with the subjective perspective of other agents—that is, they 
lack the ability mentally to simulate: the subjective experience of 
others. 
In contrast, Gergely and Csibra (1997; Csibra and Gergely 1998) 
argue that the teleological stance mediating the 9-month-old's 
understanding of goal-directed rational action can be parsimoni­
ously modeled without attributing an ability to represent causal 
intentional mental states yet. In their view (see Csibra and 
Gergely 1998; Gergely and Csibra 2000) the requirements for a 
"purely" teleological interpretational system are less severe than 
are those for later theory of mind, because teleological under­
standing does not require representation of propositional atti­
tude states—such as beliefs and desires (Fodor 1992; Leslie 
1987, 1994) or comprehension of the representational nature 
of intentional mind states (Perner 1991). Thus, the teleological 
system is ontologically more restricted as its explanatory ele­
ments involve only the interpreter's own representations of— 
present and future—reality states, and it is computationally 
simpler as it does not involve the inference and attribution of 
intentional mental states to the other. It can also work without 
understanding the causal conditions of belief fixation (Leslie 
1995) such as the fact that perception leads to knowledge. These 
differences may, in fact, help to explain the remarkably early 
appearance of such interpretations by 9 months of age. 
Of course, nothing in Gergely and Csibra's habituation re­
sults directly necessitates this "lean" nonmentalistic interpreta­
tion. For example, Kelemen (1999) suggested that infants' early 
competence on such tasks may already reflect the attribution of 
mental states such as desires or intentions to the actors. How 
could one empirically differentiate between these views? 
Kelemen's mentalistic construal of teleological reasoning sug­
gests that the infant's understanding of teleological relations 
and that of intentional mind states are not independent but are 
aspects of the same underlying innate ability to attribute causal 
mental states to agents. This view predicts that the two types of 
ability must be either present or absent concurrently in any 
organism or species. Therefore, a dissociation between the abil-

self and in others, are, therefore, compatible with the view that 
the development of self-knowledge does not enjoy primacy in the 
9-month revolution. In this vein, Gergely and Csibra's (1997) 
theory of the infant's teleological stance holds that the inferen­
tial principle of rational action brings about a qualitatively new 
level of understanding of goal-directed action simultaneously in 
the other and in the self. (See also Dennett 1987, and Gopnik

and intentions. Tomasello's evidence for-this claim is twofold: 
(a) He emphasizes the important fact that at least some of the 
joint-attention skills emerging between the ages of 9 and 15 
months (see Carpenter et al. 1998), such as protodeclarative 
gestures, seem to involve understanding—and influencing—an­
other agent's intentional mental state, such as her attention. 
(See also Leslie and Happe 1989.) (b) Tomasello's simulationist 
view implies that 9-month-olds start to represent the causal 
conditions of the other's goal-directed actions by making refer­
ence to their own internally experienced subjective mental states 
—attention, intention—through which they simulate the mental 
causes of the other's observable behavior. This is made possible 
by the hypothesized human-specific evolutionary adaptation to 
"identify" with the subjective perspective of other persons who 
are perceived as "just like me." For Tomasello, the coordinated 
emergence of the set of joint-attention skills at the end of the first 
year is underpinned by this propensity for mental simulation. 
In support of this view, Tomasello (1999) argues that the 
reason why primates do not seem to acquire joint-attention skills 
in their natural environment is not because they cannot achieve 
differentiated representations of means and goals in relation to 
their own actions. (They clearly do—see Tomasello and Call's 
excellent .1997 review on primate cognition.) Rather, what they 
are lacking is the human-specific biological adaptation to "iden-An Understanding of Self and Agency / 231 
tify" with the subjective perspective of other agents—that is, they 
lack the ability mentally to simulate: the subjective experience of 
others. 
In contrast, Gergely and Csibra (1997; Csibra and Gergely 1998) 
argue that the teleological stance mediating the 9-month-old's 
understanding of goal-directed rational action can be parsimoni­
ously modeled without attributing an ability to represent causal 
intentional mental states yet. In their view (see Csibra and 
Gergely 1998; Gergely and Csibra 2000) the requirements for a 
"purely" teleological interpretational system are less severe than 
are those for later theory of mind, because teleological under­
standing does not require representation of propositional atti­
tude states—such as beliefs and desires (Fodor 1992; Leslie 
1987, 1994) or comprehension of the representational nature 
of intentional mind states (Perner 1991). Thus, the teleological 
system is ontologically more restricted as its explanatory ele­
ments involve only the interpreter's own representations of— 
present and future—reality states, and it is computationally 
simpler as it does not involve the inference and attribution of 
intentional mental states to the other. It can also work without 
understanding the causal conditions of belief fixation (Leslie 
1995) such as the fact that perception leads to knowledge. These 
differences may, in fact, help to explain the remarkably early 
appearance of such interpretations by 9 months of age. 
Of course, nothing in Gergely and Csibra's habituation re­
sults directly necessitates this "lean" nonmentalistic interpreta­
tion. For example, Kelemen (1999) suggested that infants' early 
competence on such tasks may already reflect the attribution of 
mental states such as desires or intentions to the actors. How 
could one empirically differentiate between these views? 
Kelemen's mentalistic construal of teleological reasoning sug­
gests that the infant's understanding of teleological relations 
and that of intentional mind states are not independent but are 
aspects of the same underlying innate ability to attribute causal 
mental states to agents. This view predicts that the two types of 
ability must be either present or absent concurrently in any 
organism or species. Therefore, a dissociation between the abil-

232 / Developmental Perspectives 
ity for teleological interpretation on the one hand and under­
standing causal intentional mind states on the other would 
represent potential counterevidence for this position. 
In contrast, the "independent teleology" position maintained 
by Gergely and Csibra (2000; Csibra and Gergely 1998) holds 
that the teleological stance is a biological adaptation that may 
have evolved independently from theory of mind to interpret and 
represent goal-directed and rational spatial behavior. The wide-
ranging presence of goal-directed organization of behavior 
among numerous species (including rats—see Tolman, Ritchie, 
and Kalish 1946) in the evolutionary environment may have 
exerted selective pressure for the evolution of a mechanism 
specialized for the discrimination and prediction of goal-directed 
action. In this view, the mentalistic "theory-of-mind" stance rep­
resents a further biological adaptation that leads to the ontologi-
cal enrichment of the teleological stance by including, apart from 
representations of—current and future—states of reality, the 
mental representations of fictional or counterfactual states as 
well in the form of mentally represented propositional attitude 
relations (Fodor 1992; Leslie 1987, 1994). 
Therefore, the teleological stance may be a useful interpreta-
tional strategy only in the—restricted—domain of intentional 
actions that are driven by causal mental states that represent 
aspects of actual reality truthfully. This is so because in such 
cases teleological interpretation of action can be based directly 
on reality without taking into consideration the actor's mental 
representations of that reality. The teleological stance would, 
however, break down in cases of intentional action where the 
actor's causal mind states represent fictional or counterfactual 
realities such as in pretense or false-belief-based action. This 
predicts the possibility of dissociation within an organism or a 
species that could exhibit an intact—reality-based—teleological 
reasoning capacity, while lacking a mentalistic understanding of 
intentional action. 
The clinical usefulness of the present propositions rests on 
the assumption that teleological thinking does not necessarily 
entail knowledge of the intentional stance or mentalization. In 
chapters 9-11 we review clinical evidence that is consistent with 
the assumption that some individuals with profound disorders of !*,••"-
An Understanding of Self and Agency / 233 
character are unable to make use of the intentional stance in 
attachment contexts but can and do think teleologically, to the 
great detriment of their social relations. 
Below we consider two types of dissociative2 evidence that 
seem to favor the "independent teleology" position (see Gergely 
and Csibra 2000). 
Dissociation 1: 
Intact Teleological Understanding, 
but Impaired Theory of Mind in Children with Autism 
Children with autism perform poorly in tests that require them 
to attribute intentional mind states—such as false beliefs—to 
others (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith 1985; Leslie and Thaiss 
1992). According to the "theory-of-mind deficit" account, child­
hood autism is a primary cognitive dysfunction, caused by 
a genetic defect of the innate "theory-of-mind" module that 
enables the representation of intentional mental states. There­
fore, if teleological interpretations always involve representing 
intentional mind states, children with autism should be equally 
impaired in tests that require teleological reasoning, like those 
used in the Csibra-Gergely type of infant habituation studies 
(Csibra et al. 1999; Gergely et al. 1995). In contrast, the "inde­
pendent teleology" position predicts that children with autism 
may have an intact reality-based "teleological stance" to 
interpret goal-directed actions, while, due to their pervasive 
metarepresentational deficit (Leslie 1994), they may be unable 
ontologically to enrich their teleology to form a "proper" theory of 
mind. 
For example, a study by Abell, Happe, and Frith (2001) pro­
vides evidence for this dissociation. Children with autism and 
matched controls were presented with three types of computer-
animated events involving abstract figures—such as triangles— 
to elicit verbal descriptions for these events. In their Random

standing causal intentional mind states on the other would 
represent potential counterevidence for this position. 
In contrast, the "independent teleology" position maintained

cases teleological interpretation of action can be based directly

Dissociation 1: 
Intact Teleological Understanding, 
but Impaired Theory of Mind in Children with Autism 
Children with autism perform poorly in tests that require them 
to attribute intentional mind states—such as false beliefs—to 
others (Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith 1985; Leslie and Thaiss 
1992). According to the "theory-of-mind deficit" account, child­
hood autism is a primary cognitive dysfunction, caused by

interpret goal-directed actions, while, due to their pervasive 
metarepresentational deficit (Leslie 1994), they may be unable 
ontologically to enrich their teleology to form a "proper" theory of 
mind. 
For example, a study by Abell, Happe, and Frith (2001) pro­
vides evidence for this dissociation. Children with autism and

animated events involving abstract figures—such as triangles— 
to elicit verbal descriptions for these events. In their Random

Animations condition the triangles did not interact but moved 
around purposelessly and independently of each other—floating 
in space; bouncing off the sides. Their Goal-directed sequences 
involved one of the triangles reacting to the other's behavior— 
such as, following, chasing, or fighting. In their Theory-of-mind 
sequences one character reacted to the other's mental state—for 
example, seducing, hiding and surprising, coaxing, or mocking. 
Normal adults predominantly used physicalist action descrip­
tions for the Random sequences, teleological interactive descrip­
tions for the Goal-directed events, and mentalistic descriptions 
for the Theory-of-mind sequences. Interestingly, while high-
functioning children with autism were not as good at providing 
accurate mentalistic descriptions for the Theory-of-mind se­
quences as were the matched controls, there was no difference in 
their ability to provide physicalist or teleological descriptions. 
Thus, their performance indicates a dissociation between their 
intact capacity to interpret goal-directed interactions teleologic-
ally, on the one hand, and their impaired theory of mind, on the 
other. 
Aldridge, Stone, Sweeney, and Bower (2000) have reported an 
intriguing replication in children with autism of Meltzoffs (1995) 
task in which 18-month-old normal infants were shown to infer 
and reenact the goal-directed action that an adult model in­
tended to perform after witnessing three failed attempts by the 
model to realize the intended act (see above). Aldridge and col­
leagues found that while children with autism were much worse 
than the controls at imitating adult gestures—such as tongue 
protrusion—that were not goal-directed, they nevertheless had 
no difficulties with reenacting the intended (but not actually 
observed) goal-directed actions implied by the model's failed 
attempts. Aldridge and coworkers argue that this finding demon­
strates that children with autism infer and attribute a mentally 
represented intention to the actor's mind—a result that they 
portray as paradoxical given the theory-of-mind deficit account 
of childhood autism. Meltzoff offered a more cautious view, sug­
gesting that his 18-month-old "infants may think that human 
acts have goals without yet ascribing underlying mental states in 
the mind" (1995, p. 848). This, in fact, corresponds precisely to 
the assumptions of the teleological stance (Gergely and Csibra i. 
r An Understanding of Self and Agency / 235 
1997). The Aldridge et al. demonstration can therefore be seen as 
further evidence for the proposition that autistic children's abil­
ity to interpret actions as goal-directed—which does not neces­
sarily require assumptions about others' states of mind—is not 
affected by their lack of capacity to infer intentional mental 
states in others. 
Dissociation 2: 
Differential Emergence of Teleologically— 
but not Mentalistic ally—Based Joint-Attention Skills 
in Apes as a Function of Human Enculturation 
As we have seen, Tomasello (1999) argues that nonhuman 
primates lack the human-specific evolutionary adaptation to 
"identify" with the internal experience of others who behave "just 
like them." As a result, even though they achieve means-end 
coordination of their own goal-directed actions in a way similar 
to 9-month-old humans, they nevertheless cannot use these 
self-representations to simulate the causal intentional mind 
states that drive the goal-directed actions of other agents. This 
inability to take the intentional stance may explain why non-
human primates do not normally develop the series of communi­
cative joint-attention skills that emerge in human infants 
between the ages of 9 and 15 months (Carpenter et al. 1998), 
which are thought to depend on the ability to take the inten­
tional stance. 
In his review on the effects of human enculturation on apes, 
Tomasello (1999; Call and Tomasello 1996) takes a position that 
is partly at odds with this theoretical view. He reports that two 
"joint-attention skills" do emerge in chimpanzees who have been 
raised by humans. These skills are protoimperative pointing at 
objects in order to get them and acquiring novel object-directed 
actions through imitative learning. However, chimpanzees who 
have been brought up by humans do not seem to acquire the 
other skills in the set of joint-attention behaviors—such as proto-
declarative gestures or intentional teaching. But if, as Tomasello 
hypothesizes, the human-specific innate capacity to simulate the 
other's intentional states through "identification" is, indeed, a

prerequisite for all of these joint-attention skills, then how is it 
that apes that are raised by humans can develop even this 
partial understanding of intentionality? 
If we accept the view that nonhuman primates lack the innate 
capacity to represent intentional mind states but nevertheless 
can adopt the nonmentalistic teleological stance to interpret 
goal-directed actions, it becomes possible to explain why chim­
panzees brought up by humans develop this particular subset 
—that is, protoimperatives and imitative learning—of the "joint-
attention skills." The crucial difference between these skills and, 
say, protodeclarative communication or intentional teaching is 
that they consist of goal-directed activities whose goals involve 
visible changes of external reality. In contrast, a protodeclarative 
communication aims to induce or modify a nonvisible intentional 
mind state of the other. Significantly, children with autism are 
also able to produce and understand protoimperative pointing 
gestures that are goal-directed acts that can be •teleologically 
interpreted, but they fail to understand or produce protodeclara­
tive pointing, which requires a mentalistic construal of goals (see 
Baron-Cohen 1991). 
The nonmentalistic teleological interpretational system com­
mon to both humans and apes enables apes to parse and repre­
sent protoimperative communicative acts or new instrumental 
actions modeled to them in imitative learning situations in terms 
of their visible outcomes—as goals-of-action—differentiated 
from the means that bring those goal states about. In addition, 
an upbringing by humans can teach them—through modeling, 
shaping, selective rewarding, and so on—specifically to attend to 
and imitatively produce the particular means modeled, and so to 
overcome their naturally dominant tendency to selectively attend 
to the salient outcome state only—as evidenced in emulation. 
However, enculturation cannot teach them to represent goals-of-
action that are nonvisible and mental such as inducing, sharing, 
or modifying an intentional mind state of the other—because 
they lack the theory-of-mind capacity to represent intentional 
mental'states. 
To conclude—we have reviewed two types of dissociative evi­
dence in support of the view that the nonmentalistic teleological An Understanding of Self and Agency / 237 
stance may have evolved independently of the human-specific 
ability to represent and attribute intentional mind states such as 
intentions to others. This teleological interpretational system 
can parsimoniously account for the 9-month social-cognitive 
revolution in human infants that involves the emergence of 
qualitatively new abilities to produce goal-directed rational ac­
tions and to interpret such actions in others. There is evidence 
to suggest that the teleological stance is present not only in 
normal human infants by 9 months of age, but also in non-
human primates and in children with autism. Both of the latter 
seem, however, to lack the mentalistic intentional stance, which 
is likely to be an additional human-specific adaptation that has 
evolved to enable us to understand and communicate with other 
minds. 
UNDERSTANDING THE SELF AND OTHER 
AS "INTENTIONAL MENTAL AGENTS" 
The next qualitative step in human development is the emerging 
ability to attribute "prior intentions" (Searle 1983) to the other 
and the self to explain or predict future goalTdirected actions. By 
2 years of age infants show the first signs of understanding that 
the other can have a prior intention or desire before or without 
actually acting on it and can attribute such prior intentions to 
others from evidence other than observing the goal-directed 
action itself. This clearly implies the capacity to represent in­
tentional mental states (mentalism), and the ability to predict 
goal-directed action from inferred prior intentions implies the 
capacity to think in terms of mental causation. 
Evidence for the appearance of such a mentalistic under­
standing of causal intentions by the second year comes from 
a number of sources. (For a recent review, see Wellman and 
Phillips 2000.) For example, Bartsch and Wellman (1995) dem­
onstrated that 2-year-olds spontaneously use verbal references 
to their own or another person's specific desires—using mostly 
the word "want"—even when the desire-based action has not yet

prerequisite for all of these joint-attention skills, then how is it 
that apes that are raised by humans can develop even this 
partial understanding of intentionality? 
If we accept the view that nonhuman primates lack the innate 
capacity to represent intentional mind states but nevertheless 
can adopt the nonmentalistic teleological stance to interpret 
goal-directed actions, it becomes possible to explain why chim­
panzees brought up by humans develop this particular subset

also able to produce and understand protoimperative pointing 
gestures that are goal-directed acts that can be •teleologically 
interpreted, but they fail to understand or produce protodeclara­

to suggest that the teleological stance is present not only in 
normal human infants by 9 months of age, but also in non-
human primates and in children with autism. Both of the latter 
seem, however, to lack the mentalistic intentional stance, which 
is likely to be an additional human-specific adaptation that has 
evolved to enable us to understand and communicate with other 
minds. 
UNDERSTANDING THE SELF AND OTHER 
AS "INTENTIONAL MENTAL AGENTS" 
The next qualitative step in human development is the emerging 
ability to attribute "prior intentions" (Searle 1983) to the other 
and the self to explain or predict future goalTdirected actions. By 
2 years of age infants show the first signs of understanding that 
the other can have a prior intention or desire before or without 
actually acting on it and can attribute such prior intentions to 
others from evidence other than observing the goal-directed 
action itself. This clearly implies the capacity to represent in­
tentional mental states (mentalism), and the ability to predict 
goal-directed action from inferred prior intentions implies the 
capacity to think in terms of mental causation. 
Evidence for the appearance of such a mentalistic under­
standing of causal intentions by the second year comes from 
a number of sources. (For a recent review, see Wellman and 
Phillips 2000.) For example, Bartsch and Wellman (1995) dem­
onstrated that 2-year-olds spontaneously use verbal references 
to their own or another person's specific desires—using mostly 
the word "want"—even when the desire-based action has not yet 

238 / Developmental Perspectives 
been performed or when the action executed did not fulfill the 
attributed desire. Verbal references to desires or intentions at 
this age also clearly demonstrate that 2-year-olds can differenti­
ate between their own and other people's subjective desire 
states. Repacholi and Gopnik (1997) demonstrated that when 
18-month-olds were asked to give the experimenter something to 
eat, they provided her with the particular food item—broccoli vs. 
goldfish crackers—that she had previously expressed a liking 
for—by saying "yuck" or "yummy" when first facing the food 
item. Thus, they modulated their own goal-directed action—to 
give food to the experimenter—by considering the specific con­
tent of the desire they had attributed to the other previously, 
based on an earlier and different action, even when that desire 
was different from their own preference. In contrast, 14-month-
olds gave the experimenter the item they themselves liked, bas­
ing their choice on their own preference without being able to 
consider the other's relevant prior intention. 
Mature empathic reactions of concern leading to pro-social 
acts also appear during the second year (Hoffman 2000; R. 
Thompson 1998; Zahn-Waxler and Radke-Yarrow 1990). Infants 
of this age can attribute a subjective emotion state to the other 
and differentiate this state from their own felt emotion as shown 
by the capacity to devise a goal-directed pro-social act aimed at 
modifying the emotion state of the other. 
From the age of 2 years on, young children also start to show 
some sensitivity to the causal connections that exist between 
different types of intentional mental states. For example, they 
can infer that a desire that is unfulfilled by a given action triggers 
sadness or frustration rather than joy and will generate further 
alternative goal-directed action. (See Wellman and Phillips 2000.) 
Such demonstrations, therefore, clearly imply that by 2 years 
of age infants possess a rudimentary concept of desire as an 
intentional mental state that represents—is "about"—a hypo­
thetical state of the world—the goal state—that has the power 
to cause instrumental action and that has causal connections 
to other types of mental states. This representational system 
amounts to a "naive theory of mind" (Fodor 1992; Leslie 1987, 
1994; Leslie and Keeble 1987), which holds that goal-directed An Understanding of Self and Agency / 239 
actions are caused by intentional mental states that represent 
states of affairs in the world and that are systematically con­
nected to each other causally. 
The ability to represent agents in terms of relatively enduring 
causal intentional mental states that can be divorced from par­
ticular goal-directed actions also establishes new conditions for 
how children will predict and interpret behavior. As a result of 
repeated experiences with similar types of goal-directed actions 
of significant others—such as caregivers or siblings—in compa­
rable situations, children will begin to attribute generalized in­
tentions or attitudes to them: these become stable characteristics 
of their representations of these others. Such generalized and 
enduring intentional properties of particular persons will come 
to function as further constraining factors, in addition to situa­
tional and dispositional constraints, when the principle of ra­
tional action is applied to predict or interpret their behavior. At 
this point, a new principle of reasoning of naive theory of mind, 
which we can call the "principle of mental coherence" (cf. Den­
nett 1987), comes into play: this is the assumption that a 
rational agent's causal intentions are not contradictory. The 
child has to be able to make this assumption if he is to produce 
well-formed action predictions: if an agent's intentions involve 
contradictory goals, it is impossible to infer a rational course 
of action. In developmental psychopathology parents whose be­
havior toward their children is abusive and dissociative provide 
inferential grounds to attribute contradictory generalized inten­
tions to them. In cases where this happens, it has been hypoth­
esized that this will lead to a dysfunctional theory of mind and 
consequent pathological patterns of self-development involving 
disorganization and splitting (see Fonagy, Target, and Gergely 
2000; Gergely 2000; Gergely, Koos, and Watson, in press). The 
developmental distortions of the capacity to attribute general­
ized intentions or attitudes are manifest in a range of clinical 
features of borderline disorder, particularly in the predominance 
of split representations of self and others (see chapter 9) and 
the common failure to represent the distinction between exter­
nal reality and internal representations of that reality (see chap­
ter 10).

been performed or when the action executed did not fulfill the 
attributed desire. Verbal references to desires or intentions at 
this age also clearly demonstrate that 2-year-olds can differenti­
ate between their own and other people's subjective desire 
states. Repacholi and Gopnik (1997) demonstrated that when 
18-month-olds were asked to give the experimenter something to 
eat, they provided her with the particular food item—broccoli vs. 
goldfish crackers—that she had previously expressed a liking 
for—by saying "yuck" or "yummy" when first facing the food 
item. Thus, they modulated their own goal-directed action—to 
give food to the experimenter—by considering the specific con­
tent of the desire they had attributed to the other previously, 
based on an earlier and different action, even when that desire 
was different from their own preference. In contrast, 14-month-
olds gave the experimenter the item they themselves liked, bas­
ing their choice on their own preference without being able to 
consider the other's relevant prior intention. 
Mature empathic reactions of concern leading to pro-social 
acts also appear during the second year (Hoffman 2000; R. 
Thompson 1998; Zahn-Waxler and Radke-Yarrow 1990). Infants 
of this age can attribute a subjective emotion state to the other 
and differentiate this state from their own felt emotion as shown 
by the capacity to devise a goal-directed pro-social act aimed at 
modifying the emotion state of the other. 
From the age of 2 years on, young children also start to show 
some sensitivity to the causal connections that exist between 
different types of intentional mental states. For example, they 
can infer that a desire that is unfulfilled by a given action triggers 
sadness or frustration rather than joy and will generate further 
alternative goal-directed action. (See Wellman and Phillips 2000.)

240 / Developmental Perspectives 
Development of the Self-Concept during the Second Year 
The ability of the 2-year-old to adopt this mentalistic intentional 
stance, representing agents in terms of generalized and enduring 
intentional properties, also brings about a new level of self-
understanding. As Tomasello (1993, 1999) argues (in keeping 
with the long tradition of social constructivism in self-develop­
ment—see, e.g., Baldwin 1902; Cooley 1912; Fonagy and Target 
1997; Mead 1934), the intentional actions and attitudes repeat­
edly expressed toward the young child by caregivers and peers 
lead the child to infer and attribute generalized intentional prop­
erties to himself in an attempt to rationalize his social partners' 
behavior. This is how the establishment of a "categorical" self-
concept or representation—the Jamesian "Me"—originates (Har­
ter 1999; Lewis and Brooks-Gunn 1979). Apart from the directly 
perceivable features of the "empirical" self, this self-representa­
tion includes generalized intentional properties that are socially 
inferred. For example, in developmental psychopathology unreal-
istically negative self-attributions are seen to arise from the 
child's attempts to rationalize the abusive or seriously neglectful 
treatment that he has received from attachment figures (Allen 
1995, 2001; Cicchetti and Toth 1994; Fonagy and Target 1997; 
Fonagy, Target, and Gergely 2000). The case of "Emma" (chapter 
10) may be a helpful illustration. Cared for by a suicidal mother 
with bipolar disorder and a paranoid psychotic father, she inter­
nalized a picture of herself as mad and unpredictable and could 
behave accordingly. These internalizations into the self-structure 
were, however, distinct and separate from her representation of 
herself as a competent and helpful person who could sort out the 
problems of others with their difficulties in thinking and feeling. 
Clinically, the challenge is that the mad and sometimes abusive 
caregiving figure is internalized into the same representational 
system as the representation of the constitutional self, and thus 
both are felt to be parts of the Jamesian "Me." 
The developmental origins of the cognitive concept or repre­
sentation of the self as an objective entity with enduring proper­
ties has also been tied to the end of the second year by the 
results of extended research on early self-recognition in the mirror 
(Amsterdam 1972; Gallup 1991; Gallup and Suarez 1986; Lewis 
it An Understanding of Self and Agency / 241 
and Brooks-Gunn 1979; Parker, Mitchell, and Boccia 1994). The 
fact that between 18 and 24 months of age—but not before— 
infants can recognize in the mirror an inadvertently placed rouge 
mark on their nose or forehead as belonging to themselves (as 
shown by the fact that they attempt to remove it from their own 
body rather than from the mirror image) indicates that, based on 
previous experience with their mirror image, infants have in­
ferred and attributed to their self-representation the directly not 
perceivable visual features of their faces. The implications of this 
finding for the representational nature of the self-concept at this 
age, however, have been a subject of controversy (see Parker et 
al. 1994). While for some (e.g., Bertenthal and Fisher 1978; 
Menzel, Savage-Rumbaugh, and Lawson 1985) mirror self-recog­
nition can be accounted for in terms of increased perceptuo-
motor skills, at the other extreme Gallup and his followers (e.g., 
Gallup and Suarez 1986) argue that this capacity implies self-
awareness and the achievement of a representational self-con­
cept that is inherently linked to understanding intentional mind 
states of others. This strong mentalistic interpretation of mirror 
self-recognition has, however, been challenged by numerous 
researchers on a number of grounds (e.g., Gergely 1994; R. W. 
Mitchell 1993; Povinelli 1995; Povinelli and Simon 1998)—for 
example, by observing the fact that mirror self-recognition is 
present in chimpanzees (Gallup 1970) as well as in children with 
autism (Dawson and McKissick 1984), both of whom seem to 
lack a theory of mind (Baron-Cohen et al. 1985; Call and Toma­
sello 1999). 
Howe and Courage (1993, 1997) have argued that the appear­
ance of the cognitive self-concept at 2 years of age, as evidenced 
by mirror self-recognition, is a precondition for—and marks the 
lower bound of—autobiographical memory for personally experi­
enced events. In their view, the well-known phenomenon of 
infantile amnesia can be attributed to the lack of a cognitive self-
concept before 2 years of age. They propose that the organiza­
tion of personal event memories into an integrated and coherent 
memory structure that allows for later autobiographical recall is 
made possible by the establishment of the cognitive concept of 
the self as a representation of an objective entity with temporal 
and causal continuity. This provides a common conceptual

we review some intriguing new findings about the development 
of the self-concept, which suggest that mirror self-recognition 
may indicate only a limited understanding of the self that is tied 
to the present (the "present self—see Povinelli 1995). The con­
struction of a temporally "extended self" underlying autobio­
graphical memory in which past events experienced by the self 
are causally integrated with the present self into a unified self-
concept (the "proper self—see W. James, 1890) seems to require 
some further developments in representational capacities: it ap­
pears to be achieved only at around 4 to 5 years of age. 
UNDERSTANDING SELF AND OTHER 
AS "REPRESENTATIONAL AGENTS" 
AND THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE "AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SELF" 
A mature understanding of mental agency—that is, naive theory 
of mind—involves a number of factors (see Fodor 1992; Leslie 
1987), including the ability to attribute and represent different 
types of intentional mind states (such as desires and beliefs), 
understanding how they are causally related, comprehending 
the representational nature of such mental states (Perner 1991), 
and knowing both that they have causal potential" to generate 
action and that they themselves are caused by perceptual expe­
riences, verbal testimony, or inference (i.e., their properties of 
"causal self-referentiality"—Campbell 1997; Perner 2000a; 
Searle 1983). The reasons for the fact that these different aspects 
of knowledge about the mind surface at different ages in young 
children have been the subject of heated controversy and theo­
rizing for the last twenty years or so (e.g., Astington et al. 1988; 
Baron-Cohen, Tager-Flusberg, and Cohen 2000; Carruthers 
1996; Davis and Stone 1995; Lewis and Mitchell 1994; Whiten 
1991). Three major positions, outlined in brief already in chapter 
1, have been identified concerning the nature of the underlying An Understanding of Self and Agency / 243 
cognitive mechanisms that lead to the development of mature 
theory of mind by about 4 years of age. These are (a) the innate 
modularist approach (Fodor 1992; Leslie 1987, 1995), (b) the 
simulationist view (Gordon 1995; P. L. Harris 1991, 1992), and 
(c) the theory-theory position (Gopnik and Wellman 1992, 1994; 
Perner 1991). In chapter 1 we contrasted these formulations 
from the standpoint of the account they might give of the integra­
tion of attachment processes with the development of theory of 
mind. Here we shall not attempt to review and evaluate the 
relative merits of these theories. Rather, we shall simply concen­
trate on characterizing some of the qualitatively novel aspects of 
understanding self and other as representational agents that 
seem to arise between 3 and 4 years of age. 
One of the central issues is the question of why it is that, 
while a mentalistic understanding of desires seems to be present 
by 2 years of age, the representational understanding of belief, 
as diagnosed by the ability to comprehend false-belief-based 
actions, is delayed until 3 to 4 years of age. Wimmer and Perner 
(1983) were the first to demonstrate that 3-year-olds who wit­
ness a person leaving an object in container A before leaving 
the room and who see the object being transferred to container B 
in that person's absence make the—reality-based—error of 
predicting that she will search in container B—where the object 
actually is—rather than in container A—where she left the ob­
ject—when she comes back. By the age of 4 or 5, children no 
longer commit this error: they tend to predict correctly that the 
person will look in container A, because they are able to at­
tribute a false belief to her. 
A number of theoretical positions have been put forward to 
explain this late occurrence of understanding false beliefs. Mod-
ularists like Leslie (1987, 1994) and Fodor (1992) argue that the 
metarepresentational system necessary to represent proposi-
tional attitude concepts such as desire, pretense, or belief is fully 
in place by the end of the second year (as evidenced by the 
capacity to produce and understand pretend play—see Leslie 
1987). In Leslie's view, attributing false beliefs is delayed because 
of performance limitations in attending to and learning about the 
causal conditions of belief fixation—for example, that perception 
leads to knowledge (see Leslie and Roth 1993). In contrast,

244 / Developmental Perspectives 
Perner and others (e.g., Gopnik and Wellman 1992, 1994; Perner 
1991, 2000b) argue that before 4 years of age children do not yet 
understand intentional'mind states "as representations": that is, 
as mental states that are "about" some—real or hypothetical— 
state of affairs and that can be evaluated as true or false in 
relation to such a state of affairs (Perner 2000b). Perner also 
argues that understanding beliefs "as representations" is also a 
necessary requirement for understanding that actions are men­
tally caused by representations of reality rather than by reality 
itself. 
One kind of—newly emerging—evidence on which Perner and 
others (see Mitchell and Riggs 2000; Perner and Lang 1999) rely 
in arguing that understanding intentional states as mental rep­
resentations with causal power over behavior is arrived at only 
around 3 to 5 years of age comes from intriguing correlations 
that have been discovered between understanding false-belief-
based action (theory of mind) on the one hand and showing 
mature self-control abilities in executive function tasks and 
mastery of counterfactual reasoning tasks on the other. To ex­
plain the correlated dramatic improvement in these rather differ­
ent task domains at around 4 years of age, Perner. (2000a) 
argues that they all require an understanding of the fact that the 
intentional mental states they involve have the property of 
"causal self-referentiality"—a notion taken over from philosophy 
of mind (see Campbell 1997; Searle 1983). Briefly, this notion 
suggests that to understand a mental intentional state properly, 
say, an intention to act, we must be aware not only that the 
intention represents some state of affairs, but also that it speci­
fies—represents in its content—that the intended action be 
caused by the intention to act (Perner 2000b, p. 300). (This 
forms the representational basis for our awareness or sense of 
agency as well as ownership of action.) Similarly, in order to be 
recalled as an item in autobiographical memory, the memory 
representation of a specific event that a person has experienced 
must not only specify the event itself but must also represent the 
fact that the memory has been caused by that event (memory for 
causal source of knowledge). 
Perner (2000b) reviews evidence from theory-of-mind re­
search indicating that children before 4 to 5 years of age are 
it An Understanding of Self and Agency / 245 
notoriously bad at identifying the causal sources of their beliefs 
(such as whether they have seen, "were told about, or inferred 
what is in a box—see, e.g., Gopnik and Graf 1988; Wimmer, 
Hogrefe, and Perner 1988; Wimmer, Hogrefe, and Sodian 1988). 
Executive function tasks, such as the Wisconsin card sorting 
task, in which failure in 3-year-olds and in children with autism 
(see Hughes and Russell 1993; J. Russell 1996) correlates with 
failure on theory-of-mind tasks, involve the need to inhibit a 
natural response tendency in favor of an adaptive response. It is 
suggested (see Pacherie 1997; Perner 2000b; J. Russell 1996, 
1997) that self-awareness of the causal power of the mental 
disposition that results in the natural response is a necessary 
prerequisite before this natural response can be inhibited. It has 
also been hypothesized that difficulties in self-monitoring of 
intentions underlie the co-occurrence of self-control difficul­
ties—and mistaken attributions of one's own intentional con­
tents to external sources—and theory-of-mind problems in 
schizophrenia (C. D. Frith 1992) on the one hand, and the co­
occurrence of executive function problems and theory-of-mind 
difficulties in children with autism on the other (Carruthers and 
Smith 1996; Pacherie 1997; J. Russell 1996, 1997). 
The Emergence of the Autobiographical Self 
Perner also argues that infantile amnesia (the lack of genuine 
memories of personally experienced events that occurred prior to 
about 3 to 4 years of age—see K, Nelson 1992, 1993; Perner 
1990, 1991) is due to young children's inability to "encode per­
sonally experienced events as-personally experienced' (Perner 
2000b, p. 306)—that is, in terms of their causal informational 
source "as having been seen." At around 4 to 5 years of age, as 
the ability to represent the informational source as well as 
the content of knowledge emerges in theory-of-mind tasks, the 
autobiographic organization of memories as personally experi­
enced events is also established. 
An ingenious recent series of studies by Povinelli and his 
colleagues has confirmed that children below 4 to 5 years of age 
find it extremely difficult to integrate self-related experiences 

244 / Developmental Perspectives 
Perner and others (e.g., Gopnik and Wellman 1992, 1994; Perner 
1991, 2000b) argue that before 4 years of age children do not yet 
understand intentional'mind states "as representations": that is, 
as mental states that are "about" some—real or hypothetical— 
state of affairs and that can be evaluated as true or false in 
relation to such a state of affairs (Perner 2000b). Perner also 
argues that understanding beliefs "as representations" is also a 
necessary requirement for understanding that actions are men­
tally caused by representations of reality rather than by reality 
itself. 
One kind of—newly emerging—evidence on which Perner and 
others (see Mitchell and Riggs 2000; Perner and Lang 1999) rely 
in arguing that understanding intentional states as mental rep­
resentations with causal power over behavior is arrived at only 
around 3 to 5 years of age comes from intriguing correlations 
that have been discovered between understanding false-belief-
based action (theory of mind) on the one hand and showing 
mature self-control abilities in executive function tasks and 
mastery of counterfactual reasoning tasks on the other. To ex­
plain the correlated dramatic improvement in these rather differ­
ent task domains at around 4 years of age, Perner. (2000a) 
argues that they all require an understanding of the fact that the 
intentional mental states they involve have the property of 
"causal self-referentiality"—a notion taken over from philosophy 
of mind (see Campbell 1997; Searle 1983). Briefly, this notion 
suggests that to understand a mental intentional state properly, 
say, an intention to act, we must be aware not only that the 
intention represents some state of affairs, but also that it speci­
fies—represents in its content—that the intended action be 
caused by the intention to act (Perner 2000b, p. 300). (This 
forms the representational basis for our awareness or sense of 
agency as well as ownership of action.) Similarly, in order to be 
recalled as an item in autobiographical memory, the memory 
representation of a specific event that a person has experienced 
must not only specify the event itself but must also represent the 
fact that the memory has been caused by that event (memory for 
causal source of knowledge). 
Perner (2000b) reviews evidence from theory-of-mind re­
search indicating that children before 4 to 5 years of age are 
it An Understanding of Self and Agency / 245 
notoriously bad at identifying the causal sources of their beliefs 
(such as whether they have seen, "were told about, or inferred 
what is in a box—see, e.g., Gopnik and Graf 1988; Wimmer, 
Hogrefe, and Perner 1988; Wimmer, Hogrefe, and Sodian 1988). 
Executive function tasks, such as the Wisconsin card sorting 
task, in which failure in 3-year-olds and in children with autism 
(see Hughes and Russell 1993; J. Russell 1996) correlates with 
failure on theory-of-mind tasks, involve the need to inhibit a 
natural response tendency in favor of an adaptive response. It is 
suggested (see Pacherie 1997; Perner 2000b; J. Russell 1996, 
1997) that self-awareness of the causal power of the mental 
disposition that results in the natural response is a necessary 
prerequisite before this natural response can be inhibited. It has 
also been hypothesized that difficulties in self-monitoring of 
intentions underlie the co-occurrence of self-control difficul­
ties—and mistaken attributions of one's own intentional con­
tents to external sources—and theory-of-mind problems in 
schizophrenia (C. D. Frith 1992) on the one hand, and the co­
occurrence of executive function problems and theory-of-mind 
difficulties in children with autism on the other (Carruthers and

into a coherent causal-temporal organization around a self-
concept extended in time (Povinelli and Eddy 1995; Povinelli, 
Landau, and Perilloux 1996; Povinelli, Landry, Theall, Clark, and 
Castille 1999; Povinelli and Simon 1998). The previously widely 
held belief that mirror self-recognition by 2 years of age signals 
the construction of a stable cognitive concept of the self (see 
Gallup and Suarez 1986; Howe and Courage 1993; Lewis and 
Brooks-Gunn 1979) has been challenged by Povinelli's demon­
strations that recognition of the self on a briefly delayed video 
feedback is absent before 4 to 5 years of age. In one study 
(Povinelli and Simon 1998) children were videotaped while play­
ing a game with an experimenter who covertly placed a large 
sticker on the child's head during the game. Three minutes later, 
when the videotape was played back to the children, 3-year-olds 
failed to reach up to remove the sticker (visible on the videotape) 
from their head, even though they generally managed to "recog­
nize" their video image as themselves verbally by saying "it's me" 
or their proper name when asked who the child was on the video. 
(However, when asked where the sticker was, they tended to 
reply that "it's on his head" instead of their own!) They neverthe­
less did reach up to remove the sticker when presented with a 
mirror. In contrast, 4- to 5-year-olds could relate the delayed 
video feedback to their current self: they removed the sticker 
when presented with the videotape. 
Perner explains this finding by arguing that "3-year-olds seem 
to lack an understanding of the causal link between recorded 
events and what they see on the video record" (2000b, p. 302). 
However, in a series of control studies Povinelli et al. (1999) 
demonstrated that 3-year-olds do understand the equivalence 
between delayed video images and the real world, as they are 
able to witness an object being hidden on video and then suc­
cessfully locate it. In Povinelli's theory (Povinelli and Eddy 1995; 
Povinelli and Simon 1998; Povinelli et al. 1999) the concept of an 
"autobiographical self emerges at around 4 years as a function 
of changes in the child's representational capacities. First, at the 
end of the second year infants develop the ability to hold a single 
representation or model of the world in mind (see also Olson and 
Campbell 1993; Perner 1991), which they can compare to pres-An Understanding of Self and Agency / 247 
ently perceived aspects of reality. This underlies the ability to 
recognize the self in the mirror between 18 and 24 months: the 
single mental representation of the selfs actions and physical 
features—the "present self—is compared to the mirror image 
with which an equivalence relation is assumed. At around 4 
years, however, "children become able to hold in mind multiple 
representations or models of the world simultaneously" (Povinelli 
and Simon 1998, p. 189). This enables them to establish tempo­
ral and causal relations among memories of previously encoded 
experiences of the self and, in particular, to causally "evaluate 
the relevance of previous states of the self to the present self (p. 
189). Thus, 4- to 5-year-olds can draw a causal inference that if a 
few minutes ago a sticker was placed on their head (as revealed 
by the videotape), their present state is likely to be affected by 
this past event, so that the sticker is probably still on their head. 
The ability to relate multiple representations underlies, there­
fore, the establishment of an abstract historical-causal self-
concept (the "autobiographical stance"), which integrates memo­
ries of previously unrelated states of the self into an organized, 
coherent, and unified autobiographical self-representation. The 
therapeutic implications of the profound restriction on individu­
als with severe self-pathology to manipulate multiple representa­
tions of the self are taken up again in chapter 10. 
IMPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL 
PSYCHOPATHOLOGY 
In this chapter we have traced the complex and intricate devel­
opment of the young child's emerging understanding of the self 
and others as agents in the environment starting from birth to 
about 5 years of age. Our discussion focused on the ways in 
which the young child develops a representational understand­
ing of the causal relations—both physical and mental—between 
persons and their actions and between actions and consequent 
changes in the environment. We found it useful to distinguish 
among five different levels of the development of understanding

which the young child develops a representational understand­

among five different levels of the development of understanding 
agency and selfhood: 

"^j w~*~' 
248 / Developmental Perspectives 
1. the self as a "physical agent," which involves the differenti­
ated representation of the body as a separate and dynamic 
entity that can cause physical changes in the environment; 
2. the self as a "social agent," which represents the species-
specific affective-communicative interactions—as well as 
their subjective emotional-intentional correlates—in which 
infants and caregivers engage from birth on; 
3. the self as a "teleological agent," which refers to the qualita­
tively new but still nonmentalistic understanding of goal-
directed rational action emerging at around 9 months of age 
and underlying the so-called "9-month social-cognitive revo­
lution"; 
4. the self as an "intentional mental agent," which emerges dur­
ing the second year and involves an already mentalistic un­
derstanding of some causal intentional mind states such as 
desires and-intentions that are represented as existing prior 
to and separately from the actions they generate; 
5. the self as a "representational agent" and the emergence of the 
"autobiographical self around 4 to 5 years of age, which 
involves the ability to comprehend the "representational" and 
"causally self-referential" properties of intentional mind 
states, leading, among other things, to the establishment of 
an abstract, temporally extended, historical-causal concept of 
the "autobiographical self." 
Contingency detection may have a key role to play in several 
forms of psychopathology that involve the malformation of the 
self as agent. We envision a spectrum of disturbances all in­
volving abnormal sensitivities to contingencies. At one extreme 
might be cases where, for primarily biological reasons, a lack of 
sensitivity to anything other than perfect contingencies might 
entirely undermine the possibility of social development. Watson 
has hypothesized (Gergely 2001b; Gergely et al. in press; Gergely 
and Watson 1999; Watson 1994) that the etiology of childhood 
autism may be related to a genetically based malfunctioning of 
the "switching mechanism" of the contingency-detection mod­
ule. According to this hypothesis, in autistic individuals the 
contingency analyzer gets "stuck" forever in its original setting of

preferentially seeking out and processing perfectly self-contin­
gent stimuli. As a result, children with autism continue to invest 
in perfect contingencies—generated by stereotypic self-stimula­
tion or repetitive object-manipulation—throughout their lives, 
while showing a lack of interest in the less-than-perfect con­
tingencies provided' by their social environment. (See Gergely 
2001b; for some preliminary supporting evidence, see Gergely, 
Magyar, and Balazs 1999; Gergely and Watson 1999, pp. 125-
130.) From such a primary deficit in contingency detection one 
can derive a range of the focal symptoms associated with child­
hood autism, such as the preponderance of behavioral stereo­
typies and rhythmicities, intolerance to variation in routines, 
difficulties in inhibiting prepotent or habitual responses involved 
in executive function deficits, aversion to social objects, and 
even the lack of sensitivity to the social cues that drive mind-
reading skills. (For details, see Gergely 2001b; Gergely and 
Watson 1999.) 
Throughout this volume we suggest that in less severe cases, 
attachment environments that involve dysfunctional patterns of 
contingencies between actions of the self and the response of the 
other may lead to a distorted functioning of contingency detec­
tion. This, in turn, might undermine the normal development of 
self-agency by depriving the individual of some key building 
blocks for the development of this structure. As we have indi­
cated above, inadequacies of the structuralization of the self 
might arise out of a biologically determined predisposition to fail 
to engage less-than-perfect social contingencies in an interper­
sonal context. Alternatively, the normal development of the self 
may become undermined as a result of the caregiver's inad­
equate provision of adaptive contingent responsiveness. For ex­
ample, abusive caregivers or preoccupied, dissociating caregivers 
who are unresolved in relation to trauma periodically show a 
severe reduction of contingent responsivity—during abusive epi­
sodes or periods of parental dissociation. During such recurring 
episodes, the child repeatedly experiences periods of drastic loss 
in the contingent effectivity of his affective and communicative 
responses (Koos and Gergely 2001). 
This may lead to disorganization in self-development charac­

pation with self-generated perfect contingencies in the attach­
ment context. In support of this view, we have preliminary 
evidence indicating an early association between disorganized 
infant attachment and an abnormal preference for perfect con­
tingencies (Koos and Gergely 2001; Koos et al. 2000). 
In our view, then, both the maladaptive features of the care­
giver's contingent responsiveness and the infant's inadequate 
sensitivity to social contingencies may determine the establish­
ment of an abnormal focus on perfect contingencies and a 
pathological development of self-agency. In either case, the most 
pertinent observation is one of early vulnerability, which stems 
from the poor establishment of agentive self-structure. 
Taking the perspective of the developmental psychopatholo-
gist, these distinctions might help us to understand some key 
features of later disturbance, particularly personality disorders. 
It is clear that, associated with certain extreme social dysfunc­
tions—such as childhood maltreatment, environmental trauma 
of various kinds—an individual's capacity to behave with any 
degree of flexibility comes to be compromised. Some of these 
dysfunctions of interpersonal behavior might be understood as 
reflecting an intensified need on the part of the individual to 
demand closer-to-perfect contingent responses from individuals 
with whom they have emotionally loaded relationships. It is as if 
these relationships triggered the need to rediscover the self in 
the response of the other (see chapters 3 and 4) and therefore 
reactivated the need for high levels of contingent responsiveness. 
In later chapters we describe ways in which we think this need is 
unconsciously experienced and'how we understand the patho­
logical solutions that come to be enacted in later attachment 
relationships. 
In the chapters that follow we attempt to integrate the devel­
opmental concepts and research reviewed in the last three chap­
ters with a clinical model for the development of subjectivity (see 
chapter 6) and its distortions in childhood (see chapters 7 and 
10) and adult personality disorders (see chapters 8 and 9). In 
this chapter we hope we have laid the groundwork for the 
developmental models of severe personality problems described 
in the chapters that follow. We hope that we have established 
some of the characteristics of prementalistic functioning that we believe to be relevant to our developmental understanding of 
personality disorder. In general, we believe that many common 
symptoms and problems identified in these patients are "re­
vealed" by absence of mentalistic functioning in the self as agent. 
Features such as impulsivity, emotion dysregulation, and the 
predominance of primitive defenses can be seen either as an 
adaptation of processes that anteceded mentalization or as at­
tempts of the mind to adapt to the limited range of capacities 
available to it, or some combination of these two possibilities.

"Playing with Reality": 
Developmental Research 
and a Psychoanalytic Model 
for the Development of Subjectivity 
This chapter concerns changes in the child's perception of 
psychic reality during normal development, culminating in the 
major shift in the child's understanding of minds (theory of 
mind) at the oedipal stage, which we equate with the qualitative 
shift in the development of mentalization whereby the self be­
comes a representational agent (see chapter 5). We integrate 
empirical studies of this transition with material from the analy­
sis of a 4-year-old girl. We propose a psychoanalytic model of the 
development of an awareness of mental states, which conceives 
of the very young child as using two modes for representing 
internal states or—using psychoanalytic terminology—psychic 
reality; we have called these "psychic equivalent" and "pretend" 
modes, which differ primarily in the assumed relationship be­
tween internal and external realities. We argue that the integra­
tion of the dual modes into a singular reflective mode is normally 
completed by about the age of 4, with the mentalization of affect 
leading the mentalization of belief states or cognitions: the child 
first understands that people have different feelings, then that 
they may have different thoughts about the same external real­
ity. We link Freud's classic notion of psychic reality and current 
psychoanalytic formulations of symbolization. This chapter de­
scribes normal psychological growth in childhood; the next offers 
a further clinical example, which applies the model outlined in 
253 

254 / Developmental Perspectives 
this chapter and chapter 4 to a young child. Chapter 8 concerns 
the changes that occur in adolescence, and the following two 
chapters, using the same developmental model, consider failures 
of these crucial cognitive transitions as seen in adult personality 
disorder. 
THE CONCEPT OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
Most psychoanalysts use the term "psychic reality" informally, 
to mean subjective experience influenced by unconscious pro­
cesses (Michels 1984). Thus in the psychic reality of the patient, 
the analyst may be alternately represented as destructive and 
cruel or perfect and omnipotent in the transference. Freud's 
original concept was of "thought-reality," which he distinguished 
from "external reality." The import of this distinction was that 
internal experience could in certain circumstances be treated as 
though it were as real as the external world, and Freud was 
particularly interested in how the ego judges the "quality" of 
thought and the impact on this ego function of emotional cathe-
xis and language: "Thus thought accompanied by a cathexis of the 
indications of thought-reality or of the indications of speech is the 
highest, securest form of cognitive thought process" (1895, p. 374, 
emphasis in original). In this chapter we investigate how the 
individual experiences and evaluates his "thought-reality" at 
different stages of development and how, all being well, he comes 
to exercise the highest form of cognitive process, a sort of reality 
testing of internal states (Hartmann 1956), in both oneself and 
others. 
Freud went on to use the concept of psychic reality to explain 
how neurotic phenomena provoked by childhood trauma—se­
duction—could be indistinguishable from cases where the sup­
posedly pathogenic events had never taken place (Freud 1900a). 
The events could be "real" psychologically, and the individual 
might react to wishful fantasies in the way that they or others 
would respond to actual events. Freud wrote: "What lie behind 
the sense of guilt of neurotics are always psychical realities and 
never factual ones. What characterizes neurotics is that they 
prefer psychical to factual reality, and react just as seriously to "Playing with Reality" / 255 
thoughts as normal people do to realities" (1912-13, p. 159)*. 
This sense of equivalence is also suggested by Laplanche and 
Pontalis's definition of psychic reality as "whatever in the subr 
ject's psyche presents a consistency and resistance comparable 
to those displayed by material reality" (Laplanche and Pontalis 
1973, p. 363). Freud thought that psychic reality poses a danger 
when there is imperfect discrimination ("reality testing," Brenner 
1955) between stimuli from the outer world and stimuli that 
arise as products of unconscious processes. Although the neu­
rotic adult knows whether experiences originate internally or 
externally, he gives more weight to certain internal experiences 
than he does to his knowledge of the outside world. An obses­
sional person, for instance, "knows" that the door is locked but 
still checks several times, because for him the internal image of 
an unsecured house has much more meaning and power than 
the external images provided by his senses. Because "psychic 
reality" now has a variety of connotations, we use the term 
"psychic equivalence" to denote domination by psychic reality in 
Freud's sense. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF A DEVELOPMENTAL 
PERSPECTIVE 
Ambiguity in the term "psychic reality" may be due to insuffi­
cient utilization of a developmental perspective in psychoanal­
ysis. Arlow (1984) underscores the qualitative differences in the 
perception of physical and human—psychological—realities. We 
may infer from his paper that a robust sense of this psychologi­
cal reality will lag behind the acquisition of a clear portrayal of 
the physical world, both developmentally and in terms of com­
plexity. What may underlie this difference is the relative opaque­
ness of our mental world (Brentano 1874); in fact, the concept of 
psychic reality begs a whole range of questions concerning the 
nature of subjective experience with which, as we have said, 
Freud was grappling from the time of the 1895 "Project" (Freud 
1950 [1895]). How do we know our minds? Is psychic reality 
directly experienced, as perhaps is the case for pain and other

sensations, or are thoughts, beliefs, desires, and intentions— 
mental states—perhaps constructions of our minds, built up 
over the early years of development? If a developmental process 
underlies the evolution of psychic reality, what is its nature, and 
how does the child's subjective experience of reality differ from 
that of the adult? Do psychoanalytic clinical data shed light on 
this evolution? Can we learn from philosophers of mind or obser­
vational studies in developmental psychology about the way 
psychic reality evolves? 
A number of philosophers of mind assume that the experi­
ence of mental states is intrinsic, psychic reality is a "given" 
(e.g., Searle 1983), and awareness of others' mental states is 
arrived at by simulating the mental states of others (Goldman 
1992; Gordon 1986, 1992). The model that we propose places 
Freud's notion of psychic reality in a developmental perspective. 
We have already presented empirical evidence and developmen­
tal observations in the previous three chapters to support the 
view that our understanding of the mental world is not a given, 
is radically different in the young child, and crucially depends 
for its healthy development on interaction with other people who 
are sufficiently benign and reflective. (For a philosophical dem­
onstration of this basic position see Cavell 1991.) In chapter 3 we 
made a claim—one that may be perceived as risky from the point 
of view of cognitive science but is far less so from a psychoana­
lytic perspective—that one of the key evolutionary functions of 
early object relations for humans was to equip the very young 
child with an environment where the processing capacity for the 
understanding of mental states in others and the self can fully 
develop. The social nature of thought is thus part of the very 
essence of subjectivity. 
EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
In chapter 4 we considered evidence that demonstrates that 
from the first months of life a child is intensely concerned about 
the social world (e.g., Stern 1985, 1994; Trevarthen 1980). How-"Playing with Reality" / 257 
ever, it is also evident that the way in which a child of 3 or 4 
years experiences interpersonal reality—and his role within it— 
is qualitatively different from the way that an older child or adult 
experiences it. One instance of this critical difference is in the 
understanding that children have of the mind, in their theory of 
mind (e.g., Baron-Cohen 1995; Mayes and Cohen 1992). The 
ability to attribute intentional mental states—goals, desires, and 
beliefs—to oneself or others as an explanation for actions is not 
fully developed until around 4 years of age (Wellman 1990). 
However, most developmental psychologists believe that precur­
sors of this capacity—pointing and looking, or checking back for 
the caregiver's reaction to strange situations—imply awareness 
of other people's minds in the first year of life (Butterworth, 
Harris, Leslie, and Wellman 1991; Klinnert et al. 1983; see also 
Stern 1985). Gergely's experimental paradigms, described in 
chapters 4 and 5, appear to show that babies of 8 to 9 months 
attribute purpose to events. Soon after the end of the first year 
children show, implicitly, a partial awareness of the difference 
between internal representations and reality. Reddy (1991) offers 
amusing examples of the 1-year-old's awareness of the appear­
ance/reality distinction from his observations of children "muck­
ing about" and demonstrating in their delight that they did not 
really imagine that their mother would allow them to keep the 
whole chocolate bar for themselves, or to walk across the road 
without holding hands, and so on. 
As shown in chapter 5, by the age of 3 years many important 
building blocks for understanding the nature of psychic reality 
are in place (e.g., Wellman 1990). For instance, children can 
distinguish between dream images, thoughts, and real things, 
they start pretend games, and they easily appreciate someone 
else's intention to pretend—for example, that Daddy is a dog. 
Nevertheless, the 2- or 3-year-old's awareness of his inner world 
is markedly different from that of a child in his fifth year. We 
wish to propose that the very small child's sense of psychic 
reality has a dual character. The child generally operates in 
"psychic equivalence" mode, where ideas are not felt to be repre­
sentations but, rather, direct replicas of reality, and conse­
quently always true. At other times, however, the child uses a 
"pretend" mode in which ideas are felt to be representational but

their correspondence with reality is not examined. We will look 
at the evidence for these in turn. 
The "Psychic Equivalence" Mode 
of Experiencing Psychic Reality 
When a 3-year-old is given a sponge that has been painted and 
shaped to look like a rock, his answers to the questions of what 
the object looks like and what it actually is tend to be identical 
(Flavell, Green, and Flavell 1986). The child is shown and al­
lowed to feel the object. 
Q: "What does it look like?" 
A: "It looks like a rock." 
Q: "What is it?" 
A: "It's a rock." 
The child is prompted to squeeze the object. 
Q: "What do you think it is?" 
A; "It's a sponge." 
Q: "What does it look like?" 
A: "It looks like a sponge." 
The child equates appearance and reality. Very young children 
behave as though .their own and others' thoughts faithfully 
mirror the real world. 
Philosophers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
pointed out that once a person can imagine false beliefs, the 
assumption of equivalence between appearance and reality be­
comes untenable (Brentano 1874; B. Russell 1905). Conversely, 
without understanding that the same physical reality can gener­
ate alternative ideas, small children are unlikely to appreciate 
that their beliefs may vary, be false, and differ from those of 
another person. The ability to imagine different perspectives is 
therefore a crucial indicator of the child's assumptions about the "Playing with Reality" / 259 
status of his thoughts: how his psychic reality corresponds to 
the external world. 
We will give one example of many experimental studies of this 
indicator: Perner and his colleagues (Perner et al. 1987) showed 
a series of 3-year-old children a familiar candy box. Each child 
expected the box to be filled with candy but was shown that it 
contained pencils. Each was then asked what they thought their 
friend waiting outside would think the box had in it, to which 
they confidently replied that the other person would think that it 
contained pencils. Here, their current psychic reality, which 
reflected physical reality, dominated their representation of the 
psychic reality of the other, and they appeared not to under­
stand that the other person's belief might be false. They contin­
ued to make this error when they saw the other person respond 
with surprise and when they were explicitly told what the other 
person thought (Moses and Flavell 1990; Wellman 1990). The 
mind of the other could not yet be represented as a separate 
entity, with a potentially different point of view. Equally, the 
children were unable to recall that they themselves had ever 
thought the box had candy in it. They firmly believed that they 
knew it had pencils inside from the beginning, while freely 
admitting other kinds of difficulty or mistake. It seems that, if 
the young child believes something, it must be so; if it is so, then 
someone else will see it in the same way; if it was so before, he 
must have seen it that way before. 
Young children's sense of the psychic reality of their own and 
others' feelings and desires, as opposed to beliefs, seems to be 
more advanced. Children in their second year learn, at least 
superficially, to acknowledge that some wishes may not be ful­
filled (Astington and Gopnik 1991). By the third year they can 
appreciate that their own feelings might not correspond to those 
of other people. "Do you want me to look both ways? I don't 
wanna look both ways!" (Wellman and Banerjee 1991). They are 
more ready to say that they think of something that someone 
else thought was undesirable ("yucky") as desirable ("yummy") 
than they are to recognize an alternative belief as to whether a 
box is full of candy or pencils (Flavell, Flavell, Green, and Moses 
1990). These and other findings are consistent with the psycho­
analytic emphasis, pointing to the developmental lead that emo-

without understanding that the same physical reality can gener­

therefore a crucial indicator of the child's assumptions about the "Playing with Reality" / 259 
status of his thoughts: how his psychic reality corresponds to 
the external world. 
We will give one example of many experimental studies of this

a series of 3-year-old children a familiar candy box. Each child 
expected the box to be filled with candy but was shown that it

someone else will see it in the same way; if it was so before, he 
must have seen it that way before.

analytic emphasis, pointing to the developmental lead that emo-

260 / Developmental Perspectives 
tions and desires have over beliefs and the developmental push 
that we may expect from the child's unfolding .awareness of the 
diversity of desire. 
The young child's need to maintain the equivalence between 
psychic and physical reality is clearest when the external world 
requires an adjustment of his internal representation. It follows 
that when a child is offered an external representation, a sym­
bol, of his mental state, his performance of such tasks should 
improve. This turns out to be the case. When Mitchell and 
Lacohe (1991) gave children a drawing of the chocolate they had 
expected to be in the candy box in the belief-change task, they 
were better able to answer questions concerning both their own 
and others' beliefs. Having access to a token of their belief 
created an identity for it independent of current physical reality. 
In the absence of a representation—or symbol—of their earlier 
representation, these 3-year-old children were unable to keep it 
in mind. 
So how does the 3-year-old understand his mind? What is the 
nature of his psychic reality? The very young child- does not yet 
have the capacity to appreciate the merely representational na­
ture of ideas and feelings. Older children know that what they 
think or believe about something does not necessarily reflect 
reality. The young child; who is not yet able to mentalize, to 
reflect on thoughts and feelings, as it were, from outside, is 
forced to believe that his thoughts and beliefs inevitably and 
correctly mirror the real world. 
Britton has considered the relationship between belief and 
knowledge in Kleinian terms. It is important to clarify the differ­
ence between our position and his related ideas. He describes 
mature mentalization as an "epistemic attitude" in which a 
person can believe but know that he does not know; Britton 
contrasts this with a more psychotic frame of mind: "The con­
trary assumption that belief is knowledge is the basis of delusion 
and characterizes the paranoid-schizoid position. Emancipation 
from the equation of belief with knowledge is an aspect of work­
ing through the depressive position" (1995, p. 22). We suggest 
that although the very young child does in a sense believe that 
belief is knowledge, his attitude differs from that of the psychotic 
in that the child is more inclined to fit "mind-to-world" than "Playing with Reality " / 261 
"world-to-mind" (Searle 1983), and in this way is more like a 
weather-vane than like a psychotic person. When working with 
young children and other patients who are still functioning in 
this mode of psychic experience, it is external reality, not the 
contents of the child's mind, that is immensely and sometimes 
terrifyingly compelling; the child's thoughts and beliefs seem 
very vulnerable and evanescent by contrast. We return to this 
point later, when discussing play. 
The "Pretend" Mode of Experiencing Psychic Reality 
Thus far, we have only looked at one side of this story, which 
may have led readers to feel that we, together with developmen­
tal psychologists, are only looking at the less interesting side of 
the real child, at cognition rather than imagination. We maintain 
that we need to understand the form and limitations of the 
child's thinking, partly in order to understand the great impor­
tance of imagination in his life at this age, and partly in order to 
adopt appropriate techniques with young children and with 
older patients who continue to show these limitations. 
A child can pretend that a chair is a tank and yet not expect it 
to shoot real shells, and there have been experimental demon­
strations that small children can keep alternative or changing 
beliefs in mind if they are doing a task in play rather than for 
real.1 Vygotsky wrote: "in play the child is always above his 
average age, above his daily behavior; in play it is as though he 
were a head taller than himself (1978, p. 102). In the world of 
play it becomes possible partially to free representations from 
their referents and allow these freed representations to be modi­
fied, creating a more flexible mode of thought that encourages

change task. They asked children to pretend that an empty glass had a choco­
late drink in it; the glass was then "pretend emptied" by the adult, and the child 
was asked to pretend that the glass was now full of lemonade. Almost no 3-year-
olds had any difficulty in remembering that the original imagined content was 
chocolate.

tions and desires have over beliefs and the developmental push 
that we may expect from the child's unfolding .awareness of the 
diversity of desire. 
The young child's need to maintain the equivalence between 
psychic and physical reality is clearest when the external world 
requires an adjustment of his internal representation. It follows 
that when a child is offered an external representation, a sym­
bol, of his mental state, his performance of such tasks should 
improve. This turns out to be the case. When Mitchell and 
Lacohe (1991) gave children a drawing of the chocolate they had 
expected to be in the candy box in the belief-change task, they 
were better able to answer questions concerning both their own 
and others' beliefs. Having access to a token of their belief 
created an identity for it independent of current physical reality. 
In the absence of a representation—or symbol—of their earlier 
representation, these 3-year-old children were unable to keep it 
in mind. 
So how does the 3-year-old understand his mind? What is the 
nature of his psychic reality? The very young child- does not yet 
have the capacity to appreciate the merely representational na­
ture of ideas and feelings. Older children know that what they 
think or believe about something does not necessarily reflect 
reality. The young child; who is not yet able to mentalize, to 
reflect on thoughts and feelings, as it were, from outside, is 
forced to believe that his thoughts and beliefs inevitably and 
correctly mirror the real world. 
Britton has considered the relationship between belief and 
knowledge in Kleinian terms. It is important to clarify the differ­
ence between our position and his related ideas. He describes 
mature mentalization as an "epistemic attitude" in which a 
person can believe but know that he does not know; Britton 
contrasts this with a more psychotic frame of mind: "The con­
trary assumption that belief is knowledge is the basis of delusion 
and characterizes the paranoid-schizoid position. Emancipation 
from the equation of belief with knowledge is an aspect of work­
ing through the depressive position" (1995, p. 22). We suggest 
that although the very young child does in a sense believe that 
belief is knowledge, his attitude differs from that of the psychotic 
in that the child is more inclined to fit "mind-to-world" than "Playing with Reality " / 261 
"world-to-mind" (Searle 1983), and in this way is more like a 
weather-vane than like a psychotic person. When working with 
young children and other patients who are still functioning in 
this mode of psychic experience, it is external reality, not the 
contents of the child's mind, that is immensely and sometimes 
terrifyingly compelling; the child's thoughts and beliefs seem 
very vulnerable and evanescent by contrast. We return to this 
point later, when discussing play. 
The "Pretend" Mode of Experiencing Psychic Reality 
Thus far, we have only looked at one side of this story, which 
may have led readers to feel that we, together with developmen­
tal psychologists, are only looking at the less interesting side of 
the real child, at cognition rather than imagination. We maintain 
that we need to understand the form and limitations of the 
child's thinking, partly in order to understand the great impor­
tance of imagination in his life at this age, and partly in order to 
adopt appropriate techniques with young children and with 
older patients who continue to show these limitations. 
A child can pretend that a chair is a tank and yet not expect it 
to shoot real shells, and there have been experimental demon­
strations that small children can keep alternative or changing 
beliefs in mind if they are doing a task in play rather than for 
real.1 Vygotsky wrote: "in play the child is always above his 
average age, above his daily behavior; in play it is as though he 
were a head taller than himself (1978, p. 102). In the world of 
play it becomes possible partially to free representations from 
their referents and allow these freed representations to be modi­
fied, creating a more flexible mode of thought that encourages 
the emergence of latent mental structures (Marans et al. 1991).

developmentally surpassed, or only just being formed to occupy 
center stage. Thus playing or pretending at times reveals sur­
prising competencies, while at other times it offers opportunities 
for regression and the expression of unconscious concerns. 
When small children are asked to visualize something that does 
not exist, they readily understand the phrase, "make a picture in 
your head." They use.the metaphor of the head as a container in 
which imaginary situations or objects may be created and exam­
ined. When playing, even the young child has a mentalizing 
model of psychic experience and sees his mind as representing 
ideas, desires, and other feelings. However, it seems to be neces­
sary for children of this age to prevent correspondence between 
the "pretend world" and external reality in the "pretend" modes 
of thinking. Not surprisingly, the difference between the equiva­
lent and pretend mode has to be clearly marked, and the lack 
of correspondence to actual reality is frequently exaggerated 
(Fonagy and Fonagy 1995). If this is not ensured, it quickly 
becomes clear just how threatening the isomorphism of internal 
and external realities can become for the child, who has limited 
awareness of the implications and realistic dangers of many 
events. Although the child strictly separates the two realities in 
his thinking, his affective investment in his play may directly 
reflect the extent to which his phantasy incorporates a.disguised 
piece of "serious" reality, such as the relationship between his 
parents or the imagined consequences of acting on dangerous 
wishes. 
Two examples from normal development may illustrate the 
potency of thought for the small child. A 4-year-old boy was read 
a ghost story by his mother. Although the story was not expected 
to be particularly frightening, he was visibly shaken by it. The 
mother quickly offered reassurance: "Don't worry, Simon, it 
didn't really happen." The child, clearly feeling misunderstood, 
protested in reply: "But when you read it, it did really happen to 
me!" A further example is provided by the father of a 3-year-old 
boy, whose son asked him to find a Batman outfit on his trip 
abroad. The father had great difficulty, but eventually he found a 
fancy-dress shop and bought an expensive costume. Unfortu­
nately, the costume was so realistic that the boy was frightened 
when he saw himself in the mirror, refused to wear it again, and 
I-"Playing with Reality" / 263 
went back to using his mother's skirt as his Batman cloak. 
Similarly, the common observation that children of 2 or 3 spend 
much time together "scene-setting," negotiating the roles and 
rules of their pretend games, sometimes leaving little opportu­
nity for entering into the game itself, underlines the importance 
of a clear division between "playing" and "reality" for children of 
this age. 
When adults think about children playing, they often think of 
it using their own, rather than the child's, perspective on psy­
chic reality. It is easy to assume that because a child at play can 
reflect on states of mind including false beliefs, he is able to do 
this outside his play. The small child playing can think about 
thoughts as thoughts because these are clearly and deliberately 
stripped of their connection to the real world of people and even 
things. It is also easy to overlook the fact that the child may only 
be able to reflect on thoughts and feelings about real-life events 
during play if an adult is there to provide a necessary frame and 
insulate him from the compelling character of external reality. 
Winnicott recognized the vital mediating role children need from 
adults in order to play. He pointed out that our attitude toward 
play "must include recognition that playing is always liable to 
become frightening. Games and their organization must be 
looked at as part of an attempt to forestall the frightening aspect 
of playing. The precariousness of play belongs to the fact that it 
is always on the theoretical line between the subjective and that 
which is objectively perceived" (1971, pp. 58-59). The very young 
child's understanding of minds may be developmental^ ad­
vanced in play because of the segregation of this from external 
reality, and the avoidance of the sense of encroachment of reality 
on thought, which the child would otherwise experience. 
The Integration of Dual Modes of Experience: 
Learning to Mentalize 
In the fourth and fifth year, the "psychic equivalence" and "pre­
tend" modes normally become increasingly integrated, and a 
reflective or mentalizing mode of psychic reality is established 
(Gopnik 1993). Children begin to acknowledge that things may

In the fourth and fifth year, the "psychic equivalence" and "pre­
tend" modes normally become increasingly integrated, and a 
reflective or mentalizing mode of psychic reality is established 
(Gopnik 1993). Children begin to acknowledge that things may 

264 / Developmental Perspectives 
not be what they appear to be, that another person may perceive 
external reality differently, that beliefs may be held with different 
degrees of certainty, and that they felt differently in the past 
about something (Baron-Cohen et al. 1985). With this new way 
of thinking about his experience, the child not only shows an 
understanding that his own and his object's behavior make 
sense in terms of mental states, but also learns to recognize that 
these states are representations, which may be fallible and may 
change because they are based on but one of a range of possible 
perspectives. 
We must emphasize the crucial importance of this cognitive 
integration and acquisition of the capacity to mentalize: (a) It 
brings with it the possibility of continuity in the experience of 
the psychological self (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 1993). The 
child can fit his thinking to the world without feeling as though 
he has to change himself in order to change his mind (literally 
has to "change his mind"), losing continuity with the self that 
thought before, (b) It enables the child to see people's actions as 
meaningful through the attribution of thoughts and feelings. 
This means that their actions become predictable, which in turn 
reduces moment-to-moment dependency on others. This is an 
important component of the process of individuation. The child 
of around 4 or 5 years is frequently able to understand what the 
mother is doing and why, without her needing constantly to bear 
his limited perspective in mind. ("I can't do that now because I am 
worried about granny's illness," etc.). This allows both child and 
caregiver to attain increasing mental and physical independ­
ence, needing to refer far less to each other in order to allow the 
child to borrow the mother's understanding, (c) It allows for a 
distinction between inner and outer truth, enabling the child to 
understand that the fact that someone is behaving in a particu­
lar way does not mean that things are like that. While this may 
not be important in all contexts, we believe that it becomes 
critical in cases of maltreatment or trauma, allowing the child to 
survive psychologically and relieving the pressure to relive the 
experience in concrete ways. Once the child can mentalize, he 
has available a crucial attenuating function for psychic experi­
ence, (d) Without a clear representation of the mental state of the 
other, communication must be profoundly limited. The philoso-

sation as one of collaboration, whereby the effective speaker 
needs constantly to bear in mind the other person's point of 
view. The absence or underdevelopment of the capacity to 
mentalize can have a limiting effect on the possibility of doing 
analytic work, and there are implications for technique when 
undertaking analysis of such persons, (e) Finally and most im­
portantly, mentalizing can help an individual to achieve a higher 
level of intersubjectivity, in terms of deeper experiences with 
others and ultimately a life experienced as more meaningful. 
We think that it is the successful connecting of internal and 
external that allows belief to be endowed with meaning that is 
emotionally alive but is manageable and therefore does not have 
to be defended against. A partial failure to achieve this integra­
tion can lead to neurotic states. In more profound and pervasive 
failures of integration, reality may be experienced as emotionally 
meaningless. In such cases other people and the self are related 
to as things, and the relating itself occurs at a very concrete 
level. It must not be forgotten, however, that achievement of the 
capacity to mentalize also has the potential massively to increase 
conflict, when fantasies such as oedipal wishes become stable 
representations that can be set against external reality. As Win­
nicott (1971) wrote: 
It is assumed here that the task of reality acceptance is never 
completed, that no human being is free from the strain of relat­
ing inner and outer reality, and that relief from this strain is 
provided by an intermediate area of experience (cf. Riviere, 1936) 
which is not challenged (arts, religion, etc.). This intermediate 
area is in direct continuity with the play area of the small child 
who is "lost" in play." [p. 15]

THE ROLE OF THE OTHER IN DEVELOPING 
THE CAPACITY TO MENTALIZE 
Most developmentalists regard the development of mentalizing 
capacity as simply maturational. Many psychoanalytic theories 
of development have assumed that the self develops transcen-

"

dentally, from within the individual. In his paper on narcissism 
(Freud 1914c), Freud argued that there was "an original libidinal 
cathexis of the ego, from which some is later given off to objects, 
but which fundamentally persists and is related to the object-
cathexis much as the body of an amoeba is related to the 
pseudopodia which it puts out" (p. 75). For Freud, in infancy and 
early childhood others in the external world are extensions of the 
self. While this may be an accurate description of the phenom­
enology, for us it seems more accurate to see the self as origi­
nally an extension of experience of the other. Its development is 
an interpersonal process requiring interaction with the minds of 
others, as described in relation to earlier infancy. In this chap­
ter, we argue that the involvement of the caregiver, and to a 
lesser extent of older siblings, is crucial in helping the child of 3 
or 4. years to accept the two realities, internal and external, 
without needing to split his ego functioning to maintain dual 
modes of thinking. 
In order to achieve the integration of a nonmentalizing reality-
oriented and mentalizing nonreality-connected mode, to create 
fully mentalized psychic;reality, the child needs repeated experi­
ence of three things: his current mental states, these states 
represented—thought about—in the object's mind, and the 
frame represented by the adult's normally externally reality-
oriented perspective. We believe that the "frame" provided by the 
parent, or by other children, is an essential part of this model. 
The child needs an adult or older child who will "play along," so 
that the child can see his fantasy or idea represented in the 
adult's mind, reintroject this, and use it as a representation of 
his own thinking. When the omniscient and omnipotent parent 
playfully pretends with the child that a banana is a telephone, 
the child is able simultaneously to equate the apparent and the 
real while clarifying the distinction between pretend and serious 
mode. He becomes able to "know about" his idea or wish, along­
side experiencing it. By entering into the child's world in a 
playful way, the child sees the adult adopting an "as-if' attitude 
to his intentional state. The frame is present so that he knows 
that his thoughts or feelings are not "for real," yet he perceives 
them outside, in the parent's mind. Linking his internal state to "Playing with Reality" / 267 
a perception of that state outside offers a representation—a 
symbol—of the internal state: it corresponds to, yet it is not 
equivalent to, the state. The playful attitude of the parent is 
crucial. The child's mental state must be represented sufficiently 
clearly and accurately for the child to recognize it, yet suffi­
ciently playfully for the child not to be overwhelmed by its 
realness. In this way he can ultimately use the parent's repre­
sentation of his internal reality as the seed for his own symbolic 
thought, his representation of his own representations. 
If the adult's attitude precludes the duality of holding the 
frame of external reality while offering mirroring or reflection, 
the child's transition toward Integration and mentalization may 
be jeopardized. He may not feel free—secure—to explore the 
adult's mind and find himself in it, or what he finds there may be 
a distorted, spoiled picture of his mental state, which the child 
cannot safely use to represent his experience. If, on the other 
hand, the caregiver can frequently provide links between reality 
and fantasy in a way that includes an accepting, recognizable 
reflection of the child's mental states, then he affords the child a 
basis for organizing and comparing numerous experiences bridg­
ing the psychic equivalence and pretend modes. Gradually, the 
child comes to be able to maintain a mentalizing stance himself, 
having internalized the process through repeated interactions 
with the caregiver and probably also with other children. The 
essence of the process is not simply play, but play that breaks 
away from psychic equivalence while retaining contact with real­
ity. In other words, the child, using the parent's mind, is able to 
play with reality. 
We suggest that it is no coincidence that the child makes, or 
fails to make, this cognitive transition at the time traditionally 
associated with oedipal conflict. A number of writers have re­
cently suggested that successful working-through of the oedipal 
situation involves the sort of opening-up of thinking into a 
triangular space which we and others suggest can occur through 
play with reality. Following Hanna Segal's (1957) work on symbol 
formation and Bion's (1970) abstract exploration of the oedipal 
triangle as a model, Ogden (1985) conceives of the pretend mode 
of functioning as developed out of the triangularity of the sym-

with the caregiver and probably also with other children. The 
essence of the process is not simply play, but play that breaks 
away from psychic equivalence while retaining contact with real­
ity. In other words, the child, using the parent's mind, is able to 
play with reality. 
We suggest that it is no coincidence that the child makes, or 
fails to make, this cognitive transition at the time traditionally 
associated with oedipal conflict. A number of writers have re­
cently suggested that successful working-through of the oedipal 
situation involves the sort of opening-up of thinking into a 
triangular space which we and others suggest can occur through 
play with reality. Following Hanna Segal's (1957) work on symbol 
formation and Bion's (1970) abstract exploration of the oedipal 
triangle as a model, Ogden (1985) conceives of the pretend mode 
of functioning as developed out of the triangularity of the sym-

bol, the symbolized, and the interpreting subject. Britton (1989, 
1994) has done much to explore the source and significance of 
this triangularity, in the context of applying depressive-position 
thinking to the mourning involved in resolving the oedipal situa­
tion. He argues that not only does the acceptance of internal 
triangular relationships provide space for thinking and the pos­
sibility of looking at.dyadic relationships from the perspective of 
a third, but it consolidates the depressive position and provides 
a "stabilizing structure" (Britton 1994). He emphasizes that an 
important aspect of the triangular oedipal situation is that it 
enables the child to conceive of being observed and, by implica­
tion, being thought about: "This provides us with a capacity for 
seeing ourselves in interaction with others and for entertaining 
another point of view whilst retaining our own, for reflecting on 
ourselves whilst being ourselves" (Britton 1989, p. 87). We sug­
gest that this capacity is specifically fostered by the support of 
adults or sometimes of other children for the child's play, provid­
ing a safe internal context in which to reflect; the child can trust 
the other person to know about reality. 
Although we have emphasized the transition that normally 
occurs around 4 years of age, we must emphasize that the ability 
to represent mental states is not acquired all at once; rather, it is 
a developmental achievement, which, like all mental capacities, 
may be present to a greater or lesser extent in any individual at 
any one time. The tendency of the empirical data we have re­
ferred to is to suggest that in some sense the function does not 
exist until the child "passes" a task in an experimental situation. 
(Experimentalists are usually, of course, as aware as anyone else 
that no capacity emerges suddenly into the mind-and that all 
that the experimental task can imply is that from that moment 
the child is likely to be able to perform that function in that 
situation.) The experimentalist frame of reference is con­
cerned with demonstrable causes and effects. Observers of child 
behavior, whether clinical or social psychological (e.g., Dunn 
1994), are interpreting the child's behavior with a developmental 
end-point in mind and can thus see components of a function in 
the process of coming together. The weakness of this interpretive 
tradition is the unavoidable tendency to ascribe to the child the "Playing with Reality" / 269 
full capacity, on the basis of what must be partial evidence. Our 
formulation is linked to the current Kleinian view that there is 
continuing oscillation or equilibrium (Bion 1963) between the 
paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions in the face of new 
experience. Even after integration has taken place, emotional 
factors can impede the availability of the capacity for mental­
ization in specific areas. Steiner (1992) explores the defenses 
operating at different levels within the two basic Kleinian posi­
tions, and his discussion of the differentiation within the depres­
sive position is relevant to the transition we have written about 
in this chapter. At the risk of oversimplifying Steiner's subtle 
distinctions, we suggest that the "normal splitting" he describes 
in the depressive position, at the level of "fear of loss of the 
object," may be thought of—at least in the young child—as 
including operating with a dual mode of psychic reality. The 
mode of psychic equivalence might then be seen as operating 
through (relatively benign) projective identification, which he 
describes as a key mechanism in reducing this fear of loss. The 
more mature depressive position, as described by Steiner, in­
volves "experience of loss of the object," relinquishing (the 
phantasy of) control of the object, and allowing separation and 
mourning to take place. While in this paper Steiner does not link 
the process to the resolution of the oedipal situation, we specu­
late that, in normal development, accepting the loss of the illu­
sion of exclusive possession and allowing the emergence of a 
triangular relationship may be a major turning point that offers 
the opportunity to function at the higher level within the depres­
sive position, and that this is crucially connected with accepting 
that ideas are merely ideas. 
We would like now to illustrate these ideas with material from 
an analysis during which a young child overcame her resistance 
to this developmental progress and was thus enabled to link her 
two modes of understanding psychic reality and to find a greater 
integration of inner and outer.

FRAGMENT FROM THE PSYCHOANALYTIC 
TREATMENT OF AN UNDER-FIVE: 
"REBECCA" 
Rebecca2 was a pretty little girl, charming and precocious, even 
when clearly depressed. When she was 4 years old, her mother 
brought her to the Anna Freud Centre because over the past 
year she had developed a variety of problems, including recur­
rent nightmares, daytime terrors often but not always associated 
with separation, demanding clinginess, and other indications of 
her anxiety, such as hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and fear of 
loneliness and death. At times her anxiety led her to be destruc­
tive, disobedient, and aggressive and a bit of a bully at school as 
well as with her mother. In her assessment she was willing to 
talk about her nightmares and her fear of spiders and snails. 
She went on to enact a scene of a Daddy doll cuddling 
Mommy doll, which she concluded by banging the Daddy figure's 
head on the skirting-board, announcing that he was killed, and 
taking him off the scene. In this way she quickly communicated 
her murderous fantasy about why her father had been absent 
from her life. Rebecca was the only child of an unmarried young 
woman who had given birth to her at 18, having had two previ­
ous terminations. The mother was ambitious and impatient to 
pursue a career. Rebecca's father was a casual partner of the 
mother; he apparently totally withdrew from her soon after her 
pregnancy was confirmed. Rebecca had never met her father, 
although she had a photograph of him, which she frequentiy 
looked at. She had often said that she wanted to meet him, but 
by the time of the referral these demands had abated. In her 
interview with me, Rebecca's mother became immediately tearful 
when the issue of her feelings about the father of this child was 
raised. She made it clear that she felt quite unable to address 
this subject with her daughter. 
Rebecca had been brought up in a complicated environment, 
partly with her grandparents and partly with her mother, who

worked as a child-minder. The household included her mother's 
occasional partners and other children from her grandfather's 
previous marriages. In her fourth year, her charismatic grandfa­
ther died. Rebecca's mother's bereavement reaction signaled the 
onset of Rebecca's symptoms. 
There were difficulties in the initial phase of Rebecca's treat­
ment. She insisted that her mother should stay in the room, yet 
she was clearly inhibited by her presence, her play subdued and 
repetitive. She drew stereotyped figures, each drawing having to 
be shown to mother, and her defensive exclusion of me was 
clear. I decided to tackle her anxiety directly, that a relationship 
with me would exclude her Mommy, which might make Mommy 
become angry and love her less. Although this allowed her to let 
her mother leave the room, her anxiety had not abated entirely. 
Being alone with me made her immensely anxious. She defended 
against the anxiety by taking command of the environment. She 
ordered me, in an agitated way, to rearrange the positions of the 
chairs, her play table, and even my big desk, and then she 
charged me with the task of controlling the lights, to help her to 
"organize the show." It was daylight, so it was clear that the 
lights stood for another aspect of the environment that she 
needed desperately to bring under her control. I felt that she was 
moving the external furniture, both to make the unfamiliar 
territory of the consulting-room as much hers as mine and to 
prevent us from moving forward in our dialogue about her state 
of mind. I said that she felt worried she would be moved around 
by me, like she moved the furniture about. But while, she moved 
the furniture, she didn't have to think about her worries. Later, I 
added that it was terribly hard for her that our time together 
began and ended so abruptly, just as the light came on for such 
brief moments. 
This refocusing on her psychic reality was helpful. Rebecca's 
pattern of play then changed. She started playing with Plasti-
cene (modeling clay), her declared intention being to "make 
a Plasticene world." My role was to "make the Plasticene 
soft," while she molded the figures. This was the first time that 
Rebecca played with me cooperatively. She symbolically con­
veyed her need for me to make pliable the harsh and fixed ideas 
in her mind, which she was not able to manipulate. She con-

272 / Developmental Perspectives 
firmed the generality of my feeling about the role she put me into 
by claiming that she had made a "Plasticene world blanket," 
which would cover everyone and everything, and she placed all 
the figures in her toy box under the flat piece of Plasticene she 
made. The task was difficult; even though she flattened a size­
able piece of Plasticene, it could not cover all the figures 
properly. Despite her careful positioning, some were "left out in 
the cold." Noticing her anxiety about this, I commented that I 
thought it might be troubling her that someone might be shut 
out of our little world. She confirmed that the source of her 
anxiety might have, at least in part, been the exclusiveness of my 
relationship with her, by rolling up the "world blanket" so that 
there was room for only two of the figures under it; all the others 
were put back into the box with great care. I noticed that the last 
to be tentatively picked up were the Mommy and Granny dolls. I 
said: "Many children are frightened about coming up here and 
leaving their Mommy downstairs. Sometimes they are frightened 
about what might happen to their Mommies, and sometimes 
about what might happen to them." She then went on to play 
with the Plasticene on her own, rolling a piece into the shape of a 
snake, and placing it round a doll's head, like a crown. She 
commented that all the other figures were frightened of the little 
girl doll, because she had the big snake. I said that the big snake 
was like the worries inside her head, which were scaring her 
when her mother wasn't there to protect her, now but also at 
night. She looked up at me and smiled slightly for the first time 
and said that the people were only pretending to be frightened of 
the snake. I said that I was sure that people often told her that 
she should not feel frightened because there was nothing there 
really to be afraid of, but the two of us knew that her worries felt 
terribly real. She said: "You mean, like the pirates?" I said: 
"Perhaps when you can't see Mommy, you are frightened that 
she might he taken away by pirates?" To my surprise, she said, 
"She is." Only subsequently did I understand that in her night­
mares and daytime terrors, her mother or her grandmother were 
abducted by pirates. My acceptance of the reality of her anxieties 
and other emotions was critical in freeing her mind from the grip 
of the worry-snakes. "Playing with Reality" / 273 
At this time Rebecca began to play more complex games, and 
her oedipal anxieties, distorted by the circumstances of her 
childhood, came to the fore. She played royal families: the king 
and queen doll had a daughter. The daughter doll was aban­
doned when the king and queen dolls cuddled, but later she was 
inserted between the king and queen doll. The sexualization of 
this theme was made more explicit by the whole scene being 
transferred to the couch and everyone jumping about until the 
daughter doll fell off. Then there was a street fire, which filled 
the house with smoke and burned down the whole street. I said: 
"I know some little girls who are very frightened of being so 
excited, because their thoughts make them feel hot and muddled 
and then everything goes wrong." She said: "I think I am one of 
those girls." 
Much of Rebecca's treatment consisted of a single game, with 
apparently infinite variations. In the game, she is a somewhat 
older girl, Hannah, who has a father, which was the analyst's 
role. Hannah and her father "Peter" had many adventures, most 
of which involved visiting Hannah's friend, "pretend Rebecca,"3 
who lived in the same house as real Rebecca but whcj—in the 
game—had a father "Jeff as well as a mother. Jeff was a pa­
thetic, incompetent figure who frequently got things wrong, and 
on such occasions would often be unceremoniously dismissed, 
mostly by mother and sometimes by her. Hannah would sensi­
tively intercede with pretend Rebecca and Rebecca's mother on 
Jeffs behalf: "You don't understand him!" she berated pretend 
Rebecca on one occasion, "He is only upset because you told him 
off for making a mess." I, as Hannah's father, was encouraged to 
do the same: "Let's pretend that Rebecca does not understand. 
You pretend to tell her (pretend Rebecca) that she is not being 
nice to him." I said she (Rebecca) perhaps did not want to 
understand because it was frightening to think that her anger 
could be so powerful that it could send a big man like Jeff away 
and she was very frightened of feeling angry. 
3 Pretend Rebecca was an imaginary friend. She shared the patient's first 
name but was definitely not identical with the narrator (the patient or real 
Rebecca). Both patient and analyst talked to her, and the patient, mostly as 
Hannah, spoke for her.

Hannah, spoke for her. 

274 / Developmental Perspectives 
Rebecca's rage with her mother for not providing her with a 
father also quickly surfaced in these interchanges, as did her 
shame and frustration about failing to hold on to him herself. 
For instance, on one occasion, Hannah berated her mother for 
not looking after the family dog, which then went missing and 
Hannah's Daddy had to go out to find it and therefore could not 
be there to play with Hannah. Rebecca, playing Hannah, quite 
angry and flushed, remonstrated with the chair where the imagi­
nary mother was sitting: "It's all your fault that Daddy isn't in!" I 
reflected that Hannah was very, very upset, and that perhaps 
she felt that Hannah's mother had let the dog go deliberately. 
Hannah confirmed my suspicion and, still in role, added: "She 
didn't want us to be playing making breakfast." Later on in the 
game, it turned out that Hannah had lost the dog herself but 
was embarrassed to admit it. I was able to address Hannah's 
anger from a slightly different viewpoint: "Perhaps Hannah got 
so angry with her Mom because she felt ashamed of losing the 
dog and spoiling the chance to play with Daddy." Rebecca agreed 
that she probably must have done. 
Gradually, the terrifying fantasy that her father had died in 
an overwhelmingly exciting sexual union with her mother was 
enacted, and I was able to interpret her terror that he (as Jeff) 
might run away because he was so frightened of both her and 
her mother's violent rage and voracious, man-consuming sexual 
appetites. All this is par for the analytic course and clearly 
illustrates aspects of this child's psychic reality. Here, we want 
to focus on a specific feature of the work with her: the impor­
tance of the subtle distinctions between pretense and reality in 
Rebecca's games and what was learned about the nature of her 
problems through playing with reality. 
The confusion of identities was a recurrent theme. When 
Hannah stayed at Rebecca's overnight, her father came to find 
her in Rebecca's bedroom but, unbeknownst to him, Hannah 
and Rebecca had changed places in the bunk beds. Looking for 
Hannah and finding Rebecca, he would be surprised. Depending 
on the context, there was much to interpret in this game. On one 
occasion, when both Hannah and pretend Rebecca seemed par­
ticularly excited about whom Hannah's father was going to find, 
I could point to both Hannah's and pretend Rebecca's wish to be 
a "Playing with Reality" / 275 
found, as father's special person. The oedipal wish to be found 
by the father, defensively displaced to a pretend child, was self-
evident. However, this scenario occurred so often that clearly 
there were many other determinants: the transference gratifica­
tion of externalizing her confusion onto the adult analyst, repre­
senting in the transference the muddled character of her 
internal world with its confusions of identities; the split in her 
self- and object-representations between an idealized Hannah, 
who had control over her father, and the impoverished Rebecca, 
struggling to maintain her self-esteem with her delinquent, un­
caring paternal figure. No single interpretation seemed crucially 
important, and the game continued. The scenario offered by 
Rebecca, marked by the experience of surprise, seemed above all 
to create a rich opportunity to speculate about what everybody 
in the story was thinking. For example, pretend Rebecca's father 
would be incessantly quizzed by pretend Rebecca: "What did you 
think when you found Hannah? Did you think I had gone?" At 
other times when Jeff could not be found, patient and analyst 
would spend considerable time trying to work out why he was 
not there and what pretend Rebecca thought about it. 
Trickiest to tackle was the narrator's (Rebecca's) experience 
that, during the games, she, as Hannah or the pretend Rebecca, 
experienced me as her father, in all the roles I was assigned. 
There was no instance when Hannah or pretend Rebecca ad­
dressed me in any way other than as Daddy. When I spoke as an 
analyst, Rebecca immediately switched out of the game. When 
Rebecca needed slight limit-setting, to be dissuaded from leaning 
too far when looking out of the window, the Hannah game would 
come to an abrupt halt unless I intervened as the pretend father. 
I noticed in the counter-transference how hard it felt to address 
my actual role vis-a-vis real Rebecca, as narrator. It seemed 
impossible to make any observation on why Rebecca might be 
playing this game. There seemed to be no room for interpretation 
in this domain, because Rebecca and I were dealing with her 
experience of an actuality. For Rebecca, and probably for all 
children at her stage of development, the transference was, at 
the moment she felt it, not a fantasy but a subjective experience 
as real as that of a physical object. On one occasion, when Jeff 
had disappeared, Rebecca was almost in tears. I said, "It is 

274 / Developmental Perspectives 
Rebecca's rage with her mother for not providing her with a 
father also quickly surfaced in these interchanges, as did her 
shame and frustration about failing to hold on to him herself. 
For instance, on one occasion, Hannah berated her mother for 
not looking after the family dog, which then went missing and 
Hannah's Daddy had to go out to find it and therefore could not 
be there to play with Hannah. Rebecca, playing Hannah, quite 
angry and flushed, remonstrated with the chair where the imagi­
nary mother was sitting: "It's all your fault that Daddy isn't in!" I 
reflected that Hannah was very, very upset, and that perhaps 
she felt that Hannah's mother had let the dog go deliberately. 
Hannah confirmed my suspicion and, still in role, added: "She 
didn't want us to be playing making breakfast." Later on in the 
game, it turned out that Hannah had lost the dog herself but 
was embarrassed to admit it. I was able to address Hannah's 
anger from a slightly different viewpoint: "Perhaps Hannah got 
so angry with her Mom because she felt ashamed of losing the 
dog and spoiling the chance to play with Daddy." Rebecca agreed 
that she probably must have done. 
Gradually, the terrifying fantasy that her father had died in 
an overwhelmingly exciting sexual union with her mother was 
enacted, and I was able to interpret her terror that he (as Jeff) 
might run away because he was so frightened of both her and 
her mother's violent rage and voracious, man-consuming sexual 
appetites. All this is par for the analytic course and clearly 
illustrates aspects of this child's psychic reality. Here, we want 
to focus on a specific feature of the work with her: the impor­
tance of the subtle distinctions between pretense and reality in 
Rebecca's games and what was learned about the nature of her 
problems through playing with reality. 
The confusion of identities was a recurrent theme. When 
Hannah stayed at Rebecca's overnight, her father came to find 
her in Rebecca's bedroom but, unbeknownst to him, Hannah 
and Rebecca had changed places in the bunk beds. Looking for 
Hannah and finding Rebecca, he would be surprised. Depending 
on the context, there was much to interpret in this game. On one 
occasion, when both Hannah and pretend Rebecca seemed par­
ticularly excited about whom Hannah's father was going to find, 
I could point to both Hannah's and pretend Rebecca's wish to be 
a "Playing with Reality" / 275 
found, as father's special person. The oedipal wish to be found 
by the father, defensively displaced to a pretend child, was self-
evident. However, this scenario occurred so often that clearly 
there were many other determinants: the transference gratifica­
tion of externalizing her confusion onto the adult analyst, repre­
senting in the transference the muddled character of her 
internal world with its confusions of identities; the split in her 
self- and object-representations between an idealized Hannah, 
who had control over her father, and the impoverished Rebecca, 
struggling to maintain her self-esteem with her delinquent, un­
caring paternal figure. No single interpretation seemed crucially 
important, and the game continued. The scenario offered by 
Rebecca, marked by the experience of surprise, seemed above all 
to create a rich opportunity to speculate about what everybody 
in the story was thinking. For example, pretend Rebecca's father 
would be incessantly quizzed by pretend Rebecca: "What did you 
think when you found Hannah? Did you think I had gone?" At

had disappeared, Rebecca was almost in tears. I said, "It is 

276 / Developmental Perspectives 
terribly hard for little girls who have never had a father at home 
to think about fathers who might suddenly disappear, without a 
clue as to where they might be." I was thus addressing the 
narrator's, rather than pretend Rebecca's, sadness that her fa­
ther had gone. Here, Rebecca immediately stopped the game. 
The next session, Rebecca cheerfully announced that she had 
met her father and described him as tall, bearded, and bald. I 
said that yesterday I had muddled and somehow spoiled there 
being a real father, but Rebecca knew how important it was for 
them to have him here, and she was helping by bringing another 
picture of him. For the first time, she cried and eventually said, 
"You look just like a Daddy, but I know you are my therapist." In 
this way Rebecca made me recognize the sadness involved in 
giving up the momentary illusion of the equivalence of thought 
and reality. 
Very gradually I interpreted what was evident from the first 
time we played this game: Rebecca's unbearable disappointment 
at realizing that her wish for her grandfather or the analyst to be 
her real father did not make it true. In the role plays she could 
explore her confusion about why her father refused to acknowl­
edge paternity and why her mother, who clearly felt guilty and 
angry, could not discuss the matter with her, and how real it felt 
to her that if she demanded to see her father, her mother would 
send her away in anger, as she had the father. 
The following vignette illustrates some aspects of the change 
in the nature of the material. In one session, Rebecca was 
excited about going to see the musical "Oliver." She claimed that 
she was only going for the songs, because they were funny, then 
added "Oliver was lost, very sad you know," and nodded em­
phatically. I said that I supposed Rebecca wanted to concentrate 
on the funny parts, because she, like Oliver, so often felt lost and 
alone. Rebecca then asked, "Do you know that babies are very 
sad without daddies?" She then asked me to play the giraffe 
game, with a shadow-puppet daddy giraffe and baby giraffe. The 
daddy giraffe was expected to teach baby giraffe about jumping, 
walking, and eating from trees. Although the phallic narcissistic 
aspects of this game were evident, I only took her enjoyment of 
this game up in the context of it making her sadness better to 
feel that the giraffe baby had such a clever giraffe daddy, "Playing with Reality" / 277 
because she was so sad that she did not have a real Daddy to 
teach her and that I was not really a proper Daddy to her either. 
She turned to face me, and, looking at me in a somewhat school-
marmish way, she said, "You are just a shadow Daddy." 
Psychoanalytic Conceptualization 
Most psychoanalytic formulations of therapeutic action share 
two principal propositions (e.g., Abrams 1987, 1990)—namely, 
that pathology is associated with the persistence of develop-
mentally primitive mental structures, and that psychoanalysis 
exerts its mutative influence through a process of reorganization 
and integration of repudiated unconscious mental structures 
with developmentally higher-order conscious ones. To take 
one example, Rebecca's fantasy about the mother having driven 
away or killed the father, wherein the mother is seen as a 
terrifying monster, was a primitive idea amplified by the projec­
tion of Rebecca's own considerable aggression. Rebecca had got 
stuck with this developmentally primitive, unconscious picture, 
unmodulated by higher-level thinking. Her analysis helped her 
to reintegrate the repudiated and threatening phantasies rooted 
in her father's absence from her life, amplified by oedipal and 
more regressive omnipotent phantasies, structured to protect 
her injured narcissism. From a modern Kleinian perspective 
(e.g., Spillius 1994), one might add that the projective identifica­
tion of Rebecca's terrifying envy and rage with the mother 
(characteristic of the developmentally primitive paranoid-schiz­
oid mode of thought), together with her total dependence on her 
single and rather unpredictable parent, led to a persistent split 
in her representation of objects and in her own immature ego. 
Thus, although she was in many ways functioning well, Rebecca 
was prevented from developing a more integrated view of the 
mother characteristic of the experience of objects in the depres­
sive position (Klein 1935, 1940). 
These ways of thinking about Rebecca's difficulties are helpful 
in understanding aspects of the analytic material. However, it is 
clear that in most traditional psychoanalytic accounts meta­
phors referring to developmental arrest or changes in psychic

clear that in most traditional psychoanalytic accounts meta­
phors referring to developmental arrest or changes in psychic 

278 / Developmental Perspectives 
structures as accounts of pathology and therapeutic action turn 
out, upon closer scrutiny, to be relatively empty and circular, 
given the lack of specificity about the ways in which the young 
child's inner experience differs from that of an older one and how 
the former places the child at risk of disturbance and the latter 
may come to the rescue in the context of the psychoanalytic 
encounter. 
Rebecca and Her Analysis: Play and the Self 
What do the empirical findings and our model of cognitive devel­
opment have to say about Rebecca's difficulties and their treat­
ment? Rebecca's behavior was fully symbolic and could not be 
regarded as "concrete" in any general sense. She initiated pre­
tend play with her analyst and readily accepted the analyst's 
establishment of the analytic situation as one where pretend 
play was welcome. She could label and talk about her feelings, 
dreams, and fantasies and distinguish these from physical real­
ity. She was spontaneous and rarely resorted to cliches that 
might have raised doubts about her genuine awareness of her 
inner world. Nevertheless, her mentalizing capacity was in some 
important respects flawed, and certain changes that took place 
in the course of therapy resembled those described in empirical 
studies of the development of the psychic reality of the child 
between the ages of 3 and 5 years. 
While Rebecca would probably have been able to conceive of a 
sponge that looks like a rock, when it came to accepting that 
her analyst was both a therapist and someone who looked like 
a daddy, she retreated from the kind of integration of appear­
ance and reality required by her experience of the transference. 
Rebecca could1 pretend that her analyst was pretend Rebecca's 
father and know it was not real. What real Rebecca did not know 
while playing was that she was playing with an analyst who only 
felt like a father. For her, the analyst looking and acting like a 
father was, for that moment, the reality. To question this spoiled 
the game and led to a devastating sense of loss. This happened 
through the developmental analogue of the preference for psy­
chic reality over factual reality described by Freud (1912-13) as 
a "Playing with Reality" / 279 
being characteristic of neurotics. Rebecca was developmentally 
ready to see the distinction and could use it in circumstances 
that were less emotionally salient, but she was prevented from 
fully experiencing it in this context by her intense desire for a 
real father, for the actualization of the father figure in the 
transference. At the moment she felt it, the transference was, for 
Rebecca, and probably for all children at her stage of develop­
ment, not a fantasy, but a subjective experience as real as that of 
a physical object. This can, of course, be equally true for many 
patients at certain times in their analysis, but Rebecca's analy­
sis was, at least initially, completely dominated by the mode of 
psychic equivalence, where there was no "potential space" (Win­
nicott 1971) in which the narrator's experience of the analyst as 
a father could be looked at and understood. Only by playing with 
reality in analysis, perrnitting Rebecca to observe the analyst's 
mental representation of her playing, was she able to develop a 
tentatively held image of her own desires for a father and see 
these as wishes that were part of phantasy rather than the 
outside world. The wishes could' then be brought into Rebecca's 
thinking about external reality. 
We suggest that Rebecca could not afford to "play" that she 
had a father because her mother reacted too severely to this 
fantasy. The reflection in herself of Rebecca's sadness about her 
absent father was too real. This may have been the principal 
reason for Rebecca's initial inability to play that she had a father 
and for the compulsive, addictive quality of this play when it 
became possible. Normally the young child tends to adopt a 
defensive strategy of dealing with unacceptable ideas in the 
realm of pretense and phantasy, where they can be played with, 
all connections to actuality removed. Perhaps this is a way in 
which play can be said to have a vital role in the development of 
mastery (Freud 1920g)—the reworking of a passive experience 
into an active one (Drucker 1975). In "pretend" mode ideas 
cannot threaten; they have lost their equivalence to what is real. 
However, Rebecca's attempt to decouple phantasy from reality, 
inner from outer, may have been undermined not just by the 
intensity of her desires—and her unwillingness to give up the 
idea of their actuality, but also by her, mother's inability to take 
Rebecca's ideas and feelings into her subjective reality.

280 / Developmental Perspectives 
Her mother could not tolerate a genuine awareness of Re­
becca's frustration and unhappiness because she herself also 
tended to be stuck (in this area) in a mode of psychic equiva­
lence. The phantasy father, Rebecca's exploration of the idea of a 
father, was too real and intolerable for her mother. The idea 
could not be played with or genuinely entertained as a wish. 
Rebecca arrived at the analytic situation troubled by the "real-
ness" of her psychic reality. Her normal developmental progres­
sion was arrested because the intensity of her feelings forced an 
idea from the pretend but unreal world of fantasy into the part of 
her mind where mental contents corresponded to physical reali­
ties. In these circumstances, we suggest, the pretend mode may 
be given up by the child in this area, and the idea is forced into 
the mode of psychic equivalence: It becomes as "real" for the 
child as it threatened to be for the mother. 
The young child, attempting to make the developmental step 
between a nonrepresentational and a representational mode of 
psychic reality, is in a highly vulnerable state. The integration of 
the pretend (representational but unreal) and the actual (non-
representational but real) confronts the child with particular 
difficulties when a representation, made actual, signals danger. 
While the worlds of pretend and reality are separate, the child's 
psychic reality can include fantasy representations that would 
be highly conflictual if their truth or falsity were to be examined 
in conjunction with the world outside. The fantasy of the sexual 
possession of the parent of the opposite sex is safe as long as it is 
held in the pretend mode of psychic reality, where concerns with 
possibility or impossibility, or relation to physical reality, are 
absent. Pretend desire, even if conscious, arouses no conflict. 
Only when the representational mode of pretense comes gra­
dually to be integrated with the experience of psychic reality 
corresponding to external reality—where the thought suddenly 
becomes real—do terrifying conflicts arise through the increas­
ingly clear image of the feelings of the other, in seeing the child's 
wish. Resolution of this dilemma normally arises through the 
radical restriction of such dangerous fantasies, through the 
establishment of the repression barrier, first to a pretend mode 
and later to an unconscious mode of thought. "Playing with Reality" / 281 
Internal and external circumstances can conspire to make 
such a progression difficult, as was the case for Rebecca. Before 
the two modes of functioning are fully integrated, representa­
tions from the pretend mode may become so intensively and 
actively stimulated that they encroach upon the child's mental 
world in its mode of psychic equivalence. The absence and 
unknowability of Rebecca's father may have been such a cir­
cumstance. Her belief that her charismatic grandfather was 
her father acquired the qualities of a fact, making his death a 
trauma of far greater intensity than it might otherwise have 
been. The penetration of the psychic barrier between real and 
pretend, the feeling of actualization that comes to characterize 
worrying thoughts, the difficulty in discriminating between pos­
sibility and certainty, all serve to magnify the small child's 
anxiety. The acknowledgment of the reality of these experiences 
for the child is the only therapeutic starting point and a major 
source of reassurance as it begins the move toward a representa­
tional level. 
Because Rebecca had no "other" to pretend and reflect with, 
she was, in a sense, obliged to keep an idea in her mind (the 
image of her father) that was isomorphic with reality. Rebecca 
must have found some comfort in the solution that "believing is 
having." The hurt and shame of being fatherless could not be 
tolerated and was avoided by retaining this "psychotic island" 
(Rosenfeld 1971) within her subjective experience. According to 
Rosenfeld's notion, there is a part of the patient's thinking where 
the equivalence of subjective experience and physical reality has 
been retained, but in such a way that subjective experience is 
projected onto and distorts actual reality, which then, in turn, 
becomes a source of terrifying anxiety. 
Rebecca's metaphor of the snake, which placed her worries 
outside herself, was a characteristic example of the thought as a 
concrete physical object. She needed the adult to soften her 
ideas so that she could herself shape them and create a psychic 
world that was no longer either pure fantasy or hard reality, but 
which could cover her entire range of experiences, just as she 
wished that the "world blanket" would cover all the objects in 
her internal world. Many might see the image of the snake as a

unknowability of Rebecca's father may have been such a cir­
cumstance. Her belief that her charismatic grandfather was 
her father acquired the qualities of a fact, making his death a 
trauma of far greater intensity than it might otherwise have 
been. The penetration of the psychic barrier between real and 
pretend, the feeling of actualization that comes to characterize 
worrying thoughts, the difficulty in discriminating between pos­
sibility and certainty, all serve to magnify the small child's 
anxiety. The acknowledgment of the reality of these experiences 
for the child is the only therapeutic starting point and a major 
source of reassurance as it begins the move toward a representa­
tional level. 
Because Rebecca had no "other" to pretend and reflect with, 
she was, in a sense, obliged to keep an idea in her mind (the 
image of her father) that was isomorphic with reality. Rebecca 
must have found some comfort in the solution that "believing is 
having." The hurt and shame of being fatherless could not be 
tolerated and was avoided by retaining this "psychotic island" 
(Rosenfeld 1971) within her subjective experience. According to 
Rosenfeld's notion, there is a part of the patient's thinking where 
the equivalence of subjective experience and physical reality has 
been retained, but in such a way that subjective experience is 
projected onto and distorts actual reality, which then, in turn, 
becomes a source of terrifying anxiety. 
Rebecca's metaphor of the snake, which placed her worries 
outside herself, was a characteristic example of the thought as a 
concrete physical object. She needed the adult to soften her 
ideas so that she could herself shape them and create a psychic 
world that was no longer either pure fantasy or hard reality, but 
which could cover her entire range of experiences, just as she 
wished that the "world blanket" would cover all the objects in 
her internal world. Many might see the image of the snake as a 

282 / Developmental Perspectives 
phallic, dangerous, but highly prized possession, perhaps repre­
senting the analysis or just the devoted attention of a male adult. 
The "world blanket" also may have been a protection against 
anxiety, which increased as her sexual wishes and hopes be­
came more transparent. This view of the material is quite com­
patible with the perspective we offer, in that we suggest that the 
reason the sexual wishes were so worrying was that they were 
experienced in the mode of psychic equivalence. They felt too real 
to be fantasies. It needed the analyst to recognize that they could 
be pretend and yet feel real. 
As always, then, there was a price to pay, and the comfort 
of keeping an idea of her father alive could only be short-lived. 
Her unconscious phantasies of sexual destructiveness and anni­
hilation came with this idea, entering into the real world of 
psychic equivalence, making them even more real and terrifying. 
All children have such fantasies, but normally the ideas may be 
"metabolized" (to borrow Bion's terminology) through play, 
licensed and supported by the parents, and without conse­
quence. A father sits down during a mock battle, only to be told, 
"You are the monster—you'have to stand up so that I can kill 
you!" If the father dutifully stands up, he is helping his child to 
metabolize and work through the murderous phantasy. If he 
stays sitting down—or especially if he responds to the phantasy 
with disapproval, anger, sadness, or fear, reinforcing the child's 
sense that it might become too real—the murderous thoughts 
remain unmetabolized. They may pass back from the pretend 
mode to the mode of psychic equivalence, and an opportunity for 
the child to see his idea as an idea is lost. Rebecca's mother's 
depression following the death of her own father may well have 
made it intolerable for her to contemplate Rebecca's feelings of 
loss at the time that she felt them, and her reaction of real 
sadness reinstated a mode of psychic equivalence in relation to 
those thoughts. 
The acute separation anxiety that brought Rebecca to analy­
sis in the first place may also be understood as indicating a lack 
of continuity in the experience of the psychological self. In pre­
vious chapters we have described (see also Fonagy, Moran, and 
Target 1993: Fonagy and Target 1995) a dialectical theory of 
early self-development, drawing on work by Winnicott and Bion, "Playing with Reality" / 283 
according to which the infant finds an image of himself, in his 
mother's mind, as an individual with thoughts and feelings. 
Winnicott (e.g., 1967) stressed that it is vital for the infant to see 
a reflection of his own state (albeit processed to make it more 
containable—Bion 1962a, 1962b), not of the mother's own fixed 
preoccupations or defensive maneuvers, when he looks to her for 
images of himself. Rebecca's mother was, apparently, depressed 
and angry when Rebecca was born. The baby had not been 
planned, and the father abandoned the mother in response to 
news of the pregnancy. Rebecca's mother felt the baby to be a 
disastrous threat to her independence, destroying her hopes for 
the future. We suggest that the infant Rebecca, in searching for 
her mother's picture of her and her states of mind, may have 
been confronted with the picture of a wrecker,, a ruthless invader 
who steals what is most precious: a pirate, in Rebecca's later 
frightened image. This idea of the pirate, like the ideas about her 
father's disappearance, became all too real for Rebecca by be­
coming part of the world of "psychic equivalence" rather than of 
play and phantasy. 
Rebecca may have clung to her mother not only because of 
the fear of the destructiveness felt to threaten both of them, but 
also because the only time Rebecca could get away from the 
negative "pirate" image of herself, internalized from the early 
mother, was, paradoxically, when she was with her real, external 
mother of the present. When with her mother, she could exter­
nalize the alien, frightening image of the pirate and retain a 
clearer, uncontaminated image of herself. When she battled with 
her mother, as she frequently did, this introjected image no 
longer obscured Rebecca's self-representation, and she felt obvi­
ous relief. The price of this strategy was that Rebecca needed to 
stay physically close to the object if she was to avoid the image of 
the pirate emerging as the core experience of herself, as it did in 
her daytime terrors and nightmares. 
So Rebecca's thoughts, about the dangerousness of her own 
and her mother's aggression and sexuality, seem partly to have 
blocked the development and integration of the girl's psychic 
reality and forced her to retain a part of her mind in which 
thought and actuality were treated as the same. This protected 
her from anxiety related to her mother's actual angry and reject-

ing response to her, but it deprived her of another form of 
protection, which would have followed integration of the two 
modes of thinking. With this integrationTfhe capacity to mental­
ize, to see ideas as merely ideas and not facts, to play with 
different points of view, there comes the capacity to test ideas 
against reality and therefore to moderate their impact. Insulated 
from knowledge of what could or could not "really" happen in 
relation to her anxiety-provoking ideas, Rebecca's terror of her 
thoughts and feelings in this area was magnified as these repeat­
edly surfaced, to be experienced as "real." 
The same phenomenon emerged in the transference, where 
the analyst could be either Rebecca's analyst or her father, but 
never the analyst representing the father. When he drew her 
attention to the dual reality that he looked like a Daddy but was 
actually a therapist, Rebecca responded by making the father 
more real—someone she had really met who really looked like the 
analyst. However, we can also see how important it was that the 
analyst could play with Rebecca's ideas and recognize that they 
were part of her internal world and not external reality. The loss 
involved in giving up the fulfillment of a wish was balanced, over 
the course of the analysis, by the reassurance of finding that her 
fears were fears rather than facts and that, although they could 
not be mastered by Rebecca alone, they could be played with and 
made safer in the "potential space" between two minds. Psycho­
analysis is in many respects a "pretend" experience. Play is 
essential to it, just as it is essential to our psychoanalytic model 
of the developing mind. Analyst and patient discuss fantasies, 
feelings, and ideas that they "know" at the same time to be false. 
Klauber (1987) wrote beautifully about this in his paper on 
transference as an illusion. This refocusing of the role of the 
analyst highlights the role played by the adult in the child's 
construction of his own mind and the development of a represen­
tation of it (effectively a metarepresentation). 
Rebecca was able to arrive at an integration represented 
by the analyst/father, real as a subjective experience but at 
the same time known to be a mere idea. In her role play, Rebecca 
moved the experience of her thoughts and feelings to a de­
velopmentally higher level, where these became increasingly 
differentiated. She repeatedly explored the boundaries of her "Playing with Reality" / 285 
self-experience, looking at herself from within (as pretend Re­
becca} and without (as Hannah) while also constantly monitoring 
whether she was recognized and understood by the other in the 
specific role that she herself assigned. Her play allowed her to 
adopt numerous perspectives, each one offering a test of her 
imagined place in relation to the object, each self-representation 
clearly separate and distinct from the internal picture of the 
object. She adopted the point of view of the third, observing a 
relationship between herself and the object and thus greatly 
strengthening the coherence and stability of her representation 
of herself as she related to others. In this way, she could relin­
quish the wish reinforced by psychic equivalence and exchange 
it for the defenses that mentalizing offers to the child. This 
happens gradually, in ordinary family life or in analysis, not 
just by addressing particular thoughts but also by addressing 
thoughts in general. In Rebecca's game, what was important was 
not simply playing with the idea of an absent father, but setting 
up a structure where the thoughts and feelings of each person 
could be imagined and considered. In time, and with much 
analytic work she became far clearer about the analyst's role. 
When the analyst mistakenly addressed her shadow game with 
the daddy giraffe as a consolation for her Oliver Twist feelings of 
abandonment, she was able to set the analyst right and indicate 
that she knew that the experience that it created was like a 
shadow—real yet at the same time illusory. 
The background to Rebecca's problems was a state of confu­
sion and ignorance about the actual circumstances of her fam­
ily, resulting from the mother's unwillingness to contemplate 
them, which made thinking about the possible feelings of those 
around her more frightening than usual and made it impossible 
for her to work her anxieties out without help. In the absence of 
an adult at home who could help her bridge the gap between 
inner and outer, she needed another adult, the analyst, to pro­
vide the necessary frame for play and, reflection. 
Thus the analyst's play with the child has an important 
development—enhancing function. Not only is it his sole route to 
engaging the child's representational system, but it is also a 
developmental opportunity for the child to gain better under­
standing of the nature of mental states. In Rebecca's play, all the

characters (eight in all) felt, thought, believed and wished, and 
their shared world—the consulting-room—brought into sharp 
contrast their different perceptions, their sometimes painfully 
incongruent experiences of the world. Naturally their (interper­
sonal and intrapsychic) conflicts, worries, relationships provided 
a rich source of material for interpretation as well as insight into 
Rebecca's perceptions and feelings about the transference as 
well as the general state of her psychic functioning. But there 
was something else. Rebecca used her play with the analyst to 
test out her ideas about how her own mind and the minds of 
others functioned. When she repeated again and again the sce­
nario where the analyst (as Hannah's father) was startled to find 
Rebecca where Hannah had been expected, she not only enjoyed 
the fantasy of a surprise reunion with her father, or the reversal 
of the normal dominance of grown-up over child, but she also 
practiced, in a safer context than her home environment nor­

and rejoiced in her awareness of the reestablishment of her 
existence in the adult's mind. 
A DEVELOPMENTAL MODEL OF EARLY OBJECT 
RELATIONSHIPS AND THE EVOLUTION 
OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
As described above, the caregiver produces intentionality 
through complex linguistic and interactional processes, prima­
rily through behaving toward the baby and child in such a way 
that it leads him eventually to postulate that his own behavior 
may be best understood in terms of ideas and beliefs, feelings 
and wishes that determine his actions and the reactions of 
others to him. Unconsciously and pervasively, with her behavior 
the caregiver ascribes a mental state to the child that is ulti­
mately perceived by the child and internalized, permitting the 
development of a core sense of mental selfhood. Prototypically in 
playfulness, the adult adopts the child's mental stance and re­
presents it to him in relation to a third object,1 held symbolically 
in mind by both. We assume that this, by and large, is a 
ii "Playing with Reality" / 287 
mundane process, in the sense of happening every day through­
out early life, preconscious to both infant and caregiver, inacces­
sible to reflection or modification. Caregivers, however, differ in 
their ways of carrying out this most natural of human functions. 
Some may be alert to the earliest suggestions of intentionality, 
others may need stronger indications before perceiving the 
child's mental state and responding to it. Using Vygotsky's 
(1966) framework, we may conceive of this as the strength of the 
scaffolding provided for the "artificial development" of the child's 
understanding of his own mind. We may assume, as do most 
cognitivists working in this area, that the development of a 
theory of mind is canalized, in Waddington's (1966) use of the 
term, but the canal is dug not by biology, but by infant-parent 
interaction. 
We suggest that the symbiotic relation of caregiver and infant 
structures the emergence of the psychological self, the "I" of 
intentional ascriptions. Knowledge of minds and the intentional 
stance arise out of a phase when the mental worlds of child and 
caregiver overlap. This intersubjective state does not necessarily 
imply the experience or even phantasy of fusion between the 
child and caregiver, yet both the child and the mother are in a 
state of primary preoccupation, building intimate knowledge of 
the other parallel to their knowledge of themselves. The develop­
ing child's perception of mental states in himself and others thus 
depends on his sense of the psychic reality of his caregiver. 
Understanding the nature of the mental world cannot be done 
alone—it requires understanding of the self in the eye of the 
other. 
We suggest that where the parent is unable to incorporate 
and think about a piece of reality and cannot then enable the 
child to do so safely through playing with the frightening ideas, 
this reality remains to be experienced in the mode of psychic 
equivalence. Neither child nor parent can "metabolize" the 
thoughts, and the "unthinkable" thoughts are passed on from 
one generation to the next. On an everyday scale, Rebecca's 
mother could not help her with the unacceptable reality of her 
fatherless situation. On a massive scale, traumas such as Holo­
caust experiences may be passed on, or not, depending on the 
parents' capacity to allow the trauma to be part of shared reality.

which can be thought and talked about, not only relived as a 
continuing and fixed reality. 
Once the child can mentalize, he has available a crucial 
attenuating function for psychic experience. He is able to ma­
nipulate mental representations to defensively bar or modify 
perceptions of reality. The neurotic child fails to achieve a full 
integration of the "actual" and "pretend" modes into a represen­
tational framework, and certain ideas retain the immediacy 
of external reality. Before the integration of the two modes is 
achieved, the child is vulnerable to all kinds of appearances, 
particularly in relation to adults around them. By mentalizing, 
attributing ideas and feelings to himself and to others, the child 
makes his human world more explicable to himself. Until he is 
able to step beyond appearance and grasp the distinction be­
tween this and the mental state that might underpin it, he 
remains vulnerable to the immediate emotional reaction of his 
object. Inconsistency or hostility in the object's behavior may 
then be taken at face value as showing something bad about 
him. In contrast, if the child is able to attribute a withdrawn, 
unhappy mother's apparently rejecting behavior to her emo­
tional state—of depression, or anger about some external cir­
cumstances—rather than to himself as bad and unstimulating, 
the child may be protected from lasting injury to his view of 
himself. 
Our acceptance of a dialectical perspective of self-develop­
ment shifts the traditional psychoanalytic emphasis from the 
internalization of the containing object to the internalization of 
the thinking self from within the containing object. This is what 
makes such concepts as thinking inherently intersubjective. 
Shared experience is part of the "very logic" (Sellars 1963, p. 
189) of mental-state concepts. All analytic work with young 
children contains an element of this developmental process, and 
some patients' treatment may be almost entirely focused on the 
elaboration of the self as a mental or psychological entity. The 
reflective aspect of the analytic process is understanding and not 
simply empathy (the accurate mirroring of mental state). In 
order to move the child from the mode of psychic equivalence to 
the mentalizing mode, analytic reflection, of whatever orienta­
tion, cannot just "copy" the child's internal state—it has to move "Playing with Reality" / 289 
beyond it and go a step further, offering a different, yet experien-
tially appropriate, re-presentation. The analyst's mind acts as 
scaffolding (Vygotsky 1966) designed to enhance the develop­
ment of representation in the child's psychic reality by being 
constantly one step ahead of the child's experience of his mental 
self. Thus child psychoanalysis is more than just the removal of 
obstacles to mentalization. It is the exercise of a developmental 
universal in pure form. The analyst must begin by acknowledg­
ing the compelling reality of the child's experience, entering into 
the pretend world, and only gradually showing him, through 
contact with his mental experience, that it is a set of representa­
tions that can be shared, played with, and changed.

which can be thought and talked about, not only relived as a 
continuing and fixed reality. 
Once the child can mentalize, he has available a crucial 
attenuating function for psychic experience. He is able to ma­
nipulate mental representations to defensively bar or modify 
perceptions of reality. The neurotic child fails to achieve a full 
integration of the "actual" and "pretend" modes into a represen­
tational framework, and certain ideas retain the immediacy 
of external reality. Before the integration of the two modes is 
achieved, the child is vulnerable to all kinds of appearances, 
particularly in relation to adults around them. By mentalizing, 
attributing ideas and feelings to himself and to others, the child 
makes his human world more explicable to himself. Until he is 
able to step beyond appearance and grasp the distinction be­
tween this and the mental state that might underpin it, he 
remains vulnerable to the immediate emotional reaction of his 
object. Inconsistency or hostility in the object's behavior may 
then be taken at face value as showing something bad about 
him. In contrast, if the child is able to attribute a withdrawn, 
unhappy mother's apparently rejecting behavior to her emo­
tional state—of depression, or anger about some external cir­
cumstances—rather than to himself as bad and unstimulating, 
the child may be protected from lasting injury to his view of 
himself. 
Our acceptance of a dialectical perspective of self-develop­
ment shifts the traditional psychoanalytic emphasis from the 
internalization of the containing object to the internalization of 
the thinking self from within the containing object. This is what 
makes such concepts as thinking inherently intersubjective. 
Shared experience is part of the "very logic" (Sellars 1963, p. 
189) of mental-state concepts. All analytic work with young 
children contains an element of this developmental process, and 
some patients' treatment may be almost entirely focused on the 
elaboration of the self as a mental or psychological entity. The 
reflective aspect of the analytic process is understanding and not 
simply empathy (the accurate mirroring of mental state). In

Marked Affect-Mirroring 
and the Development 
of Affect-Regulative Use 
of Pretend Play 
Chapter 6 proposed a psychoanalytic model for the development 
of full subjectivity, closely linked to the quality of interaction 
between parent and child. A clinical illustration was offered to 
show that, for internal reality to be experienced as truly repre­
sentational rather than as either totally real or totally unreal, the 
object's mirroring of the child's internal reality, preferably in a 
playful manner, was a prerequisite. In this chapter, the psycho­
logical underpinnings of the processes involved in playful mirror­
ing interactions between child and caregiver are elaborated in 
the context of a further case report. It is argued that the specific 
features of interactions that effect a change in the quality of 
internal representation involve the caregiver creating "marked 
externalizations" of the child's internal states with the key quali­
ties of separating or decoupling internal experience from physical 
reality, offering a sense of control over the experience and poten­
tially modifying the content of the experience in the direction of 
increased pleasure or wish fulfillment. Marked parental mirror­
ing in the context of pretend play or empathic pro-social actions 
offer early opportunities for the infant to encode features of 
markedness of expressions (signaling "nonconsequentiality" and 
decoupling from physical reality), content modifications (leading 
to reduction of unpleasure and wish fulfillment), and the en-

hancement of agentive aspects (which exert control and mastery 
over affective experience). Such interactions may provide impor­
tant experiential preconditions that facilitate the emergence of 
the active use of these features for emotional self-regulation by 
the infants themselves. 
We argue that the absence of parental mirroring can lead to a 
developmental arrest at the level of psychic equivalence. The 
absence of "markedness" in the caregiver's response can lead to 
affective dysregulation, which ultimately results in a fear of 
extemalization on the part of the child: he becomes reluctant to 
enter social interactions where mirroring would be expected from 
the caregiver. This discourages the child from seeking social 
experiences that might correct this developmental deviation. We 
present a case of a 4-year-old child where therapeutic interven­
tion appeared to have the power to supplement the child's psy­
chosocial deprivation. A cognitive analysis of the treatment is 
used as a springboard for understanding a facet of what might 
be effective in the psychoanalytic therapeutic process for adoles­
cents and adults as well. 
INTRODUCTION 
In previous chapters we have proposed two closely related devel­
opmental theories about the relationship between understanding 
the representational nature of minds and affect regulation— 
the theory of psychic equivalence and the pretend mode of 
mentalizing on the one hand (chapter 6), and the social biofeed­
back theory of parental affect-mirroring on the other (chapter 4). 
From a historical point of view, both of these theories can be seen 
as present-day elaborations within the framework of theory-of-
mind development of Freud's original proposals about the nature 
of psychic reality (Freud 1900a, 1950 [1895]) and about the role 
of pretend play in affective life (Freud 1920g). 
The first theory, put forward in chapter 6, distinguishes be­
tween two basic types of representational functioning: the 
"psychic equivalence" and the "pretend" modes of representing 
internal experience, which antedate the full development of the Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 293 
capacity for mentalization (see also Fonagy 1995b; Fonagy and 
Target 1996; Target and Fonagy 1996). "Psychic equivalence" 
refers to the more primitive level of mental functioning, where 
internal mind states such as thoughts, fantasies, and feelings 
are confused with and experienced as reality and not as repre­
sentations of reality. In contrast, the "pretend" mode of mental­
izing involves an awareness of the representational nature of 
internal mind states: by separating or "decoupling" (Leslie 1987) 
the mental representations from reality, the child can differenti­
ate thoughts and fantasies from actual reality, although on his 
own he can create no useful connection between this representa­
tion and physical reality. The theory holds that the development 
of mentalization is a function of the quality of early attachment 
experiences, as the integration of the "pretend" and "equiva­
lence" modes occurs principally in the course of repeated experi­
ences of interactions with a playful caregiver who reflects the 
child's feelings and thoughts in a "marked" manner. The theory 
also considers the role that these two levels of mental function­
ing play in the development of normal and psychopathological 
forms of affect regulation and self-organization and uses the 
Gergely-Watson social biofeedback model of the development of 
emotional self-awareness (see chapter 4). 
The second theory, originally developed by Gergely and Wat­
son (1996) and described here in chapter 4, proposes a specific, 
contingency-based psychological mechanism (the "social bio­
feedback model of parental affect-mirroring") that explains how 
empathic affect-regulative mirroring interactions within the at­
tachment context contribute ontogenetically to the establish­
ment of second-order representations of affect states and their 
adaptive use in more mature forms of affective self-regulation. 
The theory also outlines specific hypotheses about how a lack or 
deviant forms of early affect-regulative mirroring interactions by 
attachment figures may be involved in the etiology of affective 
and dissociative disorders and pathologies of the self (see chap­
ters 4 and 5). 
In this chapter, we present a clinical case that illustrates the 
explanatory relevance of these two theories for our understand­
ing of the ontogenesis of certain pathologies of the self that 
involve deficits in mentalization and affect regulation. The case

vignette also sheds some light on how these theories can lead to 
an understanding of the psychological processes through which 
psychotherapeutic interventions may induce corrective change 
in representational functioning in such patients. Before turning 
to the case material, however, we shall first take a closer look at 
an important key concept that plays a crucial role in both of our 
theories and that also looms large in the case study to be 
discussed: namely, the concept of "marked externalizations" of 
affectively charged internal mental contents. We briefly discuss 
the characteristics and functional properties of the construct 
and identify its different forms—such as pretend play, fiction, 
art, fantasy, daydreaming, or imagination—encountered in ma­
ture representational functioning. Finally, we discuss the re­
presentational and experiential prerequisites for the unfolding 
ability to use marked externalizations for affective self-regulation 
and outline our central developmental hypotheses about the role 
that contingent affect-regulative mirroring interactions play in 
the development of this ability. 
"MARKED EXTERNALIZATIONS" 
AND AFFECTIVE SELF-REGULATION 
Humans have evolved a unique mental capacity for representing 
the intentionality—that is, "aboutness"—of symbols, such as 
language, pictorial representations, conventional gestures, and 
so on. This ability is widely used by humans to externalize their 
mental contents (such as their beliefs, desires, intentions, and 
emotions) in order to communicate with each other—that is, to 
exchange culturally relevant information with other members 
of their species that fosters survival. However, throughout 
this book we have emphasized that apart from communicating 
knowledge, this vital representational ability also serves a rather 
different evolutionary function: people often externalize their 
afiectively charged mental contents in order to regulate—main­
tain, modify, reduce, or intensify—their affective states. Evi­
dently, one can externalize both positive and negative affective 
impulses in the service of emotion regulation (cf. Stern 1985). '. Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 295 
Nonetheless, historically at least, clinicians have been particu­
larly interested in their patients' tendency to use different forms 
of externalizations to "get rid of or modify their negative affect 
states. These states could; arise from painful memories of trau­
matic life events, from—conscious or unconscious—mental rep­
resentations of (real or/fantasized) interpersonal conflicts and 
interactions, or from socially unacceptable desires that generate 
painful feelings of anxiety, helplessness, guilt, shame, anger, 
fear, rage, and so on. / 
The clinical meaning of the term "externalization," however, is 
rather broad, as it includes phenomena such as projection, 
projective identification, enactment, and acting out. In all these 
instances, the internal experience that is being externalized 
for affect-regulative purposes appears to be perceived by the 
individual as being part of actual external reality and as not 
belonging to the self. We would like to distinguish cases of 
externalizations that involve a defensive distortion of reality per­
ception from cases such as pretend play, symbolic drawing and 
painting, theater and drama, listening to fairy tales, creating art, 
fantasizing, or daydreaming, where the affect-regulative function 
of externalization is fulfilled without undermining reality testing. 
In such cases the externalized affective content is clearly under­
stood to be "not for real": it' is conceptualized as being "de­
coupled" from reality (Leslie 1987), as being (only) a representation 
of reality (Perner 1991) that belongs to a fictional world instead of 
the real one. We use the terms "marked externalizations" and 
"symbolic externalizations" to refer only to the latter types of 
expressions of internal contents, where the subject always main­
tains some level of awareness and understanding of the repre­
sentational nature of the externalized symbolic form. 
When interpreting such externalized expressions, their repre­
sentation needs to become somehow "tagged" or "marked" as 
being only a "representation" of reality in order to avoid confu­
sion with actual reality. Earlier we.have argued that in the cases 
of pretend play as well as of the affect-reflective parental mirror­
ing displays discussed in chapters 4 and 6, the negative 
emotional contents of the child's mind are externalized in a 
perceptually clearly "marked" form that signals that the exter­
nalization is "not for real." Take the case of pretend play: here

emotional contents of the child's mind are externalized in a 
perceptually clearly "marked" form that signals that the exter­

markedness is conveyed by a series of salient perceptual fea­
tures that distinguish a pretend action or pretend emotion 
expression from a realistic one. Knowing looks, slightly tilted 
head, high pitch and slowed down, exaggerated intonation con­
tour, schematic, abbreviated, or only partial execution of action 
schemes, and the use of invisible imaginary objects all clearly 
and saliently mark for the child that the pretend expression is 
categorically different from its realistic equivalent—that it is "not 
for real." We have argued (see chapter 4) that in the case of 
adaptive parental affect-mirroring interactions, the affect-reflec­
tive emotion display is also modified by the same kinds of 
transformations of the corresponding realistic emotion display 
resulting in a saliently different, marked form of emotion expres­
sion. As a result, while the affective content of the mirroring 
display will be recognized by the child, it will not be attributed to 
the parent as her real emotion: it will be interpreted as "not for 
real." This reality-decoupled interpretation is further reinforced 
by the experienced "nonconsequentialUy" of marked expressions 
and actions, both in pretense and in empathic mirroring: the 
normally experienced typical consequences that would be 
expected to follow the realistic, unmarked form of the same 
expression do not ensue when the perceived display or action is 
performed in a "marked" pretend mode. We have hypothesized 
(see chapter 4 and Gergely and Watson 1996) that the perception 
of markedness activates the young child's metarepresentational 
system (Leslie 1987), which allows for the "decoupling" of the 
expression from its referents in actual reality. The ensuing un­
derstanding of the marked pretense or affect-mirroring display 
as referring to a fictional world and, as such, as having no 
realistic consequences contributes crucially to affect regulation. 
The child feels safe in the "decoupled," fictional world of repre­
sentational reenactment in which no realistic negative outcomes 
can occur (Gergely and Watson 1996). 
Freud's (1920g) famous analysis of the "fort-da" pretend game 
of his 18-month-old grandson highlights some further important 
features of the use of marked externalizations that foster affec­
tive coping with negative affect. He. observed his grandson play­
ing out repeatedly the very same event, which involved throwing 
a bobbin of thread over the curtain of his crib, saying "fort" 
it Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 297 
[away] as the object disappeared from sight and then retrieving 
it, saying "da" [back]. According to Freud's interpretation, in the 
first event of the pretend episode {"fort") the child was externaliz­
ing the separations from his mother that inevitably occurred in 
the course of their daily lives. The second part of the sequence 
{"da"), however, corresponded to a wishful imaginary undoing of 
these painful separations. The externalized pretend version dif­
fered from the internally represented traumatic event encoded in 
memory in that during the reenactment the child was an active 
agent who was in control over the unfolding of the pretend 
episode, whereas during the actual event as represented in his 
memory he was a helpless subject, passively experiencing the 
traumatizing separation event. This resulted in an emotionally 
corrective experience insofar as the perception of the qualita­
tively transformed, marked externalization of the originally trau­
matic event generates positive affects of agency and reunion that 
counteract the negative emotions associated with the original 
event memory. This type of self-controlled modified reenactment 
within the safe "pretend mode" of a fictional representational 
world provides, therefore, an effective way of helping to cope with 
the painful memory of the traumatic event. 
Up to now we have discussed two types of phenomena exem­
plifying what we called "marked externalizations": empathic 
parental affect-mirroring and pretend play. In both cases the 
marked expressions of the child's internal affective contents are, 
indeed, "externalized": they are.perceived by the child as external 
events "out there" in the world. (The same is true, of course, in 
the case of "symbolic externalizations" using external media of 
expression such as drawings, paintings, sculptures, or protago­
nists in a play.) However, there are also other ways of expressing 
one's internal affective contents for self-regulative purposes that 
involve purely mentally generated subjective "internal events" 
that are perceived only introspectively, as in daydreaming, fanta­
sizing, and imagination. (Pretend play and discussions with an 
imaginary partner exemplify a truly "mixed" form of externaliza­
tion and internal imagery.) 
In chapter 11 on mentalized affectivity dealing with forms of 
affect regulation in adult patients, we develop the concept of 
"inward expression of affects" that involves self-reflective and

within the safe "pretend mode" of a fictional representational 
world provides, therefore, an effective way of helping to cope with 
the painful memory of the traumatic event. 
Up to now we have discussed two types of phenomena exem­
plifying what we called "marked externalizations": empathic 
parental affect-mirroring and pretend play. In both cases the 
marked expressions of the child's internal affective contents are, 
indeed, "externalized": they are.perceived by the child as external 
events "out there" in the world. (The same is true, of course, in 
the case of "symbolic externalizations" using external media of 
expression such as drawings, paintings, sculptures, or protago­
nists in a play.) However, there are also other ways of expressing 
one's internal affective contents for self-regulative purposes that 
involve purely mentally generated subjective "internal events" 
that are perceived only introspectively, as in daydreaming, fanta­
sizing, and imagination. (Pretend play and discussions with an 
imaginary partner exemplify a truly "mixed" form of externaliza­
tion and internal imagery.) 
In chapter 11 on mentalized affectivity dealing with forms of 
affect regulation in adult patients, we develop the concept of 
"inward expression of affects" that involves self-reflective and 

•ii* iggggsasy! 
298 / Developmental Perspectives Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 299 
introspective apprehension and awareness of one's own emo­
tions as those are expressed and represented to oneself in one's 
mind. We wish to argue that these "inner forms of self-reflective 
emotional experiences" belong to the same category of "marked" 
and "symbolic externalizations" as pretend play and empathic 
affect-mirroring, except for the fact that they use an internal— 
rather than external—medium of representation for the affect-
regulative expression of primary emotional experiences. The 
three features that we identified as contributing to the emotion­
ally corrective affect-regulative experience in marked externali­
zations—perceptual markedness, transformation of the role of 
the experiencer from passive subject into active agent, and con­
tent modification—can also be found in daydreaming, fantasy, 
and imagination. In fact, these "internal expressions" are also 
perceived (in the "mind's eye") as decoupled and representational 
in nature (markedness). As such, they are not confused with the 
actual emotional experience they inwardly express: the intro­
specting subject remains aware that these internafaffect expres­
sions are "not for real." In the same vein, inward expressions of 
emotionally charged event memories or fantasies can be actively 
controlled by the subject and their contents can be modified 
willfully, just as in the case of externally represented pretend 
play. 
From a developmental point of view, we hypothesize that 
marked externalizations of internal affective contents using an 
external medium of expression precede and pave the way for the 
development of forms of purely "inward expressions" of affect 
states in the service of affective self-regulation. In particular, it is 
noteworthy that in empathic parental affect-mirroring the act of 
externalization, the perceptual marking of the expression, and 
the partial modification of its content (as in the case of par­
tial mirroring or presenting "mixed emotions"—cf. Fonagy and 
Fonagy 1995) are all carried out by the mirroring adult, not by 
the infant. In this case, even the infant's sense of control and 
agency over the ensuing affect-regulative experience is generated 
automatically by the detection of the high degree of contingent 
relatedness between the baby's emotion expressions and the 
mirroring display. Therefore, we suggest that repeated experience 
with affect-regulative parental mirroring may provide infants with an early proto-form of marked externalizations at an age 
when they are as yet unable on their own to generate marked 
externalizations of their internal affective states. Thus, we believe 
that early opportunities to encode the markedness (signaling 
"nonconsequentiality" and decoupling from physical reality), the 
content modifications (leading to reduction of unpleasure and 
wish fulfillment), and the agentive aspects of parental mirroring 
displays (exerting control and mastery), together with the estab­
lishment of an association between these features and the 
ensuing affect-regulative experience, may provide important ex­
periential preconditions that facilitate the emergence of the active 
use of these features for emotional self-regulation by the infants 
themselves (as in pretend play or empathic pro-social actions 
appearing during the second year of life—see chapter 5). 
BIOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS 
OF THE AFFECT-REGULATIVE USE 
OF 'MARKED EXTERNALIZATIONS" 
From the representational point of view, all of these different— 
external and internal—forms of intentional self-expressions are 
metarepresentational in nature (Leslie 1987): they presuppose 
the availability of second-order representations (Dennett 1991; 
Dennett and Haugeland 1987) and the ability to "decouple" 
representations from reality (Leslie 1987, 1994). It is precisely 
for that reason that all these different forms of self-expressions 
of primary affective contents have the potential to be used for 
affective self-regulation: they can be experienced as "not for real" 
and as "nonconsequential," they provide an experience of safety 
and agency through the exertion of control, and they can gener­
ate corrective emotional "rewriting" of the negative affect memory 
by reexperiencing it in the marked "as-if" mode with a modified 
emotional content. 
From this view it follows that lacking second-order repre­
sentations to express internal affective states or lacking the 
metarepresentational capacity for referential decoupling can be 
expected to lead to an impoverished or nonexistent understand-

ing of intentional mental states—such as beliefs and desires—in 
the self and others. Such a primary deficit in theory of mind is 
the central feature of the debilitating condition of "mindblind-
ness" (Baron-Cohen 1995) that is characteristic of the disorder 
of childhood autism. A further predictable consequence that we 
wish to emphasize here is the lack of affective impulse control 
that is also highly typical of children with autism (see Hobson 
1993). The mental capacity to represent second-order represen­
tations and the related ability for referential decoupling may well 
turn out to be innate adaptations of the human mind (Fodor 
1992; Leslie 1987, 1994) that may be genetically impaired in 
childhood autism (Baron-Cohen et al. 1985; U. Frith 1989). 
However, even if the innate representational abilities neces­
sary for theory of mind were intact, our view is that certain types 
of dysfunctional early attachment environments may still result 
in a delayed or impoverished unfolding of the capacity to mental­
ize and/or in an acquired inhibition of its adaptive use for 
affective self-regulation. The case for a partially psychosocial 
model of the development of mentalization was made in chapter 
3 against the background of behavior-genetics research. There 
are several causal pathways through which deviant patterns of 
affective reactivity within the attachment context may lead to 
acquired deficits or developmental arrests in the unfolding of the 
functional use of early mentalization capacities. 
1. As hypothesized in chapter 4 (see also Gergely and Watson 
1996), through processes of social biofeedback, the infant-at­
tuned affect-mirroring environment may play an important role 
in establishing differentiated emotion representations through 
sensitization to emotion-specific patterns of internal-state cues. 
Furthermore, already during the preverbal stage adaptive affect-
mirroring may provide an early opportunity for establishing sec­
ond-order representations of primary affect states in the form of 
internalized representations of the marked mirroring displays 
that the infant comes to associate with the contingent internal 
affect state. Serious absence of such adaptive mirroring within 
the attachment context may, therefore, result in undifferentiated 
internal affective states, in impoverished awareness of emotional 
self-states, and in a tendency to confuse internal mind states Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 301 
with external reality. In other words, it may lead to a develop­
mental arrest at the level of "psychic equivalence" functioning 
where mental states and reality states remain confused and 
undifferentiated. 
2. Deviant mirroring exchanges that involve externalization of 
the infant's negative affects in the form of unmarked and realistic 
negative emotional reactions of the caregiver may lead to escala­
tion rather than modulation in the baby's negative affect state. 
This can establish a strong association between externalizations 
of negative internal contents and consequent dysequilibratiori 
and traumatization. Such an attachment environment can lead 
to a generalized avoidance of externalization as a means of self-
regulation, resulting in serious problems of impulse control. 
Furthermore, learning about the significance of perceptual cues 
of markedness as signaling referential decoupling and noncon-
sequentiality (i.e., acquiring the generalized communicative code 
of the pretend mode as indicating decoupling from reality) may 
become seriously delayed and impoverished. This would lead to a 
kind of "blindness to markedness," leading to a tendency to 
confuse pretense with reality. 
CLINICAL ILLUSTRATION: "MAT" 
Mat was brought to psychotherapy by his mother at 4.1 years of 
age with a series of behavioral and impulse-control problems. In 
his mother's view the most serious of these was failure to achieve 
toilet training by 4 years of age and the child's strong tendency to 
withhold his feces. Mat would obstipate for several days, would 
refuse to pass stool sitting on the toilet, and would oblige only if 
given a diaper. His mother also complained bitterly about Mat's 
uncontrollable emotional outbursts, frequent tantrums, and ex­
ternalizing violent behavior, both at the day-care center and at 
home. He often attacked smaller children at the day-care center, 
and he tortured his dog at home. He was also described as being 
obstinate, oppositional, and controlling ("giving orders") in his 
relationship with his mother. Mat's mother complained that he

and he tortured his dog at home. He was also described as being 
obstinate, oppositional, and controlling ("giving orders") in his 
relationship with his mother. Mat's mother complained that he 

302 / Developmental Perspectives 
was always asking "silly questions," which indicated serious 
castration anxiety, fantasies of physical intrusion, a phobic fear 
of babies, and an anxious interest in Cesarean births. 
Mat was a sickly child, with a history of illnesses (croup, a 
form of acute respiratory distress in children, pneumonia, aller­
gies) and hospitalizations. Following the pediatrician's advice, 
his mother stayed at home with him for the first three years of 
his life. He started to go to day-care only shortly before starting 
therapy and only for the morning hours. Mat showed an anx­
ious, ambivalent attachment attitude to his mother, clinging to 
her yet avoiding her gaze at the same time. He exhibited strong 
separation anxiety when left in day-care or when entering my 
room for therapy.1 
Mat's mother was a stiff, poker-faced woman with flat emo­
tionality who, nevertheless, did not hesitate to convey to me 
her exasperation, dissatisfaction, and often openly hostile feel­
ings (including anger and disgust) toward her son. She was 
rather dismissive of her child, whom she described as hopelessly 
spoiled and worthless. She was cold, intrusive, and overcon-
trolling in her interactions with Mat. She told me that she often 
"lost her head," shouting at him and beating him up. They lived 
in a closely symbiotic relationship that was dominated by aggres­
sion, rage, and often escalating negative affects. She struck me 
as being remarkably incapable of feeling empathy or attunement 
to her child's mental states, and as being in general quite unable 
to cope with her son's negative emotions. When faced with Mat's 
negative affective displays, she often reacted with complemen­
tary and realistic negative emotions herself, which typically led 
to an escalation of the child's negative state. 
A good example of this is her description of the recurring 
pattern of interaction in relation to Mat's willful refusal to open 
his bowels. When left in the nursery by his mother, Mat would 
refuse to pass stool, but when he was picked up by her in the 
afternoon, he could hardly withhold it on the way home. At home 
she would make him sit on the toilet and would sit down next to 
him herself. He would, however, refuse to pass stool (even 
though often in pain), and they would be sitting there like this

"for hours." She would get more and more angry with him and 
would plead with him to do it, reinforcing her pleas by threaten­
ing him with punishments and by making promises. Eventually, 
she would become deeply resentful, put diapers on Mat, place 
him in his crib, and attempt to leave the room. Facing the 
prospect of separation, however, Mat would then promptly soil 
his diapers. This would outrage his mother, because she would 
need to come back and change him. At this point she would 
often shout at him and hit him in her rage. 
I had the strong impression that Mat's mother was quite 
incapable of attending to and reading the dispositional displays 
that would allow her to identify her child's mental states. This 
was corroborated by the almost incredible story about Mat's 
older sister that Mat's mother shared with me in a rather casual 
tone of voice. Mat's sister was born practically blind, but this 
fact went unnoticed by her parents for several years. They found 
out about her condition only when at around the age of 3 or 4 
years she was taken to a routine medical checkup in her nursery 
school. Both parents had apparently missed the girl's almost 
total inability to see them clearly unless very close and directly 
facing them. This made me wonder about the seriousness of this 
dismissive mother's insensitivity to and lack of monitoring of the 
dispositional facial cues of her children. 
For a long time Mat showed seriously regressive functioning 
during therapy sessions. When he arrived, he would be ex­
tremely frightened, crying and clinging to his mother and trying 
to stop her from going out to the waiting-room. Mat was clumsy 
and somewhat dirty and smelly; he breathed heavily, continually 
salivated slightly, and was easily frightened of small sounds. He 
would disregard my presence and avoid eye contact with me, and 
he would not react verbally or otherwise to my attempts at 
making contact with him. He only spoke to me when giving 
orders. Here, we will concentrate on two pathological features of 
Mat's behavior that became increasingly apparent during the 
early phases of the therapy. 
One was Mat's inadequate and sometimes bizarre use of 
language. He did not obey the implicit pragmatic rules (Grice 
1975) underlying normal communicative exchanges: he would 
very often not respond to verbal inquiries but would sometimes

early phases of the therapy. 
One was Mat's inadequate and sometimes bizarre use of 
language. He did not obey the implicit pragmatic rules (Grice 
1975) underlying normal communicative exchanges: he would 
very often not respond to verbal inquiries but would sometimes 

304 / Developmental Perspectives 
repeat the question in a monotonous, echolalic fashion. When 
speaking, he would sometimes mix up the first-, second-, 
and third-person pronouns in his sentences. His interpretations 
were concretistic and literal, and he often used words with 
obscure, idiosyncratic meanings and interpreted expressions in­
dependently of their context of use. 
The second strikingly dysfunctional feature was the fact that 
Mat seemed incapable of either producing or understanding sym­
bolic play and pretense. His play activities consisted solely 
of repetitive, stereotypic actions using mainly wooden building 
blocks to make towers and roads. He was fascinated with toy 
cars, which he pushed back and forth between the wooden 
structures. However, for the most part he avoided using figura­
tive toys such as dolls, and he did not engage in any pretend 
activities. My efforts at engaging him in symbolic play were 
generally futile. In fact, Mat showed a clear aversion to human or 
animal toy figures and would turn away from them or throw 
them away when they were offered to him. According to his 
mother, he never played with figurative toys at home either: he 
was only interested in computer games and in building blocks. 
He never had a transitional object. His paintings were composed 
of diffuse lines and smeared paint, without any discernible figu­
rative content. 
It also soon became clear that Mat had serious difficulties 
with interpreting pretend activities and communications and 
had trouble understanding the marked, exaggerated pretend 
mode of expressions. For example, while he was painting, I 
pointed at the orange-colored water in his cup and said: "Look, 
it's just like orange juice!" He looked up with fright and said: 
"But you cannot drink that!" "Of course I can," I replied jokingly, 
with a marked- pretend intonation and raising the cup to my 
mouth, obviously pretending to drink the "orange juice." Mat 
became even more frightened (apparently believing that I was 
actually drinking the painting water) and shouted: "Don't do 
that, it cannot be drunk!" On another occasion I took out a 
puppet figure of a fox and asked- Mat if he wanted to play with 
the puppet. He said immediately that he didn't. But I proceeded 
to animate the puppet, making it walk around while speaking 
with a "foxy" marked intonation. Mat looked at the fox with : Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 305 
intense fear, as if it had really come alive. Then, nearly crying, he 
begged me to stop, almost shouting that he didn't like puppets. A 
final example: in one session, Mat and I played a board game in 
which one could win small treasure chests when arriving at 
certain positions. Without following the rules of the game, Mat 
always put his pieces on the winning positions and collected all 
the treasure chests, while I received nothing. I pretended to cry 
(in a clearly marked manner), complaining that I didn't get any 
treasure. Mat looked at me with fright, shouting: "Don't do that! 
Only babies cry! You are not a baby!" 
Both Mat's inability to understand or produce pretend play 
and his dysfunctions of language use described above are core 
features of the symptomatology of childhood autism. Other fea­
tures of Mat's pathology, such as his difficulties with impulse 
control, his tendency for tantrums, his perseverative, repetitive, 
and stereotypic object-manipulative activities with nonfigurative 
objects, his lack of eye contact, and his obsessive interest in 
vehicles, were also suggestive of a possible autistic disorder. 
Children with autism seem to lack the metarepresentational 
ability for "decoupling" (Baron-Cohen et al. 1985; Leslie 1994) 
that is argued to be a representational prerequisite both for 
understanding intentional mental states in others such as false 
beliefs and for understanding pretense (Leslie 1987). In normal 
development, children start to understand and produce pretend 
play by the end of the second year (Harris and Kavanaugh 1993), 
and they pass the so-called false-belief theory-of-mind tasks 
(Wimmer and Perner 1983) by 4 years of age (see chapter 5). 
Children with autism, however, tend to fail on these tasks even 
at a significantly higher mental age than 4 years. The related 
ability to distinguish appearance from reality (understanding 
that something looks like X, but is really Y) also emerges at 
around 4 years of age (Flavell et al. 1987). I tested Mat on two 
versions of the standard false-belief tasks as well as on a stand­
ard appearance-reality task at 4.6 and at 5.0 years (an age at 
which normal children already pass these tasks). He failed each 
time, showing a clear lack of understanding of false beliefs as 
well as of the appearance-reality distinction. 
While this provided potentially supporting evidence for the 
possibility that Mat was, in fact, autistic, this early suspicion

repeat the question in a monotonous, echolalic fashion. When 
speaking, he would sometimes mix up the first-, second-, 
and third-person pronouns in his sentences. His interpretations 
were concretistic and literal, and he often used words with 
obscure, idiosyncratic meanings and interpreted expressions in­
dependently of their context of use. 
The second strikingly dysfunctional feature was the fact that 
Mat seemed incapable of either producing or understanding sym­
bolic play and pretense. His play activities consisted solely 
of repetitive, stereotypic actions using mainly wooden building 
blocks to make towers and roads. He was fascinated with toy 
cars, which he pushed back and forth between the wooden 
structures. However, for the most part he avoided using figura­
tive toys such as dolls, and he did not engage in any pretend 
activities. My efforts at engaging him in symbolic play were 
generally futile. In fact, Mat showed a clear aversion to human or 
animal toy figures and would turn away from them or throw 
them away when they were offered to him. According to his 
mother, he never played with figurative toys at home either: he 
was only interested in computer games and in building blocks. 
He never had a transitional object. His paintings were composed 
of diffuse lines and smeared paint, without any discernible figu­
rative content. 
It also soon became clear that Mat had serious difficulties 
with interpreting pretend activities and communications and 
had trouble understanding the marked, exaggerated pretend 
mode of expressions. For example, while he was painting, I 
pointed at the orange-colored water in his cup and said: "Look, 
it's just like orange juice!" He looked up with fright and said: 
"But you cannot drink that!" "Of course I can," I replied jokingly, 
with a marked- pretend intonation and raising the cup to my 
mouth, obviously pretending to drink the "orange juice." Mat 
became even more frightened (apparently believing that I was 
actually drinking the painting water) and shouted: "Don't do 
that, it cannot be drunk!" On another occasion I took out a 
puppet figure of a fox and asked- Mat if he wanted to play with 
the puppet. He said immediately that he didn't. But I proceeded 
to animate the puppet, making it walk around while speaking 
with a "foxy" marked intonation. Mat looked at the fox with : Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 305 
intense fear, as if it had really come alive. Then, nearly crying, he 
begged me to stop, almost shouting that he didn't like puppets. A 
final example: in one session, Mat and I played a board game in 
which one could win small treasure chests when arriving at 
certain positions. Without following the rules of the game, Mat 
always put his pieces on the winning positions and collected all 
the treasure chests, while I received nothing. I pretended to cry 
(in a clearly marked manner), complaining that I didn't get any 
treasure. Mat looked at me with fright, shouting: "Don't do that! 
Only babies cry! You are not a baby!" 
Both Mat's inability to understand or produce pretend play 
and his dysfunctions of language use described above are core 
features of the symptomatology of childhood autism. Other fea­
tures of Mat's pathology, such as his difficulties with impulse 
control, his tendency for tantrums, his perseverative, repetitive, 
and stereotypic object-manipulative activities with nonfigurative 
objects, his lack of eye contact, and his obsessive interest in 
vehicles, were also suggestive of a possible autistic disorder. 
Children with autism seem to lack the metarepresentational 
ability for "decoupling" (Baron-Cohen et al. 1985; Leslie 1994) 
that is argued to be a representational prerequisite both for 
understanding intentional mental states in others such as false 
beliefs and for understanding pretense (Leslie 1987). In normal 
development, children start to understand and produce pretend 
play by the end of the second year (Harris and Kavanaugh 1993), 
and they pass the so-called false-belief theory-of-mind tasks

at a significantly higher mental age than 4 years. The related

was clearly refuted by later developments in the therapy, when 
his previously dormant ability to understand and use pretend 
play started to emerge. In the light of these developments, it 
became clear that his pervasive difficulties with understanding 
and producing symbolic play and pretense were not due to a 
genetically based lack of metarepresentational competence, but 
had a psychosocial origin. We believe that Mat was arrested in 
his development functioning at the level of "psychic equivalence" 
(cf. Fonagy and Target 1996 and chapter 6) because of the 
deviant and traumatizing affect-mirroring environment that his 
mother provided him with. But before expanding this hypoth­
esis, let us briefly describe two disturbing episodes from Mat's 
therapy that, we believe, illustrate well our hypothesis that Mat's 
mental functioning was arrested at the level of psychic equiva­
lence. 
Traumatizing "Reality-Play": 
Functioning at the Level of Psychic Equivalence 
At the beginning stages of the therapy there were, in fact, two 
occasions when it proved possible to engage Mat in "playing" 
using figurative, symbolic toys that depicted human persons. 
However, on both occasions Mat showed a clear lack of under­
standing of the "as-if nature of the situation, confusing play 
with reality and experiencing the aggressive and anxious fanta­
sies externalized in the play as actual reality of (re)traumatizing 
intensity. As a result, during these play episodes he became 
more and more excited, fearful, aggressive, and anxiety-rid den. 
These negative affects escalated to such traumatic intensity that 
for weeks to come Mat avoided the toys and even the corner of 
the room where these play episodes had taken place. 
During the first episode, I called Mat's attention to a toy 
bathroom at the corner of the room. In it there was a bathtub, a 
toilet, and—for some accidental reason—an oven. There was also 
a large chunk of playdough at hand and two (a smaller and a 
larger) naked baby dolls. Mat first took one of the dolls and put it 
in the bathtub. Then he took it out and made it sit on the toilet 
to make it poop. I called his attention to the chunk of playdough Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 307 
and told him he could make poop out of it if he wanted to. Mat 
tore off a piece excitedly and placed it in the toilet under the doll. 
He then found a toy spatula, showed it to me, and asked me 
what it was for. I told him, but he refused my explanation with a 
definite "no." He started to use the spatula to cut pieces off the 
chunk of playdough and said: This Is for putting the big poop 
into them!" He then took the doll from the toilet and stuck the 
"poop" he had cut off with the spatula to its bottom. He took 
another piece of playdough, one end of which looked elongated 
and "spiky." "This is the big spiky poop!" he said excitedly and, 
wheezing heavily, he stuck it to the bottom of the other doll. "Is 
the first one done yet?"—I asked. "No, no, he needs to poop a lot, 
he is going to stay there until Spring!"—Mat said. Then he took 
the small doll off the toilet and put the big doll on instead to 
make it poop as well. He started to squeeze the small doll with its 
bottom forward into the oven, shouting: "We will cook his bot­
tom!" He then took the "cooked" small doll out of the oven and 
tried to squeeze in the large one, but didn't quite succeed. So he 
put it into the bathtub instead. "Is he taking a bath?"—I asked. 
"No, he is dead!"—he answered. "How did he die?" "From the fire 
and the water, from the fire and the water!!!"—he shouted in 
uncontrollable excitement, his whole body shaking. Then he put 
the other doll back into the oven: "We'll cook his bottom, too, and 
so he will die as well!" "Who are these children?—I asked him. 
"Johnny and Mat"—he said (Johnny was his friend at the nurs­
ery). 
At the beginning of the second episode some two months 
later, I called Mat's attention to a large painted Russian doll that 
could be taken apart to reveal a smaller doll inside, which again 
could be taken apart to reveal an even smaller doll, and so on. 
Mat was very interested; he put the dolls back and then took 
them apart again. He then said: "I've seen a lot of babies on TV; 
they were all crippled: they didn't have hands, and legs, and 
ears, and they didn't have a weenie!" He laughed in excitement 
and ran to the dolls placed on a shelf to look for one with a penis. 
He found one, ran with it to the corner of the room where the toy 
bathroom was with the oven that was used in the first trauma­
tizing "reality-play." He opened the oven, looking for the small 
doll that he had "cooked to death" in it two months earlier. He

took the doll with the penis and started to shout: "I'm giving him 
an injection into his weenie, and into his bottom, and into his 
arm," and so on. He used a sharp pencil as his needle and 
injected the different parts of the doll with increasing excite­
ment. "Did you also get an injection?"—I asked him. "Yes, into 
my arm"—he said. He then ordered me to inject the doll's bottom 
while he was wildly poking his pencil into its penis. Then he 
shouted out: "Let's cut up his stomach and take out the baby!" 
He continued to give shots to the doll, more and more wildly, 
until the pencil broke. "Now we'll put a nail into his weenie! . . . 
Nailed baby!!!"—he cried. "We'll heat him up! . . . We'll give him a 
cold shower!!!"—he shouted as he was pressing a toy pretzel (the 
"cold shower") as hard as he could into the doll's nailed penis. 
Moving to the Pretend Mode of Functioning: 
The Discovery of the Affect-Regulative Potentials 
of Markedness and Pretend Play 
After about six months Mat's behavior and metacommunication 
started to show signs of qualitative improvement. He was much 
less disorganized, his speech cleared up and showed much less 
confusion and fewer idiosyncratic elements, he held and even 
initiated eye contact, and he seemed to start to enjoy coming to 
the sessions. These changes coincided with a remarkable play 
episode in which he seemed to have "discovered" the meaning of 
the marked "as-if" mode of expressions and the affect-regulative 
potentials of the pretend mode of functioning. This episode clear­
ly changed the course of the therapy. 
We were playing the board game mentioned before in which 
small treasure chests could be won. Disregarding both me and 
the rules of the game, Mat threw his dice and collected as many 
treasure chests as he could again and again, while I got nothing. 
This was the occasion when I pretended to cry a little, with a 
clearly marked, exaggerated "as-if intonation. Mat became very 
frightened and told me to stop because only babies cry, and I 
was not a baby. I stopped immediately and tried to calm Mat by 
explaining gently that I wasn't really sad and wasn't really cry-Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 309 
ing—that I was just pretending to cry. Mat looked at me atten­
tively and for a long time, as if slowly understanding (maybe for 
the first time) what was meant by these words. He seemed to 
calm down and continued to play. At the next session he came in 
with a broad smile on his face and announced immediately that 
he wanted to play the board game again. When it was my turn. 
Mat looked at me smiling and told me that he remembered that 
last time I was sad, but now I didn't need to be sad any more 
because he would let me go directly to the position where I can 
get the treasure chests. Then he pointed at the bolted door of the 
tower on the board game that was guarded by a dragon and said: 
"This is where we need to go in and save the woman!" "Aren't 
you afraid of the dragon?"—I asked him. "No, together we shall 
kill it!"—Mat said, smiling. Then he again asked me whether I 
was sad. I answered that indeed I was feeling a bit sad, and I 
pretended to cry a little. He watched me "crying" with fascination 
and then consoled me by helping me win some more treasure. 
He then went directly to the tower, killed the dragon, and saved 
the "woman." 
When we finished playing. Mat found another board game: a 
game somewhat like checkers. He asked me how to play it, and I 
told him that if he stepped over my piece, I would "die" and 
would have to take my piece off the board. Mat then stepped over 
my piece and took it off the board, watching me carefully and 
asking whether I was sad to have died. Guessing what he ex­
pected me to do, I pretended to cry a little. Mat smiled broadly 
and told me: "Don't be sad, but step over me, and then I shall 
die!" "And you won't be sad?"—I asked. "No, because I like to 
die!"—he answered cheerfully. 
We went on playing these two games repeatedly for a few 
months. We developed several variations on the same theme: one 
of us would get into some kind of trouble, pretend to be sad and 
cry or even die, until the other invariably came to the rescue. The 
themes always had to do with dying and coming alive, getting 
into trouble and being saved, getting wounded and being cured, 
becoming sad and being cheered up. Mat enjoyed these games 
enormously. It was as if he had discovered a whole new world: 
the world of "as-if" reality.

310 / Developmental Perspectives 
During our last session we played a new board game in which 
we were hunters in the jungle. "You are the Mother-hunter, and I 
am the Father-hunter," Mat said. As usual, we got into all sorts 
of trouble again and again, but each was invariably saved by the 
other. At the end of the hour I wanted to escort Mat to the 
waiting-room (we had to pass through two doors and go up a 
staircase). Mat said: "No, stay here, I'll go on my own." I followed 
him from a distance and saw how he met his surprised mother 
on his own, smiling broadly and telling her: "When I grow up, I'll 
be a hunter, and I'll* shoot a rabbit!" His mother never brought 
him to therapy again. 
DISCUSSION 
We believe that Mat's case illustrates well our theory of the role 
of markedness as a vehicle of affective self-regulation, both in 
affect-mirroring interactions and in imaginary pretend play. It 
also helps us illustrate our hypothesis that adaptive mirroring of 
negative affects may play an important role in the young child's 
transition in representational functioning from the level of psy­
chic equivalence to a level of mentalizing where pretend play is 
possible. Finally, it sheds light on how a certain type of deviant 
parental mirroring environment, in which the negative affective 
displays of the child result in contingent but unmarked and 
realistic negative emotional reactions of the caregiver, may lead 
to a developmental arrest at the level of psychic equivalence 
functioning. In our discussion we shall restrict our attention to 
only these aspects of Mat's case. 
Mat's mother had a dismissive, but at the same time intrusive 
and overcontrolling personality. She also seemed to lack the 
ability adaptively to mirror and thereby to modulate the negative 
affect states of her child. Their emotional life was dominated by 
negative affect that tended to escalate rather than subside as a 
result of their affective interactions. Mat's expressions of nega­
tive feelings tended to result in contingent and realistic negative 
affective reactions by her mother, leading to an increase in Mat's 
negative affect state, which sometimes reached traumatizing Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 311 
intensity. An example of such deviant affect-mirroring interac­
tions (lacking markedness) is the recurring episode in which the 
obstinately withholding boy would sit on the toilet "for hours" 
while his mother, sitting next to him, tried to persuade him to 
defecate. One can assume that Mat was experiencing a variety 
of growing negative feelings, such as abdominal pain, anxiety, 
anger, and anticipatory fear, and he displayed at least some of 
these feelings. His obstinate refusal to produce feces and his 
negative affect displays induced growing frustration, anger, 
hatred, and, eventually, rage in his mother. This gruesome inter­
change predictably culminated in violence and traumatization 
when Mat's mother "lost her head" and beat Mat. 
In adaptive affect-regulative interactions involving marked 
parental mirroring of negative affects, the child's experience is 
that the contingent externalization of his negative emotion states 
(in the form of the parent's marked mirroring displays) results in 
a positive soothing effect (Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999). Such 
interactions establish an association between externalizing one's 
negative affects and consequent affect regulation. We hypoth­
esized that such affect-regulative mirroring interactions may, 
therefore, provide a proto-form and experiential prerequisite for 
the child's later ability to actively use marked forms of external­
izations of his negative states in pretend play and in imagination 
in an effort to achieve successful self-regulation. We believe 
that Mat was deprived of such crucial experiences of emotion-
regulative interactions in which markedness, externalization of 
negative affects, and consequent affect regulation could have 
become associated. Instead, his traumatizing interactions with 
his mother, in which she mirrored his negative states in an 
unmarked, realistic manner, leading to escalation (rather than 
modulation) of his painful affects, led to an association that 
related contingent externalization of negative internal states to 
anticipated traumatization. This then led to a phobic avoidance 
of possibilities for symbolic externalization of internal states in 
the forms of imagination, symbolic play, or figurative drawing 
and painting. 
The lack of adaptive mirroring interactions involving marked­
ness also resulted in a decreased ability to recognize the func­
tional significance of markedness as a generalized communica-

chic equivalence to a level of mentalizing where pretend play is 
possible. Finally, it sheds light on how a certain type of deviant 
parental mirroring environment, in which the negative affective 
displays of the child result in contingent but unmarked and 
realistic negative emotional reactions of the caregiver, may lead 
to a developmental arrest at the level of psychic equivalence 
functioning. In our discussion we shall restrict our attention to 
only these aspects of Mat's case. 
Mat's mother had a dismissive, but at the same time intrusive 
and overcontrolling personality. She also seemed to lack the 
ability adaptively to mirror and thereby to modulate the negative 
affect states of her child. Their emotional life was dominated by 
negative affect that tended to escalate rather than subside as a 
result of their affective interactions. Mat's expressions of nega­
tive feelings tended to result in contingent and realistic negative 
affective reactions by her mother, leading to an increase in Mat's 
negative affect state, which sometimes reached traumatizing Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 311 
intensity. An example of such deviant affect-mirroring interac­
tions (lacking markedness) is the recurring episode in which the 
obstinately withholding boy would sit on the toilet "for hours" 
while his mother, sitting next to him, tried to persuade him to 
defecate. One can assume that Mat was experiencing a variety 
of growing negative feelings, such as abdominal pain, anxiety, 
anger, and anticipatory fear, and he displayed at least some of 
these feelings. His obstinate refusal to produce feces and his 
negative affect displays induced growing frustration, anger, 
hatred, and, eventually, rage in his mother. This gruesome inter­
change predictably culminated in violence and traumatization 
when Mat's mother "lost her head" and beat Mat. 
In adaptive affect-regulative interactions involving marked 
parental mirroring of negative affects, the child's experience is 
that the contingent externalization of his negative emotion states 
(in the form of the parent's marked mirroring displays) results in 
a positive soothing effect (Gergely and Watson 1996, 1999). Such 
interactions establish an association between externalizing one's 
negative affects and consequent affect regulation. We hypoth­
esized that such affect-regulative mirroring interactions may, 
therefore, provide a proto-form and experiential prerequisite for 
the child's later ability to actively use marked forms of external­
izations of his negative states in pretend play and in imagination 
in an effort to achieve successful self-regulation. We believe 
that Mat was deprived of such crucial experiences of emotion-
regulative interactions in which markedness, externalization of 
negative affects, and consequent affect regulation could have 
become associated. Instead, his traumatizing interactions with 
his mother, in which she mirrored his negative states in an 
unmarked, realistic manner, leading to escalation (rather than 
modulation) of his painful affects, led to an association that 
related contingent externalization of negative internal states to 
anticipated traumatization. This then led to a phobic avoidance 
of possibilities for symbolic externalization of internal states in 
the forms of imagination, symbolic play, or figurative drawing 
and painting. 
The lack of adaptive mirroring interactions involving marked­
ness also resulted in a decreased ability to recognize the func­
tional significance of markedness as a generalized communica-

tive code indicating decoupling from reality. As a result, Mat was 
initially quite incapable of differentiating pretense from reality 
and would experience .the marked symbolic externalizations of 
negative affects as being real rather than as being only represen­
tations of reality. In other words, Mat was arrested at the level of 
psychic equivalence functioning where feelings, thoughts, fanta­
sies, and pretend activities were all experienced at a single level 
as being parts of reality. For example, when he used the spatula 
for scooping feces, he could not simultaneously understand that 
the proper function of a spatula in reality is entirely different: 
the imaginary function became reality itself. 
However, Mat was not imprisoned forever in a mental world of 
psychic equivalence. The therapeutic breakthrough involving the 
"pretending to cry" episode indicates that corrective emotional 
and representational experience involving adaptive mirroring of 
negative affects was possible and therapeutic. His first reaction 
to the therapist's marked and playful expression of sadness and 
crying was at the level of psychic equivalence: he showed an 
initial confusion of pretense with reality and consequently be­
came frightened. However, the conspicuous lack of negative 
consequences, the repeated presentation of a clearly marked 
emotion display, and the calming verbal explanation that "this is 
not for real" could activate the child's dormant representational 
capacities that, eventually and with practice, led to an adaptive 
understanding of the functional use of markedness and the 
pretend mode of mentalizing. Mat, perhaps for the first time, 
could experience that marked externalizations of negative affec­
tive states do not necessarily culminate in trauma but can lead 
to positive emotions of sharing, empathy, and soothing. He dis­
covered that "he likes to die" as long as he is in the pretend mode 
with a self-regulating other. 
CONCLUSION 
Mat's case illustrated two central points about the role of marked 
externalizations in emotional self-regulation: (a) It exemplified 
how the sustained lack of early emotion-regulative experiences Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 313 
involving marked affect-mirroring with the primary attachment 
figure may result in a developmental arrest at the level of psychic 
equivalence functioning, (b) It showed that in child psycho­
therapy, the sensitive use of marked externalizations of negative 
affects by the therapist may lead to corrective emotional and 
representational experience, helping the child to move from the 
level of psychic equivalence to the adaptive use of the pretend 
mode of mental functioning in the service of affect regulation. 
It seems clear in Mat's case that his metarepresentational 
capacities were not genetically impaired, but their use for affec­
tive self-regulation was seriously undeveloped or inhibited by his 
experience with the deviant style of affective reactivity of his 
mother, which lacked markedness and resulted in a traumatic 
escalation of Mat's negative affect states. However, we do not 
know how general this acquired representational dysfunction 
was in Mat's case. It is possible that the boy's phobic avoidance 
of symbolic externalizations was restricted to the specific attach­
ment context involving his mother and to situations involving 
separation from his mother (as in the nursery or in the theraT 
peutic setting). We could not rule out the possibility that Mat 
may have had different and possibly more adaptive emotional 
interactions with other attachment figures in his life—such as 
his father or grandmother—where he, in fact, could already have 
attained the pretend mode of mental functioning. 
As discussed in chapter 1 (see also Cicchetti and Rogosch 
1997; Rutter 1987; E. E. Werner 1990), the existence of at least 
one congenial attachment context fostering representational 
development may be sufficient to establish relatively mature 
mentalizing or reflective functioning. High reflective function, in 
turn, has been shown to correlate with the capacity successfully 
to metabolize and cope with the potentially dangerous affective 
consequences of traumatization (Allen 2001; Fonagy, Steele, et 
al. 1994). If Mat had already established the capacity to use the 
pretend mode in some alternative attachment context, then the 
therapist's success may have involved no more than lifting the 
domain-specific inhibition of Mat's otherwise functioning ability 
to use marked and symbolic externalizations for self-regulation 
(for a similar example, see the case of Rebecca discussed in 
chapter 6).

But what if a child has no reasonable attachment relation­
ships at all and comes to experience marked affect-mirroring 
and affect-regulative symbolic externalizations only in psycho­
therapy? This, in fact, may have been so in Mat's case. To what 
degree can such therapeutic experiences functionally substitute 
for the effects of secure attachment in bringing about the unfold­
ing of mentalization capacities—thereby transforming psychic 
equivalence into the pretend mode of mental functioning? We 
hope that future clinical research will shed more light on this 
important question. 
A further related issue concerns the treatment of adolescents 
and adult patients who show a pathological fixation of mental 
functioning at the level of psychic equivalence. Can, for example, 
our developmental model and its application to child psycho­
therapy shed new light on the nature of therapeutic change that 
the psychoanalytic treatment of adult borderline patients can 
achieve? In chapters 9-11 we take up this issue in greater detail. 
Here it will be sufficient to point out that even though psycho­
analytic psychotherapy of adult patients applies different—and 
more age-appropriate—methods from those used in child 
psychotherapy (such as free association and verbal interpre­
tations instead of evocative pretend play), these techniques 
nevertheless seem to exploit the same underlying psychological 
mechanisms—markedness, contingency detection, and social 
biofeedback—that are operative in parental affect-mirroring and 
symbolic play. For example, the formal features of the psycho­
analytic setting as well as the rules of conduct specified in the 
analytic contract can be interpreted as establishing salient fea­
tures of markedness that clearly distinguish the use of language 
in the analytic discourse from its everyday use in communicative 
exchanges. The primary normative function of everyday linguis­
tic communication is the efficient exchange of novel and relevant 
information between members of the language community that 
fosters survival. The implicit pragmatic rules of verbal communi­
cation specified in the so-called Gricean maxims (such as "Be 
relevant" or "Be succinct"—Grice 1975), to which we automati­
cally adhere in everyday communication, serve to optimize pre­
cisely this function (see Sperber and Wilson 1995). In psycho­
analysis and psychoanalytic therapy, however, this primary Marked Affect-Mirroring and Pretend Play / 315 
function of language use is explicitly de-emphasized: the pa­
tient—as well as the therapist—is effectively "unplugged" from 
the normative constraints of linguistic communication by sus­
pending the Gricean maxims and replacing them with the rule 
of "free association." In classical psychoanalysis, lying on the 
couch, lack of eye contact, and the consequent deprivation from 
on-line metacommunicative feedback from the therapist during 
verbal exchanges also serve to suspend the application of the 
pragmatic rules that govern everyday communication. These 
normative rules are similarly suspended as regards the analyst: 
she can choose to remain silent, is free to provide no informative 
answers to the patient's inquiries, or can turn the question back, 
asking about the underlying motives of the patient rather than 
dealing with his consciously intended meaning. The analyst is 
also sanctioned to provide interpretations that do not refer to the 
literal meaning of the patient's verbal communication but to its 
inferred underlying affective content. 
Note that these highly specialized psychoanalytic rules of 
verbal exchange serve to make the externalization of internal 
affective contents the primary function of language use within 
the therapeutic context. The darkened room, the relaxed and 
safe atmosphere, and the patient's lying on the couch all serve 
the purpose of focusing the patient's attention on his internal 
mental contents, which are to be externalized within the safe, 
reality-decoupled "as-if world of the analytic situation. The dif­
ferential features and rules of the psychoanalytic setting func­
tion to "mark" the externalized verbal expressions of internal 
affective contents as "being not for real" and as being "non-
consequential." 
The therapist's "hovering attention" is a specialized state of 
attunement the aim of which is to identify the patient's internal 
affect states in order to mirror them back to the patient in 
the form of marked interpretations and reactions. Through the 
transference the developmental setting of the original attach­
ment context is recreated and the dysfunctional forms of 
parental affective reactions are reexperienced in the reality-de­
coupled safe environment of the analytic situation. At the same 
time, the analyst provides corrective emotional and representa­
tional experience for the patient through emotion-regulative

marked externalizations of the patient's affects in the form of 
mirroring interpretations or expressions. Similarly to the pro­
cesses of social biofeedback in parental affect-mirroring, these 
contingent and marked externalizations serve the multiple func­
tions of (a) sensitizing the patient to his internal affective states, 
(b) establishing second-order representations for these states by 
providing verbal labels for them, and (c) adaptively transforming 
their affective content by externalizing them in a modified inter­
pretive perspective. 
The central therapeutic aim of psychoanalysis is therefore 
to foster the capacity for "mentalization of affectivity" in the 
patient—a topic that we address in greater detail in chapter 11. 
Through sensitization to and establishing second-order repre­
sentations for his internal affective states, the patient becomes 
able to apprehend and reflect on his subjective affective contents 
as mentalized representational states, with minimal risk of these 
being confused with external reality. Through the processes of 
social biofeedback, the therapist's marked externalizations of the 
patient's internal affective contents help to establish a new in­
trospective capacity in the patient for the "inward expression 
of affects." This comes about through the internalization of 
the newly experienced safe forms of affect-regulative marked 
externalizations provided by the therapist's mirroring interpreta­
tions. This way the patient gradually learns new mental skills of 
affective self-regulation: he becomes able to express internally, 
apprehend, and modify his emotional impulses .by "mirroring 
himself" through generating marked forms of inward expres­
sions of internal affective contents. In chapter 11 we provide 
clinical case illustrations for the different levels of mentalization 
of affectivity that we can encounter in adult patients with affec­
tive disorders of varying severities. 8

In previous chapters we have considered the development of 
mentalization up to about the age of 5 years, when the autobio­
graphical self first emerges (see chapter 5). While certain devel­
opmental disorders are already apparent at this age, many do 
not emerge until adolescence or later. This chapter adds a fur­
ther stage to our description of the development of reflective 
function, considering the implications of the cognitive develop­
ments associated with adolescence for the ontogeny of men­
talization. The key question addressed in this chapter concerns 
the increased frequency of various kinds of mental disorder at 
this developmental stage, the worsening of preexisting condi­
tions, and the emergence of new conditions specifically linked to 
adolescence, as well as the onset of many that are lifelong 
problems but whose onset is linked with this age. That is, we 
attempt to answer the deceptively simple question of why break­
down occurs relatively often in adolescence. We suggest that this 
might be understood partly in terms of the vicissitudes of reflec­
tive function during this developmental phase. The chapter 
begins with a summary of the view of self-development advo­
cated in this book, which pulls together the threads of the

INTRODUCTION 
One explanation of the rise in psychopathology in adolescence 
was provided by the Laufers: "The break in the developmental 
process of adolescence is the pathology, because the outcome of 
such a break must be a distorted relationship to oneself as a 
sexual being, a passive relationship to the parent of the same 
sex, and the giving up of the wish or the ability to leave infantile 
sexuality behind" (Laufer and Laufer 1984, pp. ix-x). 
We all recall the heat of sexuality in adolescence, but is it 
generally the cause of the breakdown, or is the breakdown the 
result of earlier developmental disturbances, its form colored by 
the intensification of sexual feelings? We think that the latter is 
more likely. An example of the clues that suggest that we need to 
look beyond a hormonal upheaval is that while puberty arrives 
earlier and earlier, not all adolescent disorders are occurring at 
an earlier age. Thus, although eating disorders have been devel­
oping at younger ages, criminal activity and suicide have not (D. 
J. Smith 1995). This suggests that the prevalence reflects social 
more than physical—sexual—pressures. The picture of "adoles­
cent turmoil" was replaced in the 1980s and 1990s by a model in 
which there is a sequence of bodily changes, any of which might 
trigger emotional upheaval. Which biological events might do so 
could be quite idiosyncratic, depending to a degree on what 
particular changes represent to the adolescent (Paikoff and 
Brooks-Gunn 1991). 
In this chapter, we focus on the interaction of two matura­
tional processes, which may be quite central to a number of 
different kinds of pathology in adolescence. The first is the leap 
to formal operations thinking and the consequent intensification 
of pressure for interpersonal understanding. This is normally 
thought of in biological terms, but in our frame of reference the 
development of symbolic thought is intertwined throughout 
childhood with emotional growth in the context of attachment. 
This is where we make a link to the second process: the pressure 
toward separation from the external and internally represented 
parents, which, we suggest, can reveal developmental failures or 
weaknesses that were established much earlier in life, but which 
it may have been possible to conceal at this earlier stage. More 
n Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 319 
specifically, we try to describe how some affective disturbances 
in adolescence can be thought about in terms of an inadequate 
consolidation of symbolic capacity. 
Thus, we believe that one thing that drives—but can also 
derail—the achievement of separateness is freshly enhanced 
cognitive complexity, which means that the adolescent is 
faced with the task of integrating a far more complicated set of 
thoughts about his own and others' feelings and motivations. As 
a result, there is a developmental hypersensitivity to mental 
states, which may overwhelm the adolescent's capacity to cope 
with thoughts and feelings except through bodily symptoms or 
physical action. Although such adolescents may seem able to 
talk and think about mental states quite fluently, more abstract 
ideas about mental states create a considerable strain on the 
adolescent's system. This can lead to an apparently dramatic 
breakdown in mentalization, withdrawal from the social world, 
and the intensification of anxiety and enactments. The extent to 
which these changes lead to long-term difficulty may depend not 
only on the inherent strength of the adolescent's psychic struc­
tures, but also on the capacity of the environment to support the 
adolescent's weakened mentalizing function. Naturally, this is 
further complicated by the fact that the adolescent may under­
mine the capacity of institutions to support him. 
THEORY OF SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
The theory of self-development on which our ideas about adoles­
cence are based has been described in the preceding chapters. 
Here we briefly summarize the propositions within the theory 
that will be central in our discussion of adolescent psycho-
pathology: 
1. The psychological self is rooted in the attribution of mental 
states to self and other (chapters 1 and 3); 
2. This capacity emerges through interaction with the caregiver, 
in the context of an attachment relationship, via a process 
of mirroring (see chapter 4). Internal experience acquires a

J. Smith 1995). This suggests that the prevalence reflects social 
more than physical—sexual—pressures. The picture of "adoles­
cent turmoil" was replaced in the 1980s and 1990s by a model in 
which there is a sequence of bodily changes, any of which might 
trigger emotional upheaval. Which biological events might do so 
could be quite idiosyncratic, depending to a degree on what 
particular changes represent to the adolescent (Paikoff and 
Brooks-Gunn 1991). 
In this chapter, we focus on the interaction of two matura­
tional processes, which may be quite central to a number of 
different kinds of pathology in adolescence. The first is the leap 
to formal operations thinking and the consequent intensification 
of pressure for interpersonal understanding. This is normally 
thought of in biological terms, but in our frame of reference the 
development of symbolic thought is intertwined throughout 
childhood with emotional growth in the context of attachment. 
This is where we make a link to the second process: the pressure 
toward separation from the external and internally represented 
parents, which, we suggest, can reveal developmental failures or 
weaknesses that were established much earlier in life, but which 
it may have been possible to conceal at this earlier stage. More 
n Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 319 
specifically, we try to describe how some affective disturbances 
in adolescence can be thought about in terms of an inadequate 
consolidation of symbolic capacity. 
Thus, we believe that one thing that drives—but can also 
derail—the achievement of separateness is freshly enhanced 
cognitive complexity, which means that the adolescent is 
faced with the task of integrating a far more complicated set of 
thoughts about his own and others' feelings and motivations. As 
a result, there is a developmental hypersensitivity to mental 
states, which may overwhelm the adolescent's capacity to cope 
with thoughts and feelings except through bodily symptoms or 
physical action. Although such adolescents may seem able to 
talk and think about mental states quite fluently, more abstract 
ideas about mental states create a considerable strain on the 
adolescent's system. This can lead to an apparently dramatic 
breakdown in mentalization, withdrawal from the social world, 
and the intensification of anxiety and enactments. The extent to 
which these changes lead to long-term difficulty may depend not 
only on the inherent strength of the adolescent's psychic struc­
tures, but also on the capacity of the environment to support the 
adolescent's weakened mentalizing function. Naturally, this is 
further complicated by the fact that the adolescent may under­
mine the capacity of institutions to support him. 
THEORY OF SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
The theory of self-development on which our ideas about adoles­
cence are based has been described in the preceding chapters. 
Here we briefly summarize the propositions within the theory 
that will be central in our discussion of adolescent psycho-
pathology: 
1. The psychological self is rooted in the attribution of mental 
states to self and other (chapters 1 and 3); 
2. This capacity emerges through interaction with the caregiver, 
in the context of an attachment relationship, via a process 
of mirroring (see chapter 4). Internal experience acquires a 

r~ 
320 / Developmental Perspectives 
second-order representation through the internalization of 
the mirroring actions of the caregiver (chapter 5). 
3. The rudimentary early experience of the internal world con­
sists of two alternating modes—a mode of "psychic equiva­
lence" (where internal = external) and a mode of "pretend" 
(where internal is forever separated from external) (chap­
ter 6). 
4. Safe, playful interaction with caregivers leads to the integra­
tion of these modes, creating mentalization (chapter 6). 
5. In the case of chronically insensitive or misattuned care-
giving, a fault is created in the construction of the self, 
whereby the infant is forced to internalize the representa­
tion of the object's state of mind as a core part of himself 
(chapter 7). 
6. In early development this "alien self is dealt with by exter­
nalization; as mentalization develops, it can be increasingly 
woven into the self, creating an illusion of cohesion (this is 
discussed more fully in part III, chapters 9 and 10). 
7. The disorganization of the self disorganizes attachment rela­
tionships by creating a constant need for projective identifica­
tion (for the externalization of the alien self) in any attach­
ment relationship (part III, chapter 10). 
SEPARATION AS THE PRIMARY TASK 
OF ADOLESCENCE 
So how can this model help us to understand normal and 
abnormal development in adolescence? Margaret Mahler (Mahler 
et al. 1975) saw separation-individuation as a gradual distancing 
from the mother, whereby the transition from dependency to 
independent functioning went on throughout the life-cycle as a 
more or less continuous process of distancing from the introject 
of the lost symbiotic mother. Peter Bios (1979) extended Mahler's 
model and identified the critical change in adolescence as the 
loosening of infantile object ties. He emphasized that individu-Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 321 
ation could be seen as a process or as an achievement, but both 
were integral components of the adolescent process. Mahler's 
model, and its extension in the work of Peter Bios, are clearly 
related to our formulation. Mahler's symbiotic mother is func­
tionally equivalent to our notion of an alien self.l Greater sepa­
ration in adolescence means that the alien self, or symbiotic 
mother, can no longer be externalized in interaction with the 
caregiver. The enactments and manipulations necessary to pro­
ject the alien self into the parent have to become more dramatic 
as separation increases. This (for example, fighting with the 
parents) might have been mistaken for striving to achieve an 
independent identity. Until a partner can be found with whom 
the adolescent can reestablish a symbiotic relationship, there is 
a hiatus in externalization, which creates enormous pressure for 
adolescents whose alien self cannot be integrated. 
Erikson sees the attainment of self-identity as a precondition 
of true engagement (Erikson 1968). This overriding emphasis 
on individuation neglects its dialectic counterpart, attachment 
(Blatt and Behrends 1987; Blatt and Blass 1990). Real separate-
ness implies an ability to recognize both difference and similar­
ity, and it is paradoxically the latter rather than the former that 
may be a true mark of autonomy. The challenge to identity in 
adolescence comes from accepting not difference, but similarity. 
The adolescent with a secure sense of connection and likeness to 
the caregiver can tolerate physical separation, whereas one who 
has projected parts of the self and needs to perceive the caregiver 
as completely different feels that he has lost his identity if he is 
separated from her. Thus, an exaggerated claim to be different 
may be seen as a defensive response to pressure for separation, 
which threatens the return of projected parts of the self. 
Internal coherence and mental separation of self and object, 
then, require the physical presence of the other. Otherwise, the 
adolescent fears that the residual core self will be swamped, he 
will lose contact with it, and his sense of identity will be lost.

as a normal stage, but the "symbiotic mother" as a very common deviation from 
normal development.

322 / Developmental Perspectives 
Physical separateness is, in our view, the smaller of two 
developmental challenges that face each child in adolescence. 
The second arises out of the enhanced awareness of emotional 
and cognitive complexity, most pivotally in the context of at­
tachment relationships. In adolescence, emotional development 
reaches "a new developmental tier" (Fischer et al. 1990) with the 
capacity for abstract thinking. Both the appreciation and the 
expression of affect take on a new dimension and thus many 
new meanings. For example, rather than attributing basic emo­
tional states, adolescents start to contemplate adultlike scripts 
for emotions. Feelings such as jealousy or resentment become 
elaborated into scenarios. This new capacity for abstraction and 
elaboration is tenuously maintained and quickly reversed by 
emotional stresses generated by the developmental process. 
These stresses are often internal—for example, due to conflict or 
unfamiliar and intense emotional states—but they may also 
arise from overwhelming external situations such as parental 
mental illness. 
Building on Piaget's concept of reversibility, A. E. Thompson 
(1985, 1986) considers affect "irreversible" when the child can­
not imagine other reactions to the object, or feelings other than 
the one he currently feels. Reversibility gradually emerges be­
tween middle childhood and early adolescence. Slowly the child 
wonders what it might take not to feel as he does, or to change 
the feeling state of,the object. With5formal operations fully de­
ployed, the child begins to think of general principles rather 
than aspects of the specific situation that can explain or change 
emotions. However, while advances in the capacity for abstract 
thought enable the adolescent to take a step back and to monitor 
himself and others, this does not necessarily feel like a good 
thing. For the adolescent, as experiencer of affect in himself and 
others, the world is suddenly much more complicated and con­
fusing. Thus, he needs at times to withdraw from interactions, or 
from mentalization in general, to take a rest from the ramifica­
tions of alternative motivations. 
For example, the child of a depressed mother may at the age 
of 3 years feel that his mother lies in bed because he is bad or 
boring or unlovable. At 5, this child may have come to realize 
that the mother's behavior reflects a state of mind, depression, Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 323 
which does not necessarily relate to her feelings about him; it is 
something in her own head. At 7, the child may have produced a 
contextual explanation: "Mom is depressed because her Mom 
died, then Dad left, and we've got hardly any money, and she 
hasn't got friends." However, from perhaps 11 on many disturb­
ing new possibilities enter the picture, hinging on the fact 
that emotional states need not be as they are and people have 
choices about how they respond to them. Interestingly, this may 
lead the child back to a more sophisticated version of his first 
assumptions—"Why doesn't Mom get up and do something if 
she feels so terrible? If she wasn't getting something out of lying 
in bed, she wouldn't keep doing it for so long. OK, she feels 
terrible, but she could get up and come to my parent-teacher 
evening. If she really loved me, she would." Later, the adolescent 
formulation might be in terms of depression being a result of 
loss of love, or conflict, or the parents' marriage, or, more ego-
centrically, the parents' disappointment in him. These new ways 
of thinking about people's feelings and behavior, as well as 
about his own feelings and behavior, can be overwhelming, and 
the adolescent needs to absorb the implications. There may also 
be a reaction against mentalizing. Some adolescents may engage 
in arcade games, surfing the Internet, and so on; others may 
develop a passion for stereotyped soap-operas and romantic 
novels, in which emotions are again presented as simple and 
intense. They may also retreat into apparently mind-numbing 
music. 
The entire developmental process is fluid and dynamic, with 
enhanced cognitive capacity generating enriched mentalizing, 
which, in turn, leads to anxiety and/or preoccupation. As this 
state undermines abstract thought, the adolescent may—in ad­
dition to sometimes switching off into really mindless activity— 
regress in apparent relief to a thoughtless, socially insensitive 
state. Thus, the parents become infuriated that the adolescent, 
who is obviously capable of keeping other people in mind and 
imagining the effect of his actions, behaves as though he were 
oblivious, selfish, and willfully inconsiderate. 
In the second section we describe two cases that illustrate, in 
their different ways and degrees of impairment of mentalization, 
what we see as the dual challenge of adolescence: the potentially

CLINICAL ILLUSTRATION: "TONY" 
Tony was 15 years old when he was referred to a residential 
adolescent psychiatric unit. His parents, his teachers, and his 
psychiatrist had become very concerned about explicit violent 
threats that he had made to his parents, peers, and women 
teachers. He was admitted after threatening another boy with a 
knife. He was a sullen, stocky boy who did not talk to staff or 
peers on the unit, usually glaring and snarling at them if they 
tried to engage him. 
Tony was the only son of a failed businessman and a former 
teacher. His unpredictable violent outbursts had worsened six 
months before admission, at which point his parents had asked 
for him to be taken into the care of the social services. His 
history is far from unusual for a violent adolescent, except for 
the remarkably close relationship that Tony had with his out­
wardly loving and affectionate mother. As a baby he was said to 
have been valued beyond measure, after a long period when his 
parents had thought they could not have a child. His mother 
abandoned her promising career in educational administration 
to spend all her time looking after little Tony. The relationship 
between them was so intense that the father often felt jealous 
and resentful, even though he, too, had been delighted to have a 
son. The mother insisted for some years on sharing their bed­
room with Tony, excluding the father; until Tony was 10 years 
old, she would not go out at night with the father because she 
did not want to leave Tony with anyone else. 
Tony's father was never violent toward him. He was, how­
ever, abusive to his wife. His frustration in his business deal­
ings and his sense of being neglected by Tony's mother led him 
to become increasingly aggressive, screaming and threatening. 
He occasionally hit the mother, to which she responded with Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 325 
hysterical rage of her own and intimate discussions with her 
son about the father's behavior. As you might expect, Tony was 
frequently the focus of the father's rage. Her wish to protect and 
indulge Tony was treated with derision and threats to leave her. 
Tony often witnessed these confrontations, and as a young boy 
he was reported to have tried to shield her; when he was older, 
he threatened to kill his father if he did not leave his mother 
alone. 
Meanwhile, Tony was doing badly. He was encopretic until he 
was 10; at elementary school he made poor educational pro­
gress, and he was teased and bullied. Once at secondary school, 
he increasingly became the bully, terrorizing the playground 
with his unpredictable violent outbursts and too difficult for 
teachers to contain in class. 
When Tony was admitted to the adolescent unit, everyone 
was frightened of him. He refused to give a history to the admit­
ting psychiatrist and barely talked to the nurses or other resi­
dents. No one wanted to share a room with him. The young men 
in particular shunned and ridiculed him, and he was defended 
only by a girl, Elaine, who, like him, was surly and isolated. After 
Elaine stood up for Tony, they formed a wordless friendship 
based on hatred of the others. The only person he talked to a 
little was a young trainee psychologist who was assigned to carry 
out his psychological testing. She found that he could hardly 
read and had minimal mathematical skills, and she realized that 
she needed to help him navigate the minefield of mortification 
represented by aptitude and attainment tests. In doing so, Tony 
began to express how he had hated school and everyone there, 
and how he had desperately tried, on his own, to learn to read 
better but had then given up in shame and frustration. Because 
he seemed able to talk to her to some degree, the team decided to 
offer him some sessions with her to see whether some therapeu­
tic relationship might be possible. 
In the first meeting with the psychologist, Tony described his 
rage with his father, adding that he would like to murder him. He 
was filled with anger and talked venomously about other young 
people who, he felt, had been set against him and were all 
ridiculing him behind his back. He was enraged by the rather

rage with his father, adding that he would like to murder him. He 
was filled with anger and talked venomously about other young 
people who, he felt, had been set against him and were all 
ridiculing him behind his back. He was enraged by the rather 

326 / Developmental Perspectives 
minimal rules of the unit and said that he refused to fit in with 
the stupid ward timetable for meals, meetings, and so on. The 
psychologist gently suggested that if he felt he was hated so 
much, it was not surprising he preferred to do things alone, but 
he also seemed to be lonely. He talked about how he had never 
been able to make friends. The psychologist reported Tony's wish 
to kill his father to the staff team, but as he seemed to be settling 
in, he was kept on the open unit under closer observation. 
His next session was in the afternoon, two days later. That 
morning Elaine had seriously slashed her wrists and had been 
taken out of the unit on a stretcher. Tony came to his session 
clearly agitated, blaming the staff for failing to protect Elaine. 
His anger quickly engulfed the interview-room, and he became 
menacing. He grabbed the psychologist's keys from the table, 
locked the interview-room door from the inside, and shoved the 
keys down his shirt and into his pants. His excitement was 
obvious as he taunted the psychologist that she had to get the 
keys back. She asked him to give them back to her and then sit 
down and talk about how he felt and what had happened, but it 
was clear that he was very excited by feeling he had her at his 
mercy and he was not going to give up that position willingly. He 
pushed her and repeatedly said that she would have to reach 
into his pants to get her keys. She pressed the alarm button and 
explained to him that this meant staff would come and be 
available outside the door to help; however, it would be much 
better if he would return the keys and continue the session 
without needing to bring other people in. He unfastened his 
pants as though to give her the keys, but then exposed himself 
to her and got more excited, pushing her against a window away 
from the panic button and trying to take her clothes off. Two 
male members of staff came into the room. 
Tony was grabbed and dragged away with his pants round his 
knees, through the main unit room where the other residents 
and staff were gathering for tea. When interviewed, Tony aggres­
sively claimed that the psychologist had "had it coming to her," 
but he also wanted to make sure that she would see him for 
the planned sessions. He was told that this would not happen 
because he would be moved that day to the high-security adult Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 327 
unit—a place dreaded by all the young people in the unit. He was 
also given a forcible injection and placed in extended "time out" 
while the transfer was arranged. 
Tony broke his window and abseiled out of the unit. The 
police were unable to find him for 24 hours, when they were 
called to his parents' home by his mother. Tony had broken in 
during the night and had stabbed his father to death. He was 
committed for an indefinite period to a maximum-security psy^ 
chiatric hospital. 
Tony had not been neglected. He had not been beaten by his 
parents (although he was extensively bullied at school), and the 
murder was triggered by an incident that occurred in a relatively 
caring setting. We would like to suggest (as we have argued more 
fully elsewhere—Fonagy and Target 1995) that, although Tony 
was not neglected physically, at the level of emotional experience 
and development of self-organization he was. Neither his mother, 
with her excessive devotion—which seemed to serve her own 
needs not to separate—nor his father, with his anger and jeal­
ousy, was actually able to relate to Tony as himself. They could 
not relate to his real feelings and experiences, and this absence 
of recognition by the attachment figures generated a vulnerabil­
ity to conduct disorder and violence. 
Excessive closeness, like excessive distance, undermines the 
psychological self. In vain does the infant try to find representa­
tions corresponding to his internal state in the expression of the 
caregiver. The self remains incompletely organized, and internal 
reality continues to be experienced in the "psychic equivalence" 
mode. It is thus vulnerable to the introjection of later malign 
experience. 
Tony was not a bright boy. He was cruelly teased by his 
peers for being slow, clumsy, odd-looking, and unkempt. Such 
teasing may seem minor to the adults surrounding the child 
and even to other children, who are capable of adopting a men­
talizing perspective. But bullying is experienced as literally 
lethal to those children who cannot distinguish a feeling of 
humiliation from obliteration. A similar sense of ego-destructive 
shame accompanied Tony's experience of thinly veiled violence

minimal rules of the unit and said that he refused to fit in with 
the stupid ward timetable for meals, meetings, and so on. The 
psychologist gently suggested that if he felt he was hated so 
much, it was not surprising he preferred to do things alone, but 
he also seemed to be lonely. He talked about how he had never 
been able to make friends. The psychologist reported Tony's wish 
to kill his father to the staff team, but as he seemed to be settling 
in, he was kept on the open unit under closer observation. 
His next session was in the afternoon, two days later. That 
morning Elaine had seriously slashed her wrists and had been 
taken out of the unit on a stretcher. Tony came to his session 
clearly agitated, blaming the staff for failing to protect Elaine. 
His anger quickly engulfed the interview-room, and he became 
menacing. He grabbed the psychologist's keys from the table, 
locked the interview-room door from the inside, and shoved the 
keys down his shirt and into his pants. His excitement was 
obvious as he taunted the psychologist that she had to get the 
keys back. She asked him to give them back to her and then sit 
down and talk about how he felt and what had happened, but it 
was clear that he was very excited by feeling he had her at his 
mercy and he was not going to give up that position willingly. He 
pushed her and repeatedly said that she would have to reach 
into his pants to get her keys. She pressed the alarm button and 
explained to him that this meant staff would come and be 
available outside the door to help; however, it would be much 
better if he would return the keys and continue the session 
without needing to bring other people in. He unfastened his 
pants as though to give her the keys, but then exposed himself 
to her and got more excited, pushing her against a window away 
from the panic button and trying to take her clothes off. Two 
male members of staff came into the room. 
Tony was grabbed and dragged away with his pants round his 
knees, through the main unit room where the other residents 
and staff were gathering for tea. When interviewed, Tony aggres­
sively claimed that the psychologist had "had it coming to her," 
but he also wanted to make sure that she would see him for 
the planned sessions. He was told that this would not happen 
because he would be moved that day to the high-security adult Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 327

mother, he felt abused himself and powerless to prevent his or 
his mother's suffering. This aroused the same sense of helpless 
shameful humiliation from which he could escape only through 
identification with the aggression. In the context of the incom­
plete self-organization that is the residue of disorganized attach­

It is the dissociated, alien part of the self that accommodates to

The tragic consequence for Tony, as for other children whose 
experience of relative neglect is followed by brutalization, is 
that a part of the self has become a destroyer of the rest. Given

relationships with paranoia, the coherence of the self could only 
be restored by externalization. In disorganized attachment gen­
erally, the externalization may be of something that is not de­
structive, and the result may simply be a controlling style of 
interaction. Where this disorganization has been followed at 
some point by brutalization, violence to self or other is likely. The 
alien self is so persecutory that its projection is a much more 
urgent and constant task. Any threat to self-esteem triggers this 
externalization, which can, in turn trigger an attack in the hope 
of destroying the alien other. 
Let us revisit the sequence of events that culminated in 
Tony's murder of his father. Notwithstanding his surly behavior, 
Tony was relieved to be in the adolescent unit. He then found 
two women who, he felt, -understood him. Feeling understood 
brought forward inarticulate but intense affection and hopeful­
ness. Their consideration toward him aroused feelings of love 
and need to be loved, which he could not titrate—either inter­
nally or externally—appropriately to the situation. Often when 
we consider the deficit in affect regulation in these cases, we 
focus on the difficulty in containing negative affects, forgetting 
that the same difficulty applies to positive feelings when they are 
aroused. Losing the hope of love, he felt humiliated, and this 
experience in turn triggered his aggression. His sexual assault 
on the psychologist was at one level an act of self-protection. He 
arrived feeling threatened and frightened by Elaine's disappear-Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 329 
ance, and the only way he could express his love and need was 
by first externalizing his alien self, filled with fear and helpless­
ness, into the psychologist. While holding her hostage, his affec­
tion and gratitude could be (clumsily) shown. Once the dis­
continuity in his self-representation had been dealt with, he was 
almost able to express affection. Sadly, it could only be done 
while maintaining this threatening posture. He destroyed the 
possibility of being accepted by his desperate defensive maneu­
ver—the psychologist who had been able to see him and to show 
understanding was now bringing further humiliation on him. 
She responded to his taunting by calling for help: understand­
able and probably necessary, but for him a double loss. We can 
imagine that Tony may have felt that she first lost sight of his 
gentler and more loving side, then saw only the menacing pos­
ture, apparently relating to that (as in psychic equivalence) as 
the only reality. To destroy the vision of him in her mind as evil, 
he would have felt that she had to be attacked. 
The rest of the story demonstrates with tragic inevitability 
what can so often happen when institutions—always prone to 
mindlessness, even'with the best of intentions—attempt to con­
tain a person struggling to achieve mentalizing. The incident 
created some panic and much guilt about having exposed a 
trainee to this danger, and all the participants responded by 
belatedly showing their support for her, meting out an excessive, 
ego-destructive punishment. No one, in the rather chaotic after­
math of the incident, communicated an understanding of Tony's 
actions and the feelings of loss and love contained in them. He 
was alone with the memory of his complete humiliation in front 
of his peers, the irreversible loss of his hopes of closeness, and 
the terror of an environment far more mindless than the one he 
was already finding excruciating. 
We can speculate about how this state of mind led to murder.

their destruction generated the illusion that he could attain

These feelings were not far from his conscious awareness. 
When visited by the adolescent-unit psychologist in the maxi­
mum-security hospital, Tony was able to talk about his hope for 
(an idealized) union with his mother now that his father was out 
of the way. Perhaps a deeper, unconscious hope, however, 
was for a separation from her, which his act of murder clearly 
achieved. Just as the unit's authority probably represented the 
father, so the possibility of understanding and closeness per­
haps reminded him of the maddening seductiveness of intimacy 
with his mother. He may have hoped that, separated from her, 
he might rediscover a coherent sense of self, even a genuinely 
understanding attachment relationship. Sadly, he found instead 
a place where mentalization tended to be eroded still further. 
Discussion 
In what senses was Tony's predicament characteristic of adoles­
cence? Tony's violence, always present, became increasingly 
lethal from the time he reached puberty. His "symbiotic relation­
ship" with his mother had disguised the extent to which he used 
her as a vehicle for his experience of his own mental states. His 
father, in a far more destructive way, performed the same func­
tion in enabling him to externalize his hatred and revulsion and 
place himself in the role of protector. Longer periods away from 
his parents made this difficult to sustain. His enactments had to 
become increasingly dramatic to achieve the changes in affect in 
his parents necessary for his self to feel coherent. As in a 
conversation, the voices must get louder as the speakers move 
farther apart. Paradoxically, this resulted in an even greater 
separation: his placement in the care of social services, creating 
the claustrophobic anxiety described by John Steiner (1993) and 
before that by Herbert Rosenfeld (1987). The terror was that the 
alien part of the self would be trapped forever, with no possibility 
for externalization. This drove Tony to the desperation so charac­

Glen2 started his analysis in a profoundly dissociated state. 
Although he was 15, he had the appearance of a 10-year-old and 
behaved like a child half that age. He just sat in a chair, with­
drawn, angry, and depressed, huddled up in a tentlike coat that 
was far too big for his small stature; sometimes he hid his face in 
his hands, occasionally looking at me through a gap he made 
between his fingers. There was immense hostility in the room, 
and a sense of uncontained confusion. There were sessions 
when he was able to talk, and at these times the infantile nature 
of his mental functioning was revealed in a stark and disturbing 
way. Glen's clinical diagnosis would have been obsessive-com­
pulsive disorder, together with a major depression. Such labels 
cannot, however, adequately convey the word and thought magic 
that had overtaken his life. His life was organized around rituals 
from the moment he got up and had to tidy his room in a 
particular order—sometimes repeatedly if he felt he might have 
got the order wrong—to the moment he got into bed, when he 
had to place his pillows at certain angles to the room and to his 
body. On the surface, he wished to avoid "bad luck," but it was 
easy to see that underneath was a dread of intrusive ideas, 
concretized as alien beings, spiders, and bacteria. He was terror­
ized by the continuously intrusive thought that the creature 
from the film Alien was in the fireplace or in the garden. He was 
also oppressed by his aggressive fantasies and his constant 
dread that any spontaneous action on his part might bring harm 
to someone else. 
There was little in Glen's background to justify his state of 
mind. His father was an authoritarian man who certainly lacked

relationship with Glen's father as deeply troubled. The trigger for 
Glen's difficulties may have been his mother's chronic illness 
and consequent surgery. It was difficult to know how to under­
stand Glen's difficulties; he seemed relatively bright, and in 
some ways even talented, but embattled in a constant struggle 
against a regressive pull in order to contain intense destructive 
fantasies. His symptoms had been intensifying rapidly before his 
referral for treatment, and he was terrified that he was going 
mad. 
I was at a loss as to how to help Glen. I did interpretive work 
with little success; I focused on his fear of me confusing him and 
causing him to become mad, his terror of my aggression toward 
him and of his toward me, his sense that his parents had 
abandoned him with me, having given up on him, his hopeless­
ness about himself and me, his isolation outside the treatment, 
which he showed me concretely inside the room, his fear that 
talking would break his tenuous control over his mind, and so 
on. None of these interpretations had any apparent effect; I was 
not getting through to him. I became angry and found it quite 
hard to resist the temptation to give up on him. I blamed others: 
the diagnostic team for not screening him adequately, his par­
ents for not recognizing his difficulties, but above all Glen for 
remaining inaccessible and making me so helpless. 
About two and a half months into the treatment, around the 
Christmas break, I decided to change tack. I abandoned some of 
my formal interpretive style with him and became livelier, almost 
trying to persuade him out of his passive-aggressive stance. I 
started making jokes and humored him about his feelings of 
anger with me and his wish to kill me so I would stop bothering 
him "once and for all." I imitated his behavior, showing him 
rather than telling him how he appeared to me. I chatted to him 
about my messy room and how I thought he disliked it but didn't 
want to say so in case I would be offended. On a wet morning we 
talked about him being cross about getting wet, just so he could 
come and be bored by me for 50 minutes. I talked to him about 
his wonderful feeling of liberation when it came to the Christmas 
break from analysis. On another occasion, when he mentioned a 
teacher of his who was bald, he inadvertently glanced at me, and I said to him how pleased he must feel that he had hair and I 
didn't, and how ridiculous he thought I looked. 
Happily, this change of strategy began to bear fruit. Slowly he 
became visibly more relaxed, his posture changed, he took his 
coat off. He also opened up verbally and told me about what 
turned out to be crucial anxieties, particularly about work. He 
shared his worries about not being able to do his homework, his 
wish to be appreciated by his teachers, and the dread that he 
might disappoint them. I was able to interpret what must have 
been a dominant feature of the transference all along, the ter­
rible feeling of disappointing me if he let himself care what I 
thought and felt about him. 
The atmosphere changed. Glen started looking at me, and 
there were fewer periods of long silence. He began to talk about 
his thoughts and feelings when he had been withdrawn. He had 
imagined that he was throwing knives into my body or just 
missing me, loving the feeling of control and torture. He gave me 
room to interpret that his fear of my power over him could be 
related to his wish to control and frighten me; that he wished to 
destroy people because he was so afraid of them, but his anger 
was so clear that it frightened him and made him feel terribly 
guilty. He was increasingly grateful for my interpretations and 
almost seemed pleased to see me. By the end of the six-month 
period a therapeutic alliance had developed where I was seen as 
both useful and, on the whole, benign. The major transference 
theme, however, remained the same—that I could not contain 
and tolerate his rage and mad thoughts; the tiniest and most 
subtle shift in my stance could lead to immense anxiety and 
could trigger withdrawal from me. I felt that our work had 
begun. 
Over the next year he made increasingly good use of the 
analysis and improved symptomatically in ways that both he 
and his parents clearly noticed. For example, the rituals ceased 
to preoccupy him, and his obsessional work patterns gave way to 
a far more relaxed but still organized attitude. There were several 
key points. The first was our joint recognition of the significance 
of his early period at school, when he had been regarded as a 
slow learner and offered remedial teaching. He had found the

shared his worries about not being able to do his homework, his 
wish to be appreciated by his teachers, and the dread that he 
might disappoint them. I was able to interpret what must have 
been a dominant feature of the transference all along, the ter­
rible feeling of disappointing me if he let himself care what I 
thought and felt about him. 
The atmosphere changed. Glen started looking at me, and 
there were fewer periods of long silence. He began to talk about 
his thoughts and feelings when he had been withdrawn. He had 
imagined that he was throwing knives into my body or just 
missing me, loving the feeling of control and torture. He gave me 
room to interpret that his fear of my power over him could be 
related to his wish to control and frighten me; that he wished to 
destroy people because he was so afraid of them, but his anger 
was so clear that it frightened him and made him feel terribly 
guilty. He was increasingly grateful for my interpretations and 
almost seemed pleased to see me. By the end of the six-month 
period a therapeutic alliance had developed where I was seen as 
both useful and, on the whole, benign. The major transference 
theme, however, remained the same—that I could not contain 
and tolerate his rage and mad thoughts; the tiniest and most 
subtle shift in my stance could lead to immense anxiety and 
could trigger withdrawal from me. I felt that our work had 
begun. 
Over the next year he made increasingly good use of the 
analysis and improved symptomatically in ways that both he 
and his parents clearly noticed. For example, the rituals ceased 
to preoccupy him, and his obsessional work patterns gave way to 
a far more relaxed but still organized attitude. There were several 
key points. The first was our joint recognition of the significance 
of his early period at school, when he had been regarded as a 
slow learner and offered remedial teaching. He had found the 

334 / Developmental Perspectives Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 335 
experience humiliating, not least because of the exceptionally 
high performance of his older brother and his father's thinly 
disguised mockery. As we recognized that his obsessional work 
patterns reflected his conflict over wishing to avoid educational 
humiliation on the one hand, and his anger with both his 
parents, his brother, and his teachers for mocking him on the 
other, his attitude toward his work changed. He stopped forcing 
himself to do the same piece of work half a dozen times; instead, 
he decided to work only a certain number of hours after he came 
home from school, and he stopped worrying about work accu­
mulating. 
His self-esteem took a boost when his fear of his sadism 
entered the material. This was triggered by a school visit to the 
film Schindler's List, which he had wanted to avoid. He was 
greatly disturbed by the film and eventually disclosed that he 
had fantasized being the Camp Commandant who was using 
Jewish workers for target practice. This quickly led to the elabo­
ration of these fantasies and to a shameful disclosure that he 
constantly fantasized about attacking people and killing them in 
painful ways. We talked at some length about his enjoyment of 
the fantasy of torturing me, and he described the various ways 
he had thought of causing me pain, particularly enjoying the 
idea of my begging for mercy. Interestingly, this linked with 
Glen's neurotic concern about his father's moods. He was wor­
ried that his father shut himself off in his study, particularly 
after he had been subjected to playful teasing by his family. 
He feared that his father might commit suicide, and he dreaded 
both being blamed and blaming himself. Historical material 
emerged about his experience of his father's sensitivity and 
current and past thoughts about the fragility of his parents' 
marriage. Eventually it transpired that his concern was far 
greater about his mother's depression than about his father's. It 
seemed that his mother terrified him by retiring to bed, some­
times as early as 6 p.m., leaving the children to look after 
themselves. His fears about my fragility suddenly made more 
sense to both of us, and he told me how reassured he had been 
when he realized "that you can take a joke." He became increas­
ingly relaxed in the sessions: he would sit slouched in the chair, play games at my expense, mock my room, mimic my habits, 
and comment on my baldness and my monotonous clothes. In 
the transference I seemed to become a predepressed mother, and 
he visibly enjoyed this. Other clinicians working at the center 
noted the change in him: unbeknown to me, he was walking 
down the stairs whistling. 
About twelve months into the treatment he began to trust me 
with his sexual secrets. It transpired that he had reached sexual 
maturation and had started masturbating to ejaculation. He was 
excited by pictures of naked women. He felt deeply ashamed 
about this and wondered if I would refuse to see him after he 
disclosed his practices. Part of the fear of the Alien was clearly 
linked to a split-off aspect of his sadistic sexual wishes. His 
aggression permeated his sexuality. The excitement of guns, 
pain in others, and sexual pleasure appeared to be confused in 
his mind. My acceptance of these fantasies led to an immense 
sense of relief, and he started thinking about asking girls out. 
An extract from a session may illustrate his progress. I had 
canceled the previous Friday's session, and he came on Monday 
depressed, having had a "bad weekend." He told me about a 
school fireworks party where he wandered around feeling lonely; 
also, he told me about feeling overwhelmed by the amount of 
homework he had to do; and he ended by saying he was "really 
pissed off." I made an attempt to link his loneliness and his sense 
of being overwhelmed to the canceled session, and he responded 
that he knew I would say that, and he scathingly wondered why 
it took a trained analyst to spot that he was feeling depressed. He 
claimed that he had actually enjoyed Friday, particularly not 
having to get up early, but immediately went on to talk about the 
school party and his father's pathetic attempts at cheering him 
up. But the real problem was that he didn't have any friends. I 
said that I thought my canceling the session must have felt to 
him as if I too wasn't really his friend, and the analysis was no 
more than a pathetic attempt at trying to cheer him up. He 
talked in a sad way about walking about at the party, finding no 
one to talk to, and then, in a derogatory way, about boys rushing 
around squirting each other with water pistols; even fireworks 
weren't as good as they used to be. He thought his father had

weren't as good as they used to be. He thought his father had 

336 / Developmental Perspectives 
had a good time talking to other parents. He had listened for a 
while but decided that they, too, were stupid. 
I took up his disappointment with me and the pain of being 
excluded: that he wasn't good enough, just like the fireworks. He 
went back to talking about work. He was really worried, he said, 
about his work not being good enough, about being perfection-
istic and then getting behind. Then he mentioned the clown at 
the party, who had followed him about; he was quite distressed 
as he described trying to get away from him and all the revelry 
going on around him. I said that I thought he felt mocked by the 
party, just like he felt mocked by my claimed interest in him and 
by his father's attempt to cheer him up. None of these felt 
genuine, and.he was feeling really pissed off by the thought that 
I had been mocking him secretly all along. He agreed; he said 
he felt ridiculous and had not wanted to come to see me this 
morning. There was a long tirade about his pet-hate subject-
photography. He complained that he should have shot a roll of 
film this weekend and described his struggles to get some work 
done for his project. He gave a clue about the nature of his 
inhibition about taking pictures when he mentioned his feeling 
that his photography teacher only liked taking pictures of girls. 
I suggested that maybe he was frightened that I would mock or 
ridicule his interest in girls, yet perhaps he wouldn't mind taking 
pictures of girls if he had the opportunity. The tirade about the 
photography teacher continued with increased ferocity—he was 
a "real lecherous bastard," he only gave adequate teaching to 
girls, yet he was fat and ugly. They called him "Fat Sam the 
blow-job man." I said that I thought it was very hard for him 
because he felt so guilty about not really being able to set aside 
his interest in pictures of girls, and that every other task, includ­
ing the analysis, seemed overwhelming. 
He went on< to describe his struggle with himself over not 
wanting to masturbate during the weekend until he had finished 
his homework; ultimately he lost the struggle and gave in, but he 
felt terrible about it. But that wasn't the same as the teacher— 
"He should be able to control his interest, he's sixty, for goodness 
sake," that's why he hated him. I said that perhaps he had 
wondered if I had not canceled Friday's session because I was Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 337 
not able to put my work with him above my interest in girls. He 
laughed and said that perhaps he would call me Sam from now 
on. But he added that he found it very disturbing to think of 
adults having sexual interests; then he talked of his father being 
away a lot recently. I said tentatively that perhaps there was 
something about his parents' sexuality that disturbed him. 
He was relieved and replied: "I'm glad you mentioned it first." 
Over the weekend he had overheard his parents arguing about 
sex; it seemed to him that his mother didn't want to have sex 
with his father any more. He was worried that they would start 
fighting or that his mother would leave. He said that he hated 
his father, that he could be a real shit sometimes. I said that I 
understood how upsetting and confusing overhearing his par­
ents' conversation must have been, that perhaps he just wanted 
to walk away from it like he did from his father's excited discus­
sions at the party, because it made him hate a part of himself so 
much. I wanted to add that sometimes he was afraid of growing 
up, in case he would grow into a man like his father, but he said: 
"Do you think I'll turn into a little shit like my father when I grow 
up?" 
I said that I thought that what he was describing was a 
terrible trap he felt he was in, between feeling like a little boy 
who was isolated and abandoned, who could be ridiculed be­
cause he only had a water pistol not a proper penis, or feeling he 
would grow up and be like Fat Sam, whose sexuality was a 
subject of ridicule as well as resentment and hatred. There 
seemed no alternative, no possibility of being just an ordinary 
man. He said rather sadly that he didn't think he'd ever have a 
girl friend, that nobody would want him. I added that that was 
part of it, but he was also frightened that somebody might. He 
said that was very true. The session ended with Glen leaving 
much cheered but adding, on his way out: "I still haven't forgiven 
you for last Friday, though." 
Glen's analysis was completed in three and a half years. 
During this time anxieties about performance in exams, mastur­
bation, and other aspects of sexuality emerged, as would be 
developmentally expected. His obsessional rituals either stopped 
or they no longer bothered him. His exam performance was very

Discussion 
Glen's problems resolved quickly, not just through addressing 
his unconscious conflicts but through being given space to play 
with feelings and ideas. The analytic setting allowed him once 
again to bring together his two modes of experiencing inner 
reality. He had withdrawn from the complexity of interpersonal 
relations into his tentlike coat, apparently unable to think. Yet 
his difficulty was rooted in a hyperactivity of mentalizing brought 
forth by his developmental leap. The leap had thrown him back 
into a mode of psychic equivalence that made the contents of his 
mind terrifying to him but could be alleviated by the analyst's 
scaffolding. Glen had known that thoughts were only thoughts 
and feelings were only feelings, but the preoccupation with the 
complexity of his own and his parents' feelings, which he had 
discovered in adolescence, defeated him, and he took refuge in a 
mental state that does not recognize the nature of psychic real­
ity. Just like the 2Tyear-old who escapes into pretend in order to 
avoid the terror that psychic equivalence generates, so Glen, like 
many adolescents, retreated into a state of dissociation. His 
obsessionality was a more direct expression of psychic equiva­
lence; however, it was not characterological, and it disappeared 
simultaneously with the return of mentalization. 
There are many differences between the cases of Tony and 
Glen, but one feature in particular concerns us here. While both 
Tony and Glen experienced a regression to a dual mode of 
mental functioning, only in Tony's case did this reveal a destruc­
tive and hostile alien self. Both were immensely vulnerable to 
humiliation and shame because of the return of psychic equiva­
lence. Only in Tony, who had been far more brutalized by earlier 
experiences, did this shame become ego-destructive. The power 
of externalization (projective identification) was intense in both 
patients, and this may indeed be a feature in most adolescent Developmental Issues in Adolescence / 339 
analyses given the pressures for separateness to which we re­
ferred above. In Glen's case the externalization of his alien self 
left a more mature and intact structure, which needed little by 
way of external support. The challenge of trying to treat someone 
like Tony is that not only is the therapist required to accept the 
externalization without which the patient is unable to relate, but 
that having become what the patient needs her to be, she is 
required to provide scaffolding and support, recognition of the 
patient's true (even loving) self. To do this while reflecting the 
terror that the patient needs to see outside and fending off 
physical assault is more than can be asked of most therapists. 
So how can we cope with regressed adolescent patients? The 
patients we are considering experience very deep anxieties about 
the self being overwhelmed, because the parent is no longer 
there to have an archaic image of herself projected back onto 
her. Technique has to take account of this. Accepting projec­
tions, often initially without interpretation, may be particularly 
important. One is likely to be made into a good, bad, valued, and 
hated figure, to be transported at magical speeds and unpredict­
ably through a massive intrapsychic terrain. There is a constant 
search for alternative figures to serve as hosts for the alien self, 
which gives rise to the apparent "promiscuity" of these adoles­
cents. Sadly, most people are not accepting of their projections, 
and experiences of profound rejection tend to dog these young 
people. 
One technical difficulty is likely to be that the more real 
something feels to the patient, the more it is to talk about, 
because it feels like a primitive, concrete experience that can 
only be managed in physical ways. The things that feel real can 
be apparently trivial experiences, particularly in the transfer­
ence, which can feel entirely unbearable, and if the analyst 
approaches those things, there can be dramatic ruptures to the 
alliance. There may be bizarre demands for concrete solutions, 
which it is tempting to interpret in terms of more ordinary 
transference. 
Analytic help needs to be offered in a way that is consistent 
with the developmental challenges of this stage, facilitating the 
forward movement toward an autonomous identity. This occurs

through a process that is analogous to playing with a young 
child, helping the adolescent to represent and manage his 
mental states psychologically rather than physically. This has 
to take place alongside the patient's efforts to re-find an external 
vehicle, through the transference, for intolerable aspects of his 
earliest relationships. PART III 
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES 
In part III, we extend our analysis of case material from children 
and adolescents to adults, illustrating the theoretical and 
developmental views we have introduced. We have two chapters 
on serious character pathology, focusing on cases of borderline 
personality disorder, demonstrating how this pathology has its 
source in the failure of mentalization and in problems with 
sustaining the intentional stance. We also propose the notion of 
an alien self to account for intolerable disturbances in the sense 
of identity in these patients, the vulnerability to self-harm, and 
the fact that attachment is both desperately needed and rapidly 
unbearable, including in the therapeutic relationship. In chapter 
11, we broaden our focus to include four case studies of adults, 
ranging from relatively mild to severe psychopathology. In this 
chapter, we describe the processing of affects through mentaliza­
tion—what we term "mentalized affectivity," Finally, the clinical 
material shows what mentalized affectivity is and how it can be 
enhanced in and by psychotherapy.

in Disorganized Attachment 
THE ATTACHMENT SYSTEM AND THE DISTORTION 
OF INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS 
IN PERSONALITY DISORDER 
There have been many attempts in the past to illuminate the 
symptomatology of borderline personality disorder using attach­
ment theory. Implicitly or explicitly, Bowlby's suggestion that 
early experience with the caregiver serves to organize later at­
tachment relationships has been used in explanations of psycho-
pathology in BPD. For example, it has been suggested that the 
borderline person's experiences of interpersonal attack, neglect, 
and threats of abandonment may account for a perception 
of current relationships as attacking and neglectful (Benjamin 
1993). Others have suggested that borderline individuals are 
specifically characterized by a fearful and preoccupied attach­
ment style reflecting "an emotional template of intimacy anxiety/ 
anger" (Dutton, Saunders, Starzomski, and Bartholomew 1994). 
In studies of AAI narratives of borderline patients, the classifica­
tion of "preoccupied" is most frequently assigned (Fonagy et al. 
1996) and, within this, the "confused," "fearful," and "over­
whelmed" subclassification appears to be most common (Patrick 
343 

344 / Clinical Perspectives 
et al. 1994). Not surprisingly, such patients also tend to be 
unresolved with regard to their experience of trauma or abuse. 
Past attempts at linking work on attachment with theories of 
borderline pathology have stressed the common characteristic 
shared by the ambivalently attached /preoccupied and border­
line groups "to check for proximity, signaling to establish contact 
by pleading or other calls for attention or help, and clinging 
behaviors" (Gunderson 1996). Gunderson highlights the theme 
of intolerance of aloneness and terror of abandonment in such 
patients, which has been claimed to account for many of the 
clinical features observed in this group of patients. Consistent 
with this view is the lack of stable representation of the other 
and the use of the therapist as a transitional object, an exten­
sion of the patient, who lacks separate identity and feelings 
(Modell 1963). Transitional relatedness in these patients is 
marked by histories of using transitional objects (Morris, Gun­
derson, and Zanarini 1986) as well as bringing such objects to 
hospital more frequently than patients with other psychiatric 
disorders (Cardasis, Hochman, and Silk 1997). 
However, directly applied, normative observations of attach­
ment in infancy are probably insufficient to provide an account 
of the behavior of borderline patients. There is no doubt that 
borderline individuals are insecure in their attachment, but for 
several reasons descriptions of insecure attachment from in­
fancy or adulthood provide an inadequate clinical account: 
[a] Anxious attachment is very common; in working-class sam­
ples the majority of children are anxiously attached (Broussard 
1995). (b) Anxious patterns of attachment in infancy correspond 
to relatively stable adult strategies (Main et al. 1985), yet the 
hallmark of the disordered attachments of borderline individuals 
is the absence of stability (Higgitt and Fonagy 1992). (c) While the 
angry protests of the resistant infant may seem to provide 
a challenging analogy for the pervasively aggressive stance in 
interpersonal relationships of the borderline individual (Dutton 
et al. 1994), the clinical presentation of borderline patients 
frequently includes a violent attack on the patient's own body or 
that of another human being. It is likely that the propensity for 
such violence must include an additional component, which • Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 345 
predisposes such individuals to act upon bodies rather than 
upon minds, and indeed it is this very inadequacy in their 
capacity to represent aggression-related attachment ideation 
mentally that may place them at risk of violent acts in the 
context of intimate interpersonal relationships (Fonagy and Tar­
get 1995b). 
There is some evidence of a specific link between childhood 
maltreatment—particularly childhood sexual abuse—and bor­
derline personality disorder (Paris, Zweig-Frank, and Guzder 
1993). As children, such individuals frequently had caregivers 
who were themselves within the so-called borderline spectrum 
of severe personality disorder (Shachnow et al. 1997). Many 
writers have criticized the term "borderline" as too imprecise, but 
most continue to find it useful. It may be helpful to clarify the 
clinical phenomena that we shall be discussing. There are two 
main psychoanalytic uses of the term, one rooted in psychiatry 
(e.g., Kernberg 1987) and the other rooted in psychoanalytic 
clinical practice. Here we are concerned with the second of these 
meanings; furthermore, the model described here is intended to 
explain borderline phenomena in many patients, not simply 
those who fulfill diagnostic criteria of borderline personality 
disorder. Although we refer to borderline patients, we are there­
fore not referring to the diagnostic group. Our aim is to elucidate 
the mental functioning of a larger group of patients whose think­
ing and affective experience become massively disorganized in 
the clinical setting as well as elsewhere. Clinical descriptions of 
borderline phenomena (e.g., Rey 1979) are of individuals who 
regress dramatically in psychoanalytic treatment, showing psy­
chotic-like phenomena, and who evoke intense feelings in the 
analyst. These feelings, in combination with the patient's intense 
emotional lability, create a troubled and troublesome analytic 
process. Their journey through analysis is marked by transfer­
ence and often countertransference enactments, with periods of 
intense dependence punctuated by ruptures of the treatment 
process. Analysis tends to be prolonged and limited in its re­
sults. This chapter is intended to be integrative, in that we aim 
to account for the experience of borderline patients within the 
analytic relationship by providing not so much a new clinical

description, but more a developmental perspective on the ego 
mechanisms underlying these phenomena. We also offer some 
technical suggestions that seem to us to follow from an under­
standing of the developmental roots of these patients' difficulties. 
We have proposed that some personality-disordered individu­
als are those victims of childhood abuse who coped by refusing 
to conceive of their attachment figure's thoughts and thus 
avoided having to think about their caregiver's wish to harm 
them (Fonagy, Leigh, et al. 1996). There is accumulating evi­
dence that maltreatment impairs the child's reflective capacities 
and sense of self. Schneider-Rosen and Cicchetti (1984, 1991) 
noted that abused toddlers showed less positive affect on recog­
nizing themselves in the mirror than did controls. Beeghly and 
Cicchetti (1994) showed that these toddlers had a specific deficit 
in the use of internal-state words and that such language tended 
to be context-bound. Our Menninger study of maltreated 5- to 8-
year-olds found specific deficits in tasks requiring mentalization, 
particularly among those referred for sexual or physical abuse. 
These results suggest that maltreatment may cause children to 
withdraw from the mental world. Continuing defensively to dis­
rupt their capacity to depict mental states in themselves and in 
others leaves them operating on inaccurate, schematic impres­
sions of thoughts and feelings. They are then immensely vulner­
able in intimate relationships. There are two propositions here: 
[a] individuals who experience early trauma may defensively 
inhibit their capacity to mentalize; and (b) some characteristics 
of personality disorder may be rooted in this inhibition. 
In this chapter, we consider a limited set of symptoms and 
personality characteristics found in BPD in the light of these 
propositions: (a) disorganized and dysfunctional self-organiza­
tion and consequent problems in affect regulation and emotional 
self-control (including feelings of emptiness, lack of a stable 
sense of self, emotional instability, and impulsivity); (b) dysfunc­
tional and distorting "social-reality-testing" abilities: the domi­
nance of defensive modes of functioning in intimate relationships 
and in the analytic transference characterized by splitting and 
projective identification; (c) vulnerability to trauma, serious diffi­
culties in maintaining intimate attachment relations, proneness 
to provoke abandonment, and consequent suicidality. We will Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 347 
show how the developmental theory we have advanced in previ­
ous chapters can shed light on the symptomatology of BPD. 
ATTACHMENT EXPERIENCES AS DETERMINANTS 
OF CAPACITIES FOR SOCIAL COGNITION 
To deepen our understanding of the relation of attachment and 
BPD, let us consider the question of how the transgenerational 
transmission of attachment may be mediated. Genetics may 
seem to provide an obvious explanation. However, the early 
findings of an ongoing twin study in our laboratory have yielded 
no evidence of differential levels of concordance of attachment 
classification between identical and nonidentical twins (Fonagy, 
Fearon, and Target 1999). Attachment theorists have assumed 
that securely attached adults are more sensitive to their chil­
dren's needs, thus fostering an expectation in the infant that 
dysregulation will be rapidly and effectively met (Belsky et al. 
1995; De Wolff and van IJzendoorn 1997). Disappointingly, stan­
dard measures of caregiver sensitivity do not appear to explain 
transgenerational consistencies in attachment classification at 
all well (van Uzendoom 1995). 
An alternative account of the crucial mediator of attachment 
security is provided by Mary Main (1991) and Inge Bretherton 
(1991a), who independently drew attention to Daniel Dennett's 
concept of the "intentional stance," which has been a core con­
struct in this monograph as well (see chapters 3-5). As we have 
described, Dennett (1987) theorized that humans have evolved a 
mentalistic interpretational system that he calls the "intentional 
stance," whose function is efficiently to predict and explain other 
people's actions by inferring and attributing causal intentional 
mind states (such as beliefs, intentions, and desires) to them. 
This system implies an understanding that behavior can be 
caused by representational mental states that can be either true 
or false in relation to actual reality. Since intentional mind 
states (such as beliefs) are not directly visible, they need to be 
inferred from a variety of behavioral and situational cues that 
the interpreter needs to monitor constantly. The ability to

(1991a), who independently drew attention to Daniel Dennett's 
concept of the "intentional stance," which has been a core con­
struct in this monograph as well (see chapters 3-5). As we have 
described, Dennett (1987) theorized that humans have evolved a 
mentalistic interpretational system that he calls the "intentional 
stance," whose function is efficiently to predict and explain other 
people's actions by inferring and attributing causal intentional

states (such as beliefs) are not directly visible, they need to be 
inferred from a variety of behavioral and situational cues that 
the interpreter needs to monitor constantly. The ability to 

348 / Clinical Perspectives 
mentalize, which can be seen as the central mechanism of 
"social (or mental) reality testing," is therefore a developmental 
achievement that unfolds through the gradual sensitization to 
and learning about the mental significance of relevant expres­
sive, behavioral, verbal, and situational cues that indicate the 
presence of mind states in persons. The ability to mentalize 
affords the child a measure of protection: for example, a child 
who is confronted with an unresponsive, depressed mother is 
protected from confusion and a negative view of himself if he is 
able to hypothesize that her sadness is due to a loss. 
As we have seen, current evidence indicates that normally 
developing children only construct a relatively mature naive 
theory of mind at around 3 to 4 years of age. This is well 
illustrated by the false-belief task first developed by Wimmer and 
Perner (1983) and described in detail in chapter 5. Such studies 
indicate that although at the age of 3 years the great majority of 
children fail in tasks that require them to predict another per­
son's action based on a false belief attributed to his mind, by 4 
years of age they have usually mastered this ability. In Wimmer 
and Perner's experiment, 4-year-old children showed sensitivity 
to the situational cues that enabled them to infer that the 
experimenter would continue to act on the basis of an outdated 
false belief about reality. So by 4 years of age children can 
understand that actions are caused by mental representations of 
reality rather than by reality itself (as they see it). By this time, 
they have also learned the significance of the relevant mind-
cue—that seeing leads to knowing—that would have sanctioned 
them to attribute a change in belief to the other's mind. 
The securely attached child perceives in the caregiver's reflec­
tive stance an image of himself as desiring and believing. He sees 
that the caregiver represents him as an intentional being, and 
this representation is internalized to form the self. If the care­
giver's reflective capacity has enabled her accurately to picture 
the child's intentional stance, then the child will have the oppor­
tunity to "find himself in the other" as a mentalizing individual. 
At the core of our selves is the representation of how we were 
seen. Our reflective capacity is thus a transgenerational acquisi­
tion. We think of others in terms of desires and beliefs because— 
and to the extent that—we were thought of as intentional beings. : Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 349 
Only following this process of internalization can the develop­
ment of awareness of mental states in oneself be generalized to 
others, including the caregiver. 
ATTACHMENT AND THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE SELF 
Attachment is involved in the development of reflective function 
at three levels: 
1. We assume that the internalization of second-order repre­
sentations of internal states (self-states) depends upon the sen­
sitive reflection of the caregiver, as discussed in chapter 4. The 
child's concept of affect is not arrived at by introspection; rather, 
the caregiver's emotional expression, congruent with the child's 
state, is internalized and becomes its "representation" (Gergely 
and Watson 1996; Target and Fonagy 1996). These self-states 
become the building blocks with which a reflective internal 
working model can be constructed. The combination of the rep­
resentation of self-experience and the representation of the 
reaction of the caregiver elaborates the child's teleological model 
of the mind and ultimately enables him to interpret and under­
stand affective displays in others as well as arriving at the 
regulation and control of his own emotions. 
2. The gradual move from a teleological to an intentional stance 
is intrinsically linked to the child's experience of safety in explor­
ing the caregiver's mind to disentangle the feelings and thoughts 
that might account for the caregiver's behavior. The secure 
infant feels safe in making attributions of mental states to ac­
count for this behavior. In contrast, the avoidant child shuns the 
mental state of the other to some degree, while the resistant 
child focuses on his own state of distress, to the exclusion of 
close intersubjective exchanges. Disorganized infants may repre­
sent a special category; hypervigilant of the caregiver's behavior, 
they use all cues available for prediction and may be acutely 
sensitized to intentional states, and thus they may be more

at three levels: 
1. We assume that the internalization of second-order repre­
sentations of internal states (self-states) depends upon the sen­
sitive reflection of the caregiver, as discussed in chapter 4. The 
child's concept of affect is not arrived at by introspection; rather, 
the caregiver's emotional expression, congruent with the child's 
state, is internalized and becomes its "representation" (Gergely

is intrinsically linked to the child's experience of safety in explor­
ing the caregiver's mind to disentangle the feelings and thoughts 
that might account for the caregiver's behavior. The secure 
infant feels safe in making attributions of mental states to ac­
count for this behavior. In contrast, the avoidant child shuns the 
mental state of the other to some degree, while the resistant 
child focuses on his own state of distress, to the exclusion of 
close intersubjective exchanges. Disorganized infants may repre­
sent a special category; hypervigilant of the caregiver's behavior, 
they use all cues available for prediction and may be acutely 
sensitized to intentional states, and thus they may be more 

350 / Clinical Perspectives 
ready to construct a mentalized account of the caregiver's be­
havior. In such children mentalization may be evident, but it 
does not have the central and effective role in self-organization 
that characterizes securely attached children. There may be a 
number of linked reasons for this: (a) the caregiver of the disor­
ganized infant is less likely to be reliably contingent in respond­
ing to the infant's self-state, and further to show systematic 
biases in her perception and reflection of his state; (b) the mental 
state of the caregiver evokes intense anxiety, either through 
frightening behavior, suggesting malevolence toward the child, 
or behavior suggesting fear, which may include fear of the child 
himself; (c) the child needs to use disproportionate resources to 
understand the parent's behavior, at the expense of reflecting on 
self-states. These factors combine, perhaps, to make disorgan­
ized infants keen readers of the caregiver's mind under certain 
circumstances, but (we suggest) poor readers of their own men­
tal states. 
3. The caregiver makes a further important contribution, per­
haps most important at a somewhat later stage. Prototypically, 
while playing with the child, the caregiver simultaneously en­
gages the child's internal world while retaining an external 
reality-based perspective (Fonagy and Target 1996; Target and 
Fonagy 1996). The child is moved from a subjective world of 
psychic equivalence—where internal experience and external re­
ality are assumed to be equivalent—to a mentalized internal 
world where subjective experiences are recognized as but one 
version of external reality, a "representation of reality." This is 
analogous to psychoanalytic discussions of the cognitive impact 
of the oedipal triad, where the shared reality of two people is 
suddenly experienced from the point of view of the third (Britton 
1998). The parents' engagement in the child's internal world 
moves him beyond the conception of his mind as a replica of the 
external world. 
These three components—the second-order representation of af­
fect and the intentional representation of the caregiver and of 
the self—equip the child to confront a sometimes harsh social 
reality. The robust establishment of reflective function is protec­
ts s Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 351 
tive; fragile reflective function predicts a vulnerability to later 
trauma. Secure attachment and reflective function are overlap­
ping constructs, and the vulnerability associated with insecure 
attachment lies primarily in the child's diffidence in conceiving 
of the world in terms of psychic rather than physical reality. 
Given trauma of sufficient intensity, even a secure bond may 
sometimes crumble, yet in the absence of psychosocial pres­
sures, reflective function may offer only marginal developmental 
advantage. To understand severe personality disorder, it is im­
portant that we are attuned to the limited capacity of the patient 
to use the language of mental states for self-organization as well 
as social understanding. 
A TRANSGENERATIONAL MODEL 
OF PERSONALITY DISORDER 
The social inheritance aspect of BPD may be an important clue in 
our understanding of the disorder. Studies by our group (Fonagy 
et al. 1996) as well as others (Patrick et al. 1994) have demon­
strated considerable distortions of attachment representation in 
personality-disordered, particularly borderline, individuals. In 
our study, individuals with BPD diagnosis had predominantly 
preoccupied attachments, associated with unresolved experi­
ences of trauma and a striking reduction in reflective capacity. In 
a further study we compared our patient group to a matched 
group of forensic psychiatric referrals. In the latter group,

ready to construct a mentalized account of the caregiver's be­
havior. In such children mentalization may be evident, but it 
does not have the central and effective role in self-organization 
that characterizes securely attached children. There may be a 
number of linked reasons for this: (a) the caregiver of the disor­
ganized infant is less likely to be reliably contingent in respond­
ing to the infant's self-state, and further to show systematic 
biases in her perception and reflection of his state; (b) the mental 
state of the caregiver evokes intense anxiety, either through 
frightening behavior, suggesting malevolence toward the child, 
or behavior suggesting fear, which may include fear of the child 
himself; (c) the child needs to use disproportionate resources to 
understand the parent's behavior, at the expense of reflecting on 
self-states. These factors combine, perhaps, to make disorgan­
ized infants keen readers of the caregiver's mind under certain 
circumstances, but (we suggest) poor readers of their own men­
tal states. 
3. The caregiver makes a further important contribution, per­
haps most important at a somewhat later stage. Prototypically, 
while playing with the child, the caregiver simultaneously en­
gages the child's internal world while retaining an external 
reality-based perspective (Fonagy and Target 1996; Target and 
Fonagy 1996). The child is moved from a subjective world of 
psychic equivalence—where internal experience and external re­
ality are assumed to be equivalent—to a mentalized internal 
world where subjective experiences are recognized as but one 
version of external reality, a "representation of reality." This is 
analogous to psychoanalytic discussions of the cognitive impact 
of the oedipal triad, where the shared reality of two people is 
suddenly experienced from the point of view of the third (Britton 
1998). The parents' engagement in the child's internal world 
moves him beyond the conception of his mind as a replica of the 
external world. 
These three components—the second-order representation of af­
fect and the intentional representation of the caregiver and of 
the self—equip the child to confront a sometimes harsh social 
reality. The robust establishment of reflective function is protec­
ts s Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 351 
tive; fragile reflective function predicts a vulnerability to later 
trauma. Secure attachment and reflective function are overlap­
ping constructs, and the vulnerability associated with insecure 
attachment lies primarily in the child's diffidence in conceiving 
of the world in terms of psychic rather than physical reality. 
Given trauma of sufficient intensity, even a secure bond may 
sometimes crumble, yet in the absence of psychosocial pres­
sures, reflective function may offer only marginal developmental 
advantage. To understand severe personality disorder, it is im­
portant that we are attuned to the limited capacity of the patient 
to use the language of mental states for self-organization as well 
as social understanding. 
A TRANSGENERATIONAL MODEL 
OF PERSONALITY DISORDER 
The social inheritance aspect of BPD may be an important clue in 
our understanding of the disorder. Studies by our group (Fonagy 
et al. 1996) as well as others (Patrick et al. 1994) have demon­
strated considerable distortions of attachment representation in 
personality-disordered, particularly borderline, individuals. In 
our study, individuals with BPD diagnosis had predominantly 
preoccupied attachments, associated with unresolved experi­
ences of trauma and a striking reduction in reflective capacity. In 
a further study we compared our patient group to a matched 
group of forensic psychiatric referrals. In the latter group, 
dismissing patterns of attachment predominated, unresolved 
trauma was less evident (although the prevalence of trauma was 
comparable), and reflective capacity was even lower (Levinson 
and Fonagy, unpublished manuscript, UCL). 
We shall argue that the dysfunctional and distorted under­
standing of other minds (and of the mind of the self) characteris­
tic of some personality-disordered individuals is the result of 
adverse traumatic experiences with attachment figures (often 
involving physical maltreatment and/or sexual abuse) during 
the early formation of attachment representations. We recognize, 
however, that explicit maltreatment is not an inevitable part of 

352 / Clinical Perspectives 
BPD pathology. Early neglect may sensitize individuals to later 
attachment trauma, and psychological abuse associated with 
persistent neglect of the young child's sense of subjectivity might 
be harder to recognize than frank maltreatment. The pathologi­
cal consequences of early attachment trauma are mediated by 
the distorting effect that such a deviant attachment context 
exerts on the normal unfolding of mindreading abilities. 
THE IMPACT OF MALTREATMENT 
ON REFLECTIVE FUNCTION 
One serious consequence of parental neglect, maltreatment, and 
abuse is the lack of a sensitive and infant-attuned emotional-
intentional mirroring environment that we hypothesized to be 
necessary for the establishment of secondary representations for 
the infant's self-states. Lacking such secondary representations, 
the affective impulses of the "constitutional self remain rela­
tively inaccessible and nonconscious, resulting in feelings of 
emptiness and disorganization and in a deficient ability for im­
pulse control. There is accumulating evidence that maltreatment 
impairs the child's reflective capacities and sense of self (Beeghly 
and Cicchetti 1994; Schneider-Rosen and Cicchetti 1984, 1991). 
This situation can, and probably often does, induce a severe 
and vicious developmental cycle. Poor comprehension of mental 
states associated with maltreatment amplifies distress, activat­
ing the attachment system. The need for proximity thus persists 
and perhaps even increases as a consequence of the distress 
caused by abuse. Mental proximity becomes unbearably painful, 
and the need for closeness is expressed at a physical level. Thus, 
the child may paradoxically be driven physically closer to the 
abuser. This ability to adapt to, modify, or avoid the perpetra­
tor's behavior is likely to be constrained by limited mentalizing 
skills, and exposure to further abuse is likely. The paradox of 
proximity seeking at the physical level concurrent with psycho­
logical avoidance lies at the root of the disorganized attachment 
so consistently seen in abused children. ; Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 353 
Why should the family environment of maltreatment under­
mine reflective function? (a) Recognition of the mental state of 
the other can be dangerous to the developing self. The child who 
recognizes the hatred or murderousness implied by the parent's 
acts of abuse is forced to see himself as worthless or unlovable, 
(fa) The meaning of intentional states may be denied or distorted; 
abusive parents commonly claim beliefs or feelings at odds with 
their behavior, (c) The attachment context and the public world, 
where reflective function is common, are kept rigidly separate, 
(d) Last, the dysfunction may occur, not because of the maltreat­
ment itself, but because of the family atmosphere that surrounds 
it. Authoritarian parenting, commonly associated with maltreat­
ment, is also known to retard the development of mentalization 
(Astington 1996). These youngsters and their mothers find it 
difficult to take a playful stance (Alessandri 1992), so the social 
scaffolding needed for the development of mentalization may be 
absent. A mentalizing stance is also unlikely to develop in a child 
who generally feels treated as an uncared-for physical object. 
Stating this more generally, we would argue that exploring 
the infant-directed intentions and emotional attitudes inferable 
from the abuser's actions can result in seriously dysfunctional 
consequences for the developing self. On the one hand, the 
persecutory intentions attributed to the abusive attachment fig­
ure represent continuous danger to the self and an acute lack of 
feelings of attachment security. On the other hand, the child, in 
an attempt to rationalize the persecutory intentions of the care­
giver, often ends up attributing seriously negative properties of 
worthlessness, unwantedness, ugliness, and so forth to his own 
self-image. We have proposed (Fonagy 1991) that the character­
istic defensive reaction of coping with these consequences by the 
general inhibition of the tendency to mentalize about the abusive 
caregiver's intentions is most likely to occur if the capacity to 
mentalize was poorly established in early infancy. The child is 
more likely to develop a tendency to avoid contemplating the 
mental states of the abuser if thinking has remained somewhat 
teleological and the internal world is more likely to be repre­
sented in the mode of psychic equivalence (see chapters 5 and 6).

sentations vis-a-vis the maltreating caregiver results in a deficit 
in mentalization capacities, at least, in object relations that are 
related or similar to the abusive attachment context. We see this 
as the result of a reversible inhibition of a natural biological 
tendency to try to read the mind states of the attachment figure; 
the child's tendency to stop monitoring and learning about the 
relevant cues that support mental-state attributions, however, 
leads gradually to an increasingly impoverished understanding 
of other minds. This, then, creates a deficit-like state that is a 
great deal more difficult to reverse, even given more favorable 
social circumstances. 
PERSONALITY DISORDER 
AND DEFICIT IN MENTALIZING 
Are some characteristics of personality disorder rooted in a 
deficit of mentalization? It may be tempting to argue that some 
problems of violence andf borderline states can be explained as 
dismissive and preoccupied forms of nonmentalizing self-organi­
zations, respectively. This would be oversimplistic. In both 
instances there are variations across situations or types of rela­
tionships. The delinquent adolescent is, for example, aware of 
the mental states of others in his gang and the borderline 
individual is at times hypersensitive to the emotional states of 
mental-health professionals and family members. 
Following the principles of Kurt Fischer's "dynamic skills 
theory" of development (Fischer et al. 1990), we assume that 
maltreatment is associated with a "fractionation" or splitting of 
reflective function across tasks and domains. During the earlier 
stages of Piagetian development, just as the understanding of 
conservation of liquid does not as yet generalize to conservation 
of area, reflective capacity in one domain of interpersonal inter­
action may not at first generalize to others. In normal develop­
ment, there would be some degree of integration and generaliza­
tion of a mentalizing model of behavior. In severe personality 
disorder, however, development goes awry—the normal coordi­
nation of previously separate skills does not come about. Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 355 
Teleological models of behavior persist in all of us and develop 
in sophistication, as in many circumstances they provide useful 
predictions and adequate explanations. For example, if on a wet 
day one observes one's friend crossing the road, one might, 
taking the intentional stance, infer that he does not wish to get 
wet (desire state) and he thinks there is still a shop on that side 
that sells umbrellas (belief state). (It actually closed two weeks 
ago—I snigger with appropriate Schadenfreude.) However, the 
same action could also be interpreted as rational within the 
teleological framework. One could conclude that one's friend has 
crossed the road in order to be able to walk faster (visible 
outcome) because there are too many people on this side (vis­
ible constraint). Clearly, the application of the teleological stance 
can become problematic in the context of attachment relation­
ships. Assume that X is a close friend. Adopting the teleological 
stance may be helpful in avoiding imputing the desire to X that 
he wanted to avoid me and the belief state that he thinks I did not 
see him or that he thinks that I think that he did not see me. 
The mentalizing inferences of the intentional stance are no 
more likely to be correct than the physicalistic ones of the 
teleological mode. However, mentalizing models are uniquely 
valuable in complex interpersonal situations, involving for in­
stance conflict, deception, or irrationality. Unfortunately, non-
reflective internal working models come to dominate the behavior 
of personality-disordered individuals in emotionally charged or 
intimate relationships, and any interpersonal situation that calls 
forth relationship representations that derive from the primary 
attachment relationships. These individuals can be disadvan­
taged because (a) their caregivers did not facilitate mentalizing 
capacity within a secure attachment relationship (vulnerability), 
(b) they have subsequently acquired an emotional disincentive 
for taking the perspective of others who are hostile as well as 
nonreflective (trauma), (c) subsequent relationships are jeopard­
ized by the lack of a mental-state attributional model of the 
original trauma and subsequent experiences (lack of resilience), 
and (d) they may divide mentalizing resources unevenly between 
their external and internal worlds, becoming hypervigilant to­
ward others but uncomprehending of their own states (uneven 
adaptation).

DISORGANIZED ATTACHMENT 
AND PERSONALITY DISORDER 
Why should emotionally charged interactions trigger a "regres­
sion" to nonmentalistic thinking? We have suggested that reflec­
tive function and its attachment context are at the root of self-
organization. There is overwhelming pressure on the child to 
develop a representation for internal states. As we saw in chapter 
4, within the biopsychosocial attachment system the child seeks 
out aspects of the environment that are contingently related to 
his self-expressions. The child's emerging self-representation will 
map onto what could,be called a primary or "constitutional self* 
(the child's actual internal states). In the case of disorganized 
attachment, however, the self-representation will not be true to 
this. Winnicott (1967, p. 33) warned us that a child who fails 
to find his current state mirrored is likely to internalize the 
mother's actual state as part of his own self-structure. Evidence 
is accumulating that caregivers of disorganized infants frequent­
ly respond to the infant's distress by hostile-helpless (Lyons-
Ruth, Bronfman, and Parsons 1999), dissociated or disorgan­
ized, frightened or frightening (Jacobovitz, Hazen, and Riggs 
1997; Schuengel 1997; Schuengel, Bakermans-Kranenburg, and 
van Uzendoorn 1999) behavior. It is as if the infant's emotional 
expression triggers a temporary failure on the part of the care­
taker to perceive the child as an intentional person, and she 
responds with massive withdrawal, communication errors, role 
confusion, or negative-intrusive or frightening behavior. Conse­
quently, these children come to experience their own arousal as 
a danger signal for abandonment, which triggers teleological, 
nonmentalizing functioning; it brings forth an image of the par­
ent who withdraws from the child in a state of anxiety or rage, to 
which the child reacts with a complementary dissociative re­
sponse (Liotti 1999). Thus the internal experience of such indi­
viduals remains unlabelled and chaotic, and the uncontained 
affect generates further dysregulation. Rather than internalizing 
a coherent self-representation from the caregiver, the child in­
corporates a representation of the other into his nascent self-
structure (Fonagy and Target 1995a). When confronted with a 
frightened" or frightening caregiver, the infant takes in as part of 
# Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 357 
himself the mother's feeling of rage, hatred, or fear and her image 
of him as frightening or unmanageable. 
As this image undermines self-organization, often it needs to 
be externalized for the child to achieve a coherent self-represen­
tation. The disorganized attachment behavior of the infant (Main 
and Solomon 1990) and its sequelae, bossy and controlling in­
teractions with the parent, may be understood as a rudimentary 
attempt to blot out the unacceptable aspects of the self-repre­
sentation. Research shows that the disoriented disorganized 
behavior of the infant is gradually replaced, over the first 5-7 
years of life, by brittle behavioral strategies that seek to control 
the parent, through either punitive acts or age-inappropriate 
care-giving behavior (Cassidy and Marvin 1992; Main and 
Cassidy 1988). Such attempts at manipulating the behavior of 
the caregiver (George and Solomon 1998; Solomon, George, 
and Dejong 1995; Wartner, Grossmann, Fremmer-Bombrik, and 
Suess 1994) permit the externalization of parts of the self and 
limit further intrusion into the self-representation. Similar pat­
terns are reported in observations of peer interactions (Jacobo­
vitz and Hazen 1999). There is further evidence that the parents 
of such children experience the child as taking control of the 
relationship and, consequently, experience themselves as in­
creasingly immobilized and helpless and failing to provide care-
giving (George and Solomon 1996; Solomon and George 1996). 
The descriptions by mothers of disorganized children are often 
quite remarkable; they see the child as a replica of themselves 
and experience themselves as merging with the child. We assume 
that these experiences are explained by the child externalizing 
aspects of his self-representation that relate, not to the internali­
zation of the mother's representation of the self, but to the 
representation of the mother within the self. The tendency for 
such children to show precocious care-giving behavior (West and 
George, in press) is also consistent with the idea that the repre­
sentation of the mother is internalized into the self. 
In line with Lyons-Ruth's diathesis model (Lyons-Ruth, 
Bronfman, and Atwood 1999; Lyons-Ruth and Jacobovitz 1999), 
we conceive of the flawed self-organization that follows disorgan­
ized attachment as a vulnerability. In particular, the poorly 
constructed self-structure of such children sensitizes them to

constructed self-structure of such children sensitizes them to

later trauma. We believe that there is a biological drive to 
construct a secondary representation of the constitutional self 
through internalizing the infant-directed reactions of attach­
ment figures. This was discussed in some detail in chapter 4. We 
argued that when a contingent affect-mirroring environment is 
provided, the internalized self-representations will map onto the 
primary, procedural self-states of the constitutional self. The 
biologically driven internalization of the self-directed attitudes of 
the attachment figure into the self-structure takes place, how­
ever, even when the caregiver is nonreflective, neglectful, or 
abusive. In such cases, the internalized other will remain alien 
and unconnected to the structures of the constitutional self. 
Furthermore, in seriously abusive and maltreating environments 
the internalized alien part of the self will be persecutory and will 
represent a continuous danger of self-harm and consequent lack 
of feelings of attachment security. The absence of adequate 
second-order (symbolic) representations of self-states creates a 
continuous and intense desire for understanding what is experi­
enced as internal chaos. The child's self-development is delayed, 
and he remains on the look-out for an object that, once internal­
ized, would be capable of bringing about an integration of self-
states. Disastrously, in the case of some children maltreated 
later in development, this will not be a neutral other but, rather, 
a torturing one. Once internalized and lodged within the self-
representation, this hostile "alien" representation will have to be 
expelled not only because it does not match the constitutional 
self, but also because it is persecutory. The consequences for 
interpersonal relationships and for affect regulation are then 
disastrous (Carlson and Sroufe 1995). The fact that the internal­
ized alien is not grounded in or bound to the actual self-states of 
the constitutional self, together with the further fact that it 
represents a persecutory threat to the self, motivates a strong 
defensive tendency to externalize the alien part of the self by 
projecting it onto others. As long as the internalized torturing 
alien is projected onto the other, the self achieves a temporary 
(and illusory) sense of control and feeling of security. The price to 
pay for this fleeting sense of self-organization and control is 
great, however. Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 359 
The mechanism described here may be a prototypical example 
of the psychoanalytic notion of projective identification or, more 
specifically, what Elizabeth Spillius (1994) has termed "evoca-
tory projective identification." Simply put, disorganized attach­
ment gives rise to a disorganized self. The individual, when 
alone, feels unsafe and vulnerable because of the proximity of a 
torturing and destructive representation from which he cannot 
escape because it is experienced from within the self. Unless his 
relationships permit externalization, he feels almost literally at 
risk of disappearance, psychological merging, and the dissolu­
tion of all relationship boundaries (Gunderson 1984). 
SYMPTOMATOLOGY 
OF BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER 
Several lines of evidence suggest that borderline patients are 
seriously deficient in social (or mental) reality testing. In particu­
lar, their ability to monitor and interpret correctly the relevant 
mind-state cues available in intimate attachment relationships 
seems inhibited, undeveloped, or distorted. When attributing 
mental states, they often disregard or bypass such cues, and, 
instead, they identify the mind states of others in a distorted way 
through defensive splitting and projective identification. Nor do 
they do much better when it comes to understanding their own 
mind states: they often report feelings of emptiness or chaotic 
and undifferentiated self-states. Their emotional instability, 
their proneness for acting out and for externalizing violent im­
pulses, all indicate a rather low degree of awareness of self-
states and a consequent lack of self-control. 
Let us briefly review some common symptomatology of bor­
derline states from the point of view of the model we have 
outlined.

derline states from the point of view of the model we have 
outlined. 
1. The unstable sense of self of many such patients is a conse­
quence of the absence of reflective capacity and of accurate 
second-order representations of internal states (feelings, beliefs, 
wishes, ideas). A stable sense of self is illusorily achieved when 

360 / Clinical Perspectives 
the alien self is externalized onto the other and controlled there­
in. The individual, then, is an active agent who is in control, 
despite the fragility of the self. The heavy price paid is that by 
forcing the other to behave as if he or she were part of his 
internal representation, the potential for a "real" relationship 
has been lost, and the patient is actually preparing the way for 
abandonment. The projective and persecutory construction of 
the other's mind in intimate relationships represents a coercive, 
aggressive, and distorting communicative attitude that is usu­
ally greatly resented by the partner. As a result, there is a 
serious realistic risk of abandonment in such relationships. The 
eventual abandonment also means a return of the projected 
hostile and torturing alien into the self, together with the conse­
quent feelings of danger, terror, and disorganization. 
2. The impulsivity of such patients may also be due to a lack 
of awareness of their own emotional states associated with the 
absence of symbolic representations of emotions. Borderline pa­
tients often find themselves in states of emotional arousal that 
are beyond self-control, since mentalization is an essential com­
ponent of affect regulation. Other affects are often brought forth 
to protect the self, and apparently uncontrollable rage may 
express, as well as obscure, the experience of fragmentation. 
Impulsivity may also be due to the dominance of prementalistic 
physical action-centered strategies, particularly in threatening 
relationships. It is only when behavior is construed as inten­
tional that one can conceive of influencing it through changing 
the other's state of mind. Talking about it only makes sense if 
the behavior of the other has been explained in terms of wishes 
and beliefs. If, on the other hand, it is interpreted solely in terms 
of its observable consequence, a kind of "learned mentalistic 
helplessness" sets in. The obvious way then to intervene will be 
through physical action. This may include words that sound like 
an attempt at changing the other person's intentions but are, in 
fact, intimidation—efforts to force the other person into a differ­
ent course of action. Only a physical end-state is seen. This may 
be represented in terms of that person's body. The patient may 
physically threaten, hit, damage, or even kill; alternatively, he 
may tease, excite, even seduce. Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 361 
Such patients bring many memories of having been treated in 
such ways. A young man confessed to his father that he had 
accidentally broken a lamp. The father reassured him that it was 
OK since he didn't do it on purpose. The father later saw that the 
lamp the child had broken was his favorite, and he beat his son 
so hard that he fractured his arm as the child raised it to protect 
himself. The father's mind is working in a nonmentalizing (tele­
ological) mode in these examples. It is what the child has done 
(visible outcome), rather than his intention (mental state), that 
drives the father's action. 
In this context the distinction between the two apparently 
overlapping modes of representing intentional action is particu­
larly helpful. It will be remembered that following Jeannerod 
(1994) an "intention-in-action" was defined as a representation 
with a content that specifies the particular bodily action in 
relation to its goal state and is the proximal cause of the motor 
behavior. It is a representational state that does not simply 
trigger the action but also functions to monitor and guide it, 
allowing for an on-line comparison between perceptual feedback 
about the outcome state achieved and the goal state as specified 
in the representation. Their content can become the subject of 
consciousness especially if their execution is blocked, which 
might make them appear as if they were mentalized representa­
tions, but in essence they are nonconscious actions carried out 
automatically. In contrast, "prior intentions" are representations 
that are present prior to the motor action (and the concomitant 
intention-in-action). They can be active and consciously experi­
enced even when the intended action does not get executed. 
Prior intentions contain a representation of the self in relation to 
the desired goal state (future reality) and can generate particular 
intention-in-actions when conditions in the external world allow 
the self to execute a viable action to fulfill the goal. Prior inten­
tions need not represent the specific goal state aimed at but just 
the general motivational state prior to the action. Impulsivity in 
BPD may be thus seen as representations of intentional actions 
generated by the "teleological stance" corresponding to the level 
of representations of intention-in-actions. The principle of ra­
tional action still guides impulsive acts but as a function of 
available evidence about the "pragmatic" aspects of a goal object.

about the specific situational constraints on action, and about 
the dispositional constraints characteristic of the actor. Thus, 
for example, prior intention is not attributed to the other, and 
the consequences of the action are not predicted, commonly 
leading to sizable interpersonal conflicts and other social dis­
asters. 
3. Emotional instability and irritability require us to think about 
the representation of reality in borderline patients. Interpersonal 
schemata are notably rigid in borderline patients because they 
cannot imagine that the other could have a construction of 
reality that is different from the one they experience as compel­
ling. If the behavior of the other and knowledge of reality do not 
fit, we normally try to understand the behavior in mentalizing 
terms. For example, "He mistook my $20 for a $10 bill (false 
belief)—that is why he only gave me $5 change." If this and other 
possibilities do not readily occur to one, and alternatives cannot 
easily be compared, an oversimplified construction is uncritically 
accepted: "He was cheating me!" Especially for individuals who 
had nonreflective, coercive caregivihg, this frequently leads to 
paranoid constructions of the other's desire state.1 Mentalization 
acts as a buffer: when actions of others are unexpected, this 
buffer function allows one to create auxiliary hypotheses about 
beliefs, which forestall automatic threatening conclusions. 
Once again, we see the traumatized individual doubly disad­
vantaged. Internal working models constructed on the basis of 
abuse assume that malevolence is not improbable; being un­
able to generate auxiliary hypotheses, particularly under stress, 
makes the experience of danger even more compelling. Psychic 
equivalence makes it real. Normally, access to the mentalization 
buffer allows one to play with reality (Target and Fonagy 1996). 
Understanding is known to be fallible. But if there is only one 
way of seeing things, an attempt by a third party, such as a 
therapist, to persuade the patient that he is wrong might be 
perceived as an attempt to drive him crazy. 
1 The striking facet of such constructions is that they tend to be self-related. 
The individual with a self-representation constructed around an abusive 
caregiver is constantly on the alert to externalize this persecutory self-represen­
tation. He needs enemies to prevent the destructiveness within. Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 363 
4. A brief word about suicidality. Clinicians are familiar with 
the enormous fear of physical abandonment in borderline pa­
tients (Gunderson 1996). This, perhaps more than any other 
aspect, alerts clinicians to the disorganized attachment models 
with which such patients are forced to live. When the other is 
needed for self-coherence, abandonment means reinternalizing 
the intolerable, alien self-image and consequent destruction of 
the self. Suicide represents the fantasized destruction of this 
alien other within the self. Suicide attempts are often aimed at 
forestalling the possibility of abandonment; they seem a last-
ditch attempt at reestablishing a relationship. The child's experi­
ence may have been that only something extreme would bring 
about changes in the adult's behavior, and that their caregivers 
used similarly coercive measures to influence their own be­
havior. The strong tendency for suicide so often triggered by 
abandonment in borderline patients can also be understood to 
represent a fantasized destruction of the internalized hostile 
alien, a final attempt to liberate the constitutional self from its 
torturer. 
Whereas suicide and self-harm are common manifestations of 
disorganized attachment in women, in men with similar pathol­
ogy it is violence against the other that is more common. Such a 
person can only maintain a relationship if this enables him to 
externalize alien parts of the self. The relationship that violent 
men are forced to establish is one where their significant other 
can act as a vehicle for intolerable self-states. They control their 
relationship through crude manipulation .in order to engender 
the self-image that they feel desperate to disown. They resort to 
violence at times when the independent mental existence of the 
other threatens this process of externalization. At these times, 
dramatic and radical action is taken because the individual is 
terrorized by the possibility that the coherence of self achieved 
through control and manipulation will be destroyed by the 
return of what has been externalized. The act of violence at 
such moments performs a dual function: (a) to recreate and 
reexperience the alien self within the other, and (b) to destroy it 
in the unconscious hope that it will then be destroyed forever. 
Perceiving the terror in the eyes of their victim, they are once 
again reassured, and the relationship regains its paramount

that their need for a relationship where this externalization is 
possible is undoubtedly absolute. 
5. Splitting, the partial representation of the other (or the self) 
is a common obstacle to adequate communication with such 
patients. Understanding the other in mental terms initially re­
quires integrating assumed intentions in a coherent manner. 
The hopelessness of this task in the face of the contradictory 
attitudes of an abuser is seen as one of the causes of the 
mentalizing deficit. The emergent solution for the child, given the 
imperative to arrive at coherent representations, is to split the 
representation of the other into several coherent subsets of 
intentions (Gergely 1997, 2000)—primarily, into an idealized and 
a persecutory identity. In the absence of reflective function, the 
individual finds it impossible to use both representations simul­
taneously. Splitting enables the individual to create mentalized 
images of others, but these are inaccurate and oversimplified 
and allow for only an illusion of mentalized interpersonal inter­
change. 
As splitting is generally agreed to be the prototypical defense 
of borderline personality disorder, it seems appropriate to ex­
pand on this idea further. In naive theory of mind, predicting 
another person's actions from his beliefs and desires is driven by 
a basic principle of "rational action" (Gergely et al. 1995). This 
principle assumes that human agents tend to pursue a course of 
action to fulfill their desires that seems most rational or efficient, 
given their beliefs about.the situation. This is supplemented by a 
further assumption that we can call the principle of "mental 
coherence" (Dennett 1987; Gergely 2000). This additional princi­
ple assumes that the intentions, beliefs, and desires of rational 
human beings are not contradictory or ambivalent. Clearly, if 
this assumption is seriously violated, it becomes impossible to 
identify and predict a rational course of action that would satisfy 
the simultaneously present contradictory intentions of the other. 
In such a case, the other's behavior becomes unpredictable by 
the child through mentalization, and feelings of anxiety, help­
lessness, and insecurity are generated. Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 365 
Gergely (2000) proposed that the maltreatment attachment 
context represents precisely such a dilemma for young children. 
By about 2 years of age infants become able to derive generalized 
intentions and attitudes that characterize the mind of the at­
tachment figure. The caregiver who generates attachment disor­
ganization (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobovitz 1999; Schuengel et al. 
1999), however, typically provides contradictory information re­
garding her infant-directed mental attitudes: sometimes she 
abuses the child, while at other times she seems to deny this 
and even behaves in a caring fashion. By inferring the corre­
sponding persecutory and benevolent intentions and attributing 
them to the caregiver's mind, the child faces the impossible task 
of anticipating the other's behavior from contradictory or am­
bivalent intentions. As a defense against the ensuing uncer­
tainty, anxiety, and helplessness, the child splits the identity of 
the abuser into separate minds with noncontradictory (persecu­
tory versus benevolent) sets of intentions. As a result, predict­
ing action through mentalization becomes possible again, since 
within the separate and split identities of the other the principle 
of mental coherence can be maintained. In this way the feelings 
of helplessness and anxiety triggered by the inability to predict 
the other's behavior through mentalization are avoided. The 
great price to be paid for this defensive construction of social 
experience is, of course, the ensuing distortion of reality and the 
generation of mistaken and maladaptive responses when actions 
are anticipated incorrectly based on the split representations of 
the other's mind. 
6. The second prototypical borderline defense is held to be 
projective identification (Ogden 1979; Spillius 1992). We have 
argued that in the normal development of mindreading there are 
two mechanisms by which attribution of mental states to the 
other is accomplished: (a) by monitoring the relevant behavioral 
and situational cues to infer the mind states of the other, or, if 
such cues are not available or not recognized, one can (b) resort 
to "default simulation": attributing mental states to the other 
through analogy to the self. Above we argued that in an abusive 
attachment context the child often develops a defensive inhibi­
tion to mentalizing about the caregiver's intentions. This may, in

patients. Understanding the other in mental terms initially re­
quires integrating assumed intentions in a coherent manner. 
The hopelessness of this task in the face of the contradictory 
attitudes of an abuser is seen as one of the causes of the 
mentalizing deficit. The emergent solution for the child, given the 
imperative to arrive at coherent representations, is to split the 
representation of the other into several coherent subsets of 
intentions (Gergely 1997, 2000)—primarily, into an idealized and 
a persecutory identity. In the absence of reflective function, the 
individual finds it impossible to use both representations simul­
taneously. Splitting enables the individual to create mentalized 
images of others, but these are inaccurate and oversimplified 
and allow for only an illusion of mentalized interpersonal inter­
change. 
As splitting is generally agreed to be the prototypical defense 
of borderline personality disorder, it seems appropriate to ex­
pand on this idea further. In naive theory of mind, predicting 
another person's actions from his beliefs and desires is driven by 
a basic principle of "rational action" (Gergely et al. 1995). This 
principle assumes that human agents tend to pursue a course of 
action to fulfill their desires that seems most rational or efficient, 
given their beliefs about.the situation. This is supplemented by a 
further assumption that we can call the principle of "mental 
coherence" (Dennett 1987; Gergely 2000). This additional princi­
ple assumes that the intentions, beliefs, and desires of rational 
human beings are not contradictory or ambivalent. Clearly, if 
this assumption is seriously violated, it becomes impossible to 
identify and predict a rational course of action that would satisfy 
the simultaneously present contradictory intentions of the other. 
In such a case, the other's behavior becomes unpredictable by 
the child through mentalization, and feelings of anxiety, help­
lessness, and insecurity are generated. Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 365 
Gergely (2000) proposed that the maltreatment attachment 
context represents precisely such a dilemma for young children. 
By about 2 years of age infants become able to derive generalized 
intentions and attitudes that characterize the mind of the at­
tachment figure. The caregiver who generates attachment disor­
ganization (Lyons-Ruth and Jacobovitz 1999; Schuengel et al. 
1999), however, typically provides contradictory information re­
garding her infant-directed mental attitudes: sometimes she 
abuses the child, while at other times she seems to deny this 
and even behaves in a caring fashion. By inferring the corre­
sponding persecutory and benevolent intentions and attributing 
them to the caregiver's mind, the child faces the impossible task 
of anticipating the other's behavior from contradictory or am­
bivalent intentions. As a defense against the ensuing uncer­
tainty, anxiety, and helplessness, the child splits the identity of 
the abuser into separate minds with noncontradictory (persecu­
tory versus benevolent) sets of intentions. As a result, predict­
ing action through mentalization becomes possible again, since 
within the separate and split identities of the other the principle 
of mental coherence can be maintained. In this way the feelings 
of helplessness and anxiety triggered by the inability to predict 
the other's behavior through mentalization are avoided. The 
great price to be paid for this defensive construction of social 
experience is, of course, the ensuing distortion of reality and the 
generation of mistaken and maladaptive responses when actions 
are anticipated incorrectly based on the split representations of 
the other's mind. 
6. The second prototypical borderline defense is held to be 
projective identification (Ogden 1979; Spillius 1992). We have 
argued that in the normal development of mindreading there are 
two mechanisms by which attribution of mental states to the 
other is accomplished: (a) by monitoring the relevant behavioral 
and situational cues to infer the mind states of the other, or, if 
such cues are not available or not recognized, one can (b) resort 
to "default simulation": attributing mental states to the other 
through analogy to the self. Above we argued that in an abusive 
attachment context the child often develops a defensive inhibi­
tion to mentalizing about the caregiver's intentions. This may, in 

366 / Clinical Perspectives 
turn, result in a general deficiency of attention processes in 
monitoring for and reading the relevant behavioral and situ­
ational cues that would allow the child to infer the other's 
mental states. As a result, the child will automatically resort to 
interpreting the other's mind through "default simulation" even 
when the relevant informative cues are, in principle, available. 
Now the question is: what contents of his own mind will the child 
use to "default simulate" the other's mental experience? We have 
seen that as a result of abusive caregiving, the young child 
internalizes the representation of the hostile and alien other into 
his self-structure. We have also argued that due to the danger 
that its persecutory aspects represent to the self, and due to its 
lack of groundedness in the actual self-states of the constitu­
tional self, a defensive tendency to expel this internalized alien 
through projection onto others will be established. Now if the 
other's mental states cannot be identified through cue-reading 
as a result of the defensive inhibition of mentalizing about the 
abuser's mind, when resorting to "default simulation," the to-be-
expelled alien part of the self-representation will be readily avail­
able to provide the informational basis for simulating the other. 
Thus, borderline patients will show a tendency to "default simu­
late" the other's mental state automatically by projecting onto 
him the internalized persecutory representation of the abusive 
caregiver. This is why the defense mechanism of "projective 
identification" becomes so prominent in the manner in which 
borderline patients construct distorted representations of the 
mental states of others in intimate relationships and in the 
analytic transference. 
7. A further common experience of such patients is the feeling 
of emptiness that accompanies much of their lives. The empti­
ness is a direct consequence of the absence of secondary repre­
sentations of self-states, certainly at the conscious level, and of 
the shallowness with which other people and relationships are 
experienced. The abandonment of mentalization creates a deep 
sense of isolation. To experience being with another, the person 
has to be there as a mind; to feel the continuity between past 
and present, it is mental states that provide the link; emptiness 
and, at an extreme, dissociation is the best description such Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 367 
individuals can give of the absence of meaning that the. failure of 
mentalization creates. 
SOME QUALIFICATIONS 
OF THE MODEL PROPOSED 
A number of qualifications are in order. 
1. Abnormalities of parenting represent but one route to diffi­
culties with mentalization. Biological vulnerabilities, such as 
attention deficits, are also likely to limit the child's opportunities 
for evolving reflective capacity. We should be aware that, as in 
most aspects of development, there is a subtle bidirectional 
causal process inherent in such biological vulnerabilities. Vul­
nerabilities provoke situations of interpersonal conflict as well as 
placing limitations on the child's capacities. Thus biological fac­
tors can limit mentalizing potential but may also act through 
generating environments where mentalization is unlikely to be 
fully established. 
2. Many of us working with borderline patients willingly attest 
to their at times apparently acute sensitivity to mind states, 
certainly for the purposes of manipulation and control. Does this 
imply that mentalization is not a core dysfunction? The likely 
solution to this puzzle is that patients with severe personality 
disorders do develop a certain level of nonconscious mindreading 
skills. Clements and Perner (1994) show that children just before 
the age of 3 years have an intuitive understanding of false belief, 
which they are unable to communicate verbally but can demon­
strate in their nonverbal reactions, such as eye movements. It is 
conceivable that, at a stage when such nonconscious mind-
reading skills begin to evolve, the implications of the child trying 
to infer the intentions behind their caregivers' reactions are so 
negative that they are forced' to fall back on the strategy of 
influencing the other by action rather than by words. However, 
they retain access, at a nonconscious level, to mental states 
but repudiate consciousness of it. Reflective function does not

monitoring for and reading the relevant behavioral and situ­
ational cues that would allow the child to infer the other's 
mental states. As a result, the child will automatically resort to

permanently disappear: borderline patients are not "mind blind": 
rather, they are not "mind conscious." They pick up on cues 
that influence the behavioral system, but this does not surface 
in terms of conscious inferences. The developmental deficit is: 
[a] restricted to specific internal working models (or relationship 
patterns); (b) likely to be activated in specific attachment con­
texts; and (c) may pertain more to reflective self-function (reflec­
tion on self-states) than to envisioning the mental world of the 
other. 
3. Not all parents of individuals with problems related to 
mentalization are borderline. Some parents, in our experience 
at least, are highly reflective Individuals, who have, however, 
significant problems related to their children and sometimes to 
a specific child. Lack of sensitivity to intentional states is not a 
global variable affecting all situations. It must be assessed in 
relation to a specific child-caregiver relationship. 
PSYCHOTHERAPY AND MENTALIZING 
Psychotherapy, in all its incarnations, is about the rekindling of 
mentalization. Whether we look at Marcia Linehan's dialectic 
behavior therapy protocol (Linehan 1993), John Clarkin's and 
Otto Kernberg's recommendations for psychoanalytic psycho­
therapy (Clarkin, Kernberg, and Yeomans 1999; Kernberg and 
Clarkin 1993), or Anthony Ryle's cognitive analytic therapy (Ryle 
1997), they all: (a) aim to establish an attachment relationship 
with the patient, (b) aim to use this to create an interpersonal 
context where understanding of mental states becomes a focus, 
and (c) attempt (mostly implicitly) to recreate a situation where 
the self is recognized as intentional and real by the therapist, 
and this recognition is clearly perceived by the patient. 
The core of psychological therapy with individuals with severe 
personality disorder is the enhancement of reflective processes. 
The therapist must help the patient to understand and label 
emotional states with a view to strengthening the secondary 
representational system. Often this is achieved not just by inter­im 
Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 369 
pretations of moment-to-moment changes in the patient's emo­
tional stance but by focusing the patient's attention on the 
therapist's experience. The patient comes in looking somewhat 
timid. The therapist says: "You see me as frightening." The 
therapist avoids describing complex mental states and rarely 
refers to the patient's conflicts or to his ambivalence (conscious 
or unconscious). Change is generated in these patients by brief, 
specific interpretation. The inevitable destructiveness of these 
patients in relation to the therapeutic enterprise is rarely ade­
quately dealt with by confrontation or interpretations of their 
aggressive intent. Rather, comments are often more helpfully 
aimed at the emotional antecedents of enactments—the emo­
tions that cause confusion and disorganization. 
As we have seen, gaps in mentalization engender impulsivity, 
and the intensification of the therapeutic relationship frequently 
highlights the patient's difficulties in creating a distance be­
tween internal and external reality. The therapist's task is in 
some way analogous to that of the parents who create a frame 
for pretend play—except in this case it is thoughts and feelings 
that need to become accessible through the creation of such a 
transitional area. The therapist must get used to working with 
precursors of mentalization. The task is the elaboration of tele­
ological models into intentional ones. Integrating or trying to 
bridge the dissociated mode of the patient's functioning where 
nothing feels real (certainly not words or ideas) with moments 
when words and ideas carry unbelievable potency and destruc­
tiveness can seem an awesome task. Yet progress is only con­
ceivable by being able to become part of the patient's pretend 
world, trying to make it real while at the same time avoiding 
entanglement with the equation of thoughts and reality. 
Should the psychoanalytic therapist work in the transference 
with borderline patients? The answer is No and Yes. No—in the 
sense that the transference of early relationship patterns onto 
current relationships, while ever-present, is rarely helpful to 
highlight. Without mentalization, transference is not displace­
ment but is experienced as real. The therapist is the abuser—no 
as-if about it. When such transference interpretations are made, 
the patient is often thrown into a pretend mode, and gradually 
patient and therapist may elaborate a world that, however

detailed and complex, has little experiential contact with reality. 
Thus a more productive line is the simple acknowledgment of 
affect in the here-and-now while conveying, in words, tone, and 
posture, that the therapist is able to cope with the patient's 
emotional state. Yes—in that the transference, using the term in 
its broadest sense, is helpful as a concrete demonstration of 
alternative perspectives. The contrast between the patient's per­
ception of the therapist as she or he is imagined and as she or he 
is may help to place quotation marks around the transference 
experience. 
The most complicated challenge arising out of treating such 
patients relates to externalizations of unbearable self-states. 
Some therapists split the transference by creating alternative 
foci for the patient's feelings—a pharmacotherapist and a psy­
chotherapist, individual and group treatments. Others attempt 
to control enactments by making therapy contractually depend­
ent. Sometimes neither of these is possible, at other times 
neither is sufficient. Often, having modest aims is the most 
helpful device. With patients like these, insight will not prevent 
enactment: the therapeutic aim is simply the gradual encourage­
ment of mentalization. Rather than interpreting enactments, the 
therapist tries to deal with their antecedents and consequences. 
She needs to be equally permissive about her own tendency to 
enact in the countertransference. Within this model, it is neces­
sary to accept that in order for the patient to stay in mental 
proximity, the therapist must occasionally allow herself to be­
come the vehicle for the alien part within his self. If she is to be 
of any use to him, she has to become what he needs her to be. 
Yet if she becomes that person fully, she can be of no help to 
him. She aims for a state of equipoise between these two posi­
tions—allowing herself to do as required yet trying to retain in 
her mind as clear and coherent an image of the state of his mind 
as she is able to achieve. 
What are the hallmarks of a successful therapy with an 
individual with severe borderline features? While we do not 
believe that any theory, including the present one, gets any­
where close to explaining the patient's problems, we do believe 
that it is important to have a theoretically coherent approach. 
Such patients require that we are predictable, and our models of Borderline Personality Disorder and Disorganized Attachment / 371 
them can then come to form the core of their self-representa­
tions. A stable, coherent image is hard to maintain should the 
therapist swap theoretical approaches at an alarming rate. Men­
talization can only be acquired in the context of an attachment 
relationship. And this means that the therapy must embody a 
secure base. Attachment is inseparable from a focus on the 
mental state of the other. There can be no bond without under­
standing, even if understanding is possible without a bond. In 
our experience these treatments always take considerable time, 
and consistency over such prolonged periods is often hard to 
maintain. The patient is terrified of and actively fights mental 
closeness, even when physical proximity appears to be his over­
arching goal. Retaining such proximity while under persistent 
attack is neither comfortable nor likely to be achieved unless one 
leaves one's narcissism at the door. 
If the therapist is able to maintain a mental proximity to the 
patient without allowing herself to be overwhelmed by the alien 
other, then her mentalistic, elaborative stance can ultimately 
enable the patient to find himself in the therapist's mind as a 
thinking, feeling being and to integrate this image as part of his 
sense of himself. There is a gradual transformation of a non-
reflective mode of experiencing the internal world that forces the 
equation of the internal and external to one where the internal 
world is treated with more circumspection and respect, separate 
and qualitatively different from physical reality. Even if work 
were to stop here, much would have been achieved in terms of 
making behavior understandable, meaningful, and predictable. 
The internalization of the therapist's concern with mental states 
enhances the patient's capacity for similar concern toward his 
own experience. Respect for minds generates respect for self, 
respect for other, and ultimately respect for the human commu­
nity. It is this respect that drives and organizes the therapeutic 
endeavor and speaks with greatest clarity to our psychological 
heritage.

Psychic Reality in Borderline States 
This chapter is a contribution toward understanding the difficul­
ties of severely borderline patients as they are uncovered within 
the psychoanalytic process. We consider how the pattern of 
behavior and relationship—including the transference relation­
ship—characteristics of borderline patients may be understood 
in terms of an inadequate integration of the two early modes of 
experiencing psychic reality, as elaborated in this chapter and 
summarized below. Specifically, we suggest that the borderline 
patient's failure to mentalize adequately is compounded by the 
persistence of an undifferentiated mode of representing external 
and internal experience. It is rooted in a childlike understanding 
of mental states, where feelings and ideas are construed as 
direct (or equivalent) representations of reality with consequent 
exaggeration of their importance and extension of their implica­
tions. The persistence of this mode of functioning is a self-
perpetuating consequence of the failure of mentalization. The 
experience of unconscious as well as conscious feelings and 
ideas as equivalent to physical reality inhibits individuals' capac­
ity to suspend the immediacy of their experience and create the 
psychological space to "play with reality." 
In this way, borderline individuals are forced to accept a 
mental environment where ideas are too terrifying to think about 
and feelings too intense to experience. In the long term they 
373 

^ r 
374 / Clinical Perspectives 
defensively forgo mentalization and show an intolerance of 
alternative perspectives. The extensive failure of mentalization 
only occurs, however, in individuals whose psychic reality— 
whose mental experience of themselves—was not properly estab­
lished in infancy. In place of some representations of their inter­
nal states, these individuals experience a disturbing sense of 
otherness, historically the internalization of the infantile percep­
tion of the mother, in place of the mother's image of the infant's 
self-states. This may be combined with a retreat into compelling 
fantasy, which can only be minimally integrated with percep­
tions and experiences of reality. However, we see these deficits 
as partial and most likely to be seen when feelings and thoughts 
related to attachment are aroused. 
In this chapter we expand on the theory of borderline pathol­
ogy outlined in chapter 9 using the framework of dysfunctions of 
psychic reality in addition to attachment disorganization to help

toward others was more significant in the second case, creating 
an interesting contrast; the theoretical and technical considera­
tions are, however, surprisingly similar. 
INTRODUCTION: 
THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
In chapter 6, we used both clinical and research evidence to 
show that the normal experience of psychic reality is not an 
inherent property of the mind but, rather, a developmental 
achievement. We see the child's development as normally moving 
from an experience of psychic reality where mental states are not 
depicted as representations to an increasingly complex view of 
the internal world, which has as its hallmark the capacity to 
mentalize. Initially, the child's experience of the mind is as if it 
were a recording device, with exact correspondence between 
internal state and external reality. We have used the term "psy-' Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 375 
chic equivalence" to denote this mode of functioning in order to 
emphasize that for the young child mental events are equivalent, 
in terms of power, causality, and implications, to events in the 
physical world. Equating internal and external is inevitably a 
two-way process. Not only will the small child feel compelled to 
equate appearance with reality (how it seems is how it is), but 
also thoughts and feelings—distorted by phantasy—will be pro­
jected onto external reality in a manner unmodulated by aware­
ness that the experience of the external world might have been 
distorted in this way. 
Perhaps because it can be terrifying for thoughts and feelings 
to be experienced as concretely "real," the infant develops an 
alternative way of construing mental states. In "pretend mode," 
the child experiences feelings and ideas as totally representa­
tional, or symbolic: as having no implication for the world out­
side. Only gradually, and through the close participation of 
another mind that can simultaneously hold together the child's 
pretend and serious perspectives, does the integration of these 
two modes give rise to a psychic reality in which feelings and 
ideas are known to be internal yet in close relationship with 
what is outside (Dunn 1996). 
The notion of an increasingly symbolic and reflexive aware­
ness of mental states is assumed by many psychoanalytic for­
mulations of self-development (see review in chapter 6). More 
recently, it has also come to be at the core of conceptual and 
empirical work in cognitive and developmental psychology (see 
review in chapter 5). Our formulation differs from most develop-
mentalists in considering reflective function to be a developmen­
tal achievement that is never fully acquired—that is, maintained 
across situations—and to have roots in the earliest attachment 
relationships, not just in the verbal, toddler stage. Also, our 
emphasis, along with that of other psychoanalytic authors, is 
on the self-organizing quality of mentalizing, and the implica1 
tions that individual differences in this capacity have for later 
pathology. 
We have suggested that the emergence of mentalizing is 
deeply embedded in the child's primary-object relationships, first 
in the mirroring relationship with the caregiver. This is con­
ceived somewhat differently from the traditional psychoanalytic

defensively forgo mentalization and show an intolerance of 
alternative perspectives. The extensive failure of mentalization 
only occurs, however, in individuals whose psychic reality— 
whose mental experience of themselves—was not properly estab­
lished in infancy. In place of some representations of their inter­
nal states, these individuals experience a disturbing sense of 
otherness, historically the internalization of the infantile percep­
tion of the mother, in place of the mother's image of the infant's 
self-states. This may be combined with a retreat into compelling 
fantasy, which can only be minimally integrated with percep­
tions and experiences of reality. However, we see these deficits 
as partial and most likely to be seen when feelings and thoughts 
related to attachment are aroused. 
In this chapter we expand on the theory of borderline pathol­
ogy outlined in chapter 9 using the framework of dysfunctions of 
psychic reality in addition to attachment disorganization to help 
us to understand two severe cases of borderline personality 
disorder, both of whom underwent successful five-times-weekly 
psychoanalytic treatment. Self-harm played a more central role 
in the first of the cases to be considered, whereas violence 
toward others was more significant in the second case, creating

INTRODUCTION: 
THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
In chapter 6, we used both clinical and research evidence to 
show that the normal experience of psychic reality is not an 
inherent property of the mind but, rather, a developmental 
achievement. We see the child's development as normally moving 
from an experience of psychic reality where mental states are not

in terms of power, causality, and implications, to events in the

also thoughts and feelings—distorted by phantasy—will be pro­
jected onto external reality in a manner unmodulated by aware­
ness that the experience of the external world might have been 
distorted in this way. 
Perhaps because it can be terrifying for thoughts and feelings 
to be experienced as concretely "real," the infant develops an 
alternative way of construing mental states. In "pretend mode," 
the child experiences feelings and ideas as totally representa­
tional, or symbolic: as having no implication for the world out­
side. Only gradually, and through the close participation of 
another mind that can simultaneously hold together the child's 
pretend and serious perspectives, does the integration of these 
two modes give rise to a psychic reality in which feelings and 
ideas are known to be internal yet in close relationship with 
what is outside (Dunn 1996). 
The notion of an increasingly symbolic and reflexive aware­
ness of mental states is assumed by many psychoanalytic for­
mulations of self-development (see review in chapter 6). More 
recently, it has also come to be at the core of conceptual and 
empirical work in cognitive and developmental psychology (see 
review in chapter 5). Our formulation differs from most develop-
mentalists in considering reflective function to be a developmen­
tal achievement that is never fully acquired—that is, maintained 
across situations—and to have roots in the earliest attachment 
relationships, not just in the verbal, toddler stage. Also, our 
emphasis, along with that of other psychoanalytic authors, is 
on the self-organizing quality of mentalizing, and the implica1 
tions that individual differences in this capacity have for later 
pathology. 
We have suggested that the emergence of mentalizing is 
deeply embedded in the child's primary-object relationships, first 
in the mirroring relationship with the caregiver. This is con­
ceived somewhat differently from the traditional psychoanalytic 

376 / Clinical Perspectives 
concepts of mirroring proposed by Kohut (1977), Bion (1962a), 
and Winnicott (1967). It is much more akin to the model recently 
described by Gergely and Watson (1996) and presented in chap­
ters 4 and 5. We suggest that the infant only gradually realizes 
that he has feelings and. thoughts and slowly becomes able to 
distinguish these. This happens mainly through learning that 
his internal experiences are meaningfully related to by the 
parent, through her expressions and other responses. These 
habitual: reactions to his emotional expressions focus the in­
fant's attention on his internal experiences, giving them a shape, 
so that they become meaningful and increasingly manageable. 
Primary, representations of experience are organized into second­
ary representations of these states of mind and body (Fonagy 
and Target 1997). The experience of affect is the bud from which 
eventually mentalization can grow, but only in the context of at 
least one continuing, safe attachment relationship. 
The parent who cannot think about the child's mental experi­
ence deprives him of a core self-structure that he needs to build 
a viable sense of himself. For the infant, repeated internalization 
of the mother's processed image of his thoughts and feelings 
provides "containment" (Bion 1962a); Joyce McDougall has ob­
served that "a nursling, through its cries, bodily gestures and 
somato-psychic reactions to stress, gives nonverbal communica­
tions that only a mother is able to interpret. She functions, in 
this respect, as her baby's thinking system, and finds an ad­
equate response to her infant's distress" (McDougall 1989, p. 
169). This "adequate" response involves not only interpreting the 
baby's physical expressions, but also giving him back a manage­
able version of what he is communicating (Winnicott 1967). The 
absence or distortion of this mirroring function early in life may 
lead to a desperate search for alternative ways of containing 
psychological experience and the mental world. These ways may, 
for example, come to involve various forms of self-harm or ag­
gression toward others. 
Why should such failure of attunement occur? Many factors 
may make the mother unresponsive to the baby's communica­
tion of need; most commonly perhaps, distress mobilizes unac­
ceptable anxiety. Reactions such as these disrupt the mother's Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 377 
capacity to reflect on the baby's feelings and arouse her habitual 
defenses against unmanageable affect. A. Stein (1994) demon­
strated that mothers with current diagnoses of bulimia nervosa 
had specific difficulties in responding accurately to 6-month-old 
babies, particularly in the feeding situation. They were very 
intolerant of messiness and insisted on controlling the infant's 
access to the food: As a consequence, they consistently misread 
the child's cries, and this tendency was also seen in play with 
toys. One of the most distressing observations during feeding 
was that cries of frustration and hunger were misread as rejec­
tion, of the offered food, leading to serious failure to thrive in 
some cases. In the secure relationship, the sensitivity—and, we 
might add, availability—of the caregiver (Belsky et al. 1995) 
ensures that the infant is able to find out what he feels and 
hence increasingly to feel understood. This allows him to inter­
nalize the experience of containment and develop a representa­
tional system for internal states. 
Within a secure or containing relationship, the baby's affec­
tive signals are interpreted by the parent, who is able to reflect 
on the mental states underlying the baby's distress. For this 
reflection to help the baby, it must involve a subtle combination 
of mirroring and the communication of a contrasting affect. The 
nature of the object's mirroring may be most easily understood 
in the context of our description of the parent's pretend play with 
the child: in order to contain the child's anxiety, the mother's 
mirroring expression will display a complex affect, which com­
bines fear with a conflicting emotion, such as irony. At one level, 
this communicates that there is nothing "truly" to worry about, 
but, more importantly, the parent's reaction, which is the same 
yet not the same as the baby's experience, creates the possibility 
of generating a second-order (symbolic) representation of the 
anxiety. This is the beginning of symbolization. In another pa­
per, we have discussed how in language (Fonagy and Fonagy 
1995) speakers frequently, quite unconsciously, combine two 
patterns of intonation, each characteristic of a different emotion. 
The listener is affected by both, even when only one of the affects 
expressed is consciously perceived. We believe that the infant is 
soothed (or contained) through much the same process.

378 / Clinical Perspectives 
There may be many reasons for the failure of attunement 
between infant and parent, some rooted in the parent's pathol­
ogy, others in constitutional factors, trauma, and other experi­
ences. Whatever the-reason, if the parent is unable to respond in 
the way described above, what will be internalized by the child 
will tend to be the parent's own experience or defenses; the 
infant's distress is either avoided or mirrored without first being 
"metabolized." In extreme cases, the child may be pushed toward 
the highly maladaptive defense of inhibiting mentalization. Even 
in less extreme cases, parent-child relationships in which mir­
roring has been inadequate may lay the groundwork for subse­
quent distortions of personality development in one of two ways. 
These correspond to the two modes of experiencing psychic 
reality that we described in chapter 6. The mother may echo the 
child's state without modulation, as in the mode of psychic 
equivalence, concretizing or panicking at the child's distress. 
Alternatively, she may avoid reflection on the child's affect 
through a process akin to dissociation, which effectively places 
the mother in a pretend mode, unrelated to external reality, 
including the child. The mother may then ignore the child's 
distress, or translate it into illness, tiredness, and so on. Both 
strip the child's communication of meaning that he can recog­
nize and use. It may also lead to a currency between mother and 
child of interpretation of feelings in physical terms, so that the 
physical state is the "real" thing. Lynne Murray (1992), in her 
work with mothers suffering from puerperal depression, has 
provided some vivid illustrations of such mothers offering an 
alternative reality, marked by the exaggeration associated with 
pretense but not related to the infant's experience. Psychoana­
lytic observers of this type of interaction would rapidly identify 
the operation of massive denial and even manic defense. The 
infant has not been able to find a recognizable version of his 
mental states in another person's mind, and the opportunity to 
acquire a symbolic representation-of those states has been lost. 
As shown more fully in chapters 4 and 5, normally the child 
achieves control over affect partly through this kind of symboli-
zation. The representation of his feelings is increasingly asso­
ciated with the modulation included in her reflection of his 
emotional state. The reflection is clearly related to the original Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 379 
state but is not the same. The infant will match the mother's 
modulated reaction to his own feelings and slowly learns that 
symbolic play with affect has the potential to bind his emotional 
and physiological reactions. Clinically this means that the child1 
who has not received recognizable but modified images of his 
affective states may later have trouble in differentiating reality 
from fantasy and physical from psychic reality. This may restrict 
him to an instrumental or functional (manipulative), rather than 
signal (communicative) use of affect. (See chapter 5 for the 
stages of development of agency.) 
In chapter.9 we described the way in which this instrumental 
use of affect is a key aspect of the tendency of borderline patients 
to express and cope with thoughts and feelings through physical 
action, against their own bodies or in relation to other people. 
Central in this chapter is the limitation imposed by the delayed 
or absent secondary (or metacognitive) representation of affect 
on the development of the child's psychic reality. We assume 
that the integration of the -two primitive modes of experiencing 
mind (equivalence and pretense) requires precursors of mentali­
zation. Play with reality, rather than apart from reality, will be 
possible only if the conceptual capacity for representing experi­
ence as a version of reality is present. Such integration normally 
begins in the second year of life and is partially completed by the 
fifth or sixth year. 
Common observations of the young child, toddlers, and even 
3- and 4-year-olds readily confirm that, as far as the boundaries 
of the psychological self are concerned, a young child readily 
assumes that his object's desires are the same as his own. A boy 
of 4, in a considerable temper, warned his mother that he no 
longer wanted to sleep in her bed, or have a birthday party, or 
even wished for a Megazord (a prized model from "The Power 
Rangers"). Maybe somewhat more infantile than usual because 
of his emotional'arousal, nevertheless this boy assumed that his 
mother's desires were identical to his, and her sense of loss at 
these deprivations would be as great as his. A borderline child 
treated by George Moran at the Anna Freud Centre offered food 
to the analyst when George asked whether he was hungry.

with personal pronouns as a consequence of this confusion. A

"that's my birthday too!" In brief, awareness of the physical 
separateness of bodies, and even of mental states, does not 
immediately bring with it the capacity to attribute a mental state 
appropriately or even to identify a particular person. 
The mental boundaries of the self probably remain perme­
able throughout development and perhaps even in adulthood. 
Sandler (1992) stressed the importance of primary identifica­
tion as underpinning empathic gestures (for example, correcting 
one's stance when seeing someone else slip). Normally these 
experiences are circumscribed, preconscious, and limited to the 
earlier stages of perception. Nevertheless their very existence 
underscores the importance of intersubjective states that under­
pin the development of self-knowledge. At the core of the mature 
child's self is the other at the moment of reflection. Metacog-
nitions—the mental representations of mental representations— 
are object images congruent with internal states, yet clearly not 
identical with them. They share elements of the child's self 
sufficiently coherent and stable for the formation of a symbolic 
link and for the child to construct further self-representations 
on it in the physical absence of the object. 
THE ROLE OF TRAUMA 
IN PREVENTING THE INTEGRATION 
OF THE TWO MODES OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
As shown in chapter 9, trauma plays a significant role in the 
psychogenesis of borderline states (e.g., Johnson et al. 1999). We 
suggest that when perpetrated by an attachment figure, trauma 
interferes with the developmental process described above. Evi­
dence of this can be seen in severely abused children in one or 
more of the following ways: (a) the persistence of a psychic 
equivalence mode of experiencing internal reality; (b) the propen­
sity to continue to shift into a pretend mode (e.g., through 
dissociation), (c) a partial inability to reflect on one's^own mental 
states and those of one's objects. We are suggesting that these Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 381' 
ways of thinking persist into adulthood and play an important 
role in borderline phenomena. 
The maltreated child cannot afford the luxury of seeing the 
parent's expression as indicating only a psychic reality, as 
"nonconsequential," since the parent's feelings can carry terrify­
ing repercussions. Normally, between the ages of 2 and 4 years 
the child will increasingly notice discrepancies between his in­
ternal states and the world outside, or other people's states of 
mind. However, the child who is surrounded by threat or actual 
trauma will have little opportunity to develop an awareness of 
any distinction between inner and outer; his focus on.the out­
side world and its physical and emotional dangers needs to be 
maintained so closely that" there is little room for the idea of a 
separate, internal world. In normal circumstances, a parent will 
be able to protect the child from some of the frightening force of 
reality, not so much- by concealing events and feelings, but by 
conveying to the child that there is more than one way of seeing 
things. Perhaps the chikThas seen the parent being angry, even 
frightening; if the parent is able to recognize the child's experi­
ence but also is able to communicate that that fear is unjusti­
fied, the child is safe. However, in cases of maltreatment, the 
child is not safe, and any reassuring communication of contain­
ment will be false. It will also further undermine the child's 
capacity to trust inner reality. Thus, abuse inevitably reinforces 
a lack of integration between the two infantile modes of experi­
ence of mental states. It reinforces a psychic equivalent mode of 
functioning, because it forces the child to attend primarily to the 
physical world, to mistrust any opportunities for playfulness, 
and to be suspicious of the internal world in general, because 
the object's internal world is incomprehensible, terrifying, or 
deceptive. It also reinforces a pretend mode because it may be 
the only way available to the child to sever connection between 
internal states and an intolerable external reality. 
Parents who cannot enter a mentalizing mode with their child 
(where pretend and real can coexist) are by no means always 
overtly abusive, neglecting, or mentally ill. A wide range of people 
share the type of early experience associated with insecure at­
tachment. Although frequently found in childhoods that are 
traumatic, it is by no means restricted to these. This may be one

child's self is the other at the moment of reflection. Metacog-
nitions—the mental representations of mental representations— 
are object images congruent with internal states, yet clearly not 
identical with them. They share elements of the child's self 
sufficiently coherent and stable for the formation of a symbolic 
link and for the child to construct further self-representations 
on it in the physical absence of the object. 
THE ROLE OF TRAUMA 
IN PREVENTING THE INTEGRATION 
OF THE TWO MODES OF PSYCHIC REALITY 
As shown in chapter 9, trauma plays a significant role in the 
psychogenesis of borderline states (e.g., Johnson et al. 1999). We 
suggest that when perpetrated by an attachment figure, trauma 
interferes with the developmental process described above. Evi­
dence of this can be seen in severely abused children in one or 
more of the following ways: (a) the persistence of a psychic 
equivalence mode of experiencing internal reality; (b) the propen­
sity to continue to shift into a pretend mode (e.g., through 
dissociation), (c) a partial inability to reflect on one's^own mental 
states and those of one's objects. We are suggesting that these Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 381' 
ways of thinking persist into adulthood and play an important 
role in borderline phenomena. 
The maltreated child cannot afford the luxury of seeing the 
parent's expression as indicating only a psychic reality, as 
"nonconsequential," since the parent's feelings can carry terrify­
ing repercussions. Normally, between the ages of 2 and 4 years 
the child will increasingly notice discrepancies between his in­
ternal states and the world outside, or other people's states of 
mind. However, the child who is surrounded by threat or actual 
trauma will have little opportunity to develop an awareness of 
any distinction between inner and outer; his focus on.the out­
side world and its physical and emotional dangers needs to be 
maintained so closely that" there is little room for the idea of a 
separate, internal world. In normal circumstances, a parent will 
be able to protect the child from some of the frightening force of 
reality, not so much- by concealing events and feelings, but by 
conveying to the child that there is more than one way of seeing 
things. Perhaps the chikThas seen the parent being angry, even 
frightening; if the parent is able to recognize the child's experi­
ence but also is able to communicate that that fear is unjusti­
fied, the child is safe. However, in cases of maltreatment, the 
child is not safe, and any reassuring communication of contain­
ment will be false. It will also further undermine the child's 
capacity to trust inner reality. Thus, abuse inevitably reinforces 
a lack of integration between the two infantile modes of experi­
ence of mental states. It reinforces a psychic equivalent mode of 
functioning, because it forces the child to attend primarily to the 
physical world, to mistrust any opportunities for playfulness, 
and to be suspicious of the internal world in general, because 
the object's internal world is incomprehensible, terrifying, or 
deceptive. It also reinforces a pretend mode because it may be 
the only way available to the child to sever connection between 
internal states and an intolerable external reality. 
Parents who cannot enter a mentalizing mode with their child 
(where pretend and real can coexist) are by no means always 
overtly abusive, neglecting, or mentally ill. A wide range of people 
share the type of early experience associated with insecure at­
tachment. Although frequently found in childhoods that are 
traumatic, it is by no means restricted to these. This may be one 

382 / Clinical Perspectives 
of the reasons why many characteristics of children who have 
experienced severe maltreatment may also be found in those 
whose childhoods have apparently been relatively benign. The 
parent may have been unable to reveal herself enough to the 
child, preventing him from finding himself within her mind. We 
speculate that the capacity on the parent's part to adopt a 
playfully empathic attitude may be essential for the child to 
experience his projections as contained. Instead, the parent may 
be emotionally inaccessible to the child, preventing him from 
creating an image of his internal world in the parent's mind, 
which would then have been available for internalization to form 
the core sense of himself. Some parents may in addition uncon­
sciously reveal states of mind (hatred, disgust) that, if pervasive, 
constitute psychological abuse, because the child has to recoil 
from the implied1 image of himself. The most disturbing aspect 
for the child might be to contemplate the cruelty or hatred the 
caregiver feels toward him. He can have no protection from this, 
other than barring ideas about feelings and thoughts in others 
and in himself from his consciousness. The maltreated child can 
thus grow up to fear minds and to repudiate awareness of 
feelings or motives, with the persistence of psychic equivalence 
as the inevitable by-product of this process. 
Furthermore, as Main and Hesse (1992) have pointed out, it 
is as disruptive for the parent to be experienced as frightened as 
for her to be seen as frightening. There may be at least two 
processes in operation here: (a) Because at this early stage the 
infant perceives the object as part of the self, the child will tend 
to assume that his own mental state is dangerous or even 
catastrophic, because it is associated' with frightening behavior 
from the parent. For instance, a baby might bite the mother's 
breast in excited: pleasure and find a reaction of anger and 
rejection. If such experiences were frequent, then they could be 
expected to have a disorganizing effect on the baby's under­
standing of his own states of mind; excited pleasure becomes 
equated with anger and rejection, (b) The child may perceive the 
caregiver's image of him as a frightening, unmanageable per­
son—for instance, a reminder of an abusive figure from the 
mother's own history—and this may be internalized as an unac-
ceptable'and confusing part of the child's self-image. (In chapter Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 383 
6 we discussed the role that this process may have played in the 
case of Rebecca.) 
Trauma may also disrupt the representation of feelings or 
thoughts by creating a propensity for shifting into the infantile 
mode of pretend. Some traumatized children grow up with an 
apparent hypersensitivity to mental states, needing to guess 
immediately what those around them feel and think in order to 
preempt further trauma. As part of this, a pseudo-knowledge of 
minds can develop, which is superficial and may be very selec­
tive, scanning for particular danger signals and avoiding reflec­
tion on meanings or connections. What seems to result is a 
keenness to identify psychological states in others, but these 
states are essentially meaningless to the patient, a common but 
heavily devalued currency. "Expertise" in the psychological world 
of the other develops at the expense of knowledge of the patient's 
own mind. This thinking, which in research we have called 
"hyperactive mentalizing," occurs in the pretend mode, without 
firm ties to internal and external experience that is felt to be real. 
An example may be helpful. "Sandra" is a 35-year-old woman 
with a twenty-year history of self-mutilation and suicidal ges­
tures and a background of psychological abuse from the grand­
mother who brought her up.1 In the first part of her analysis, 
Sandra was endlessly preoccupied with analyzing the motives 
behind the reportedly cruel and paranoid behavior of her grand­
mother and her psychiatrist. The events described, whether from 
childhood or yesterday, had a hackneyed quality, like a soap 
opera. The motives that Sandra attributed to the offending char­
acters were unconvincing and quite interchangeable. They were 
also often transparently projected. Sandra habitually twisted her 
reflective function, deflecting attention from her own mental 
states and distorting or negating those of other people. Her 
systematic abuse of mentalization protected her from actual 
insight or intimacy. Her reflective capacity seemed to have been 
hijacked into the pretend mode of experience, in which psycho­
logical events, like her relationships, were idealized but emptied 
of emotional depth. An illustration of this was that, after a night 
of self-cutting and getting her 9-year-old son to help her write a

suicide note, Sandra came to her session excitedly trying to

mentioning in passing her own outbursts of the previous day. 
More commonly, mindless or cruel treatment of a child leads 
to the rejection of mentalization (Fonagy, Steele, Steele, and 
Target 1997). This should be thought about not simply as a 
deficit, but as an adaptation that has helped the child to attain 
some distance from a traumatizing situation (see chapter 7 for a 
clear example). Although restriction of mentalization was origi­
nally adaptive, there is a clear and powerful link between this 
restricted capacity and vulnerability to later trauma. The inabil­
ity to reflect upon the mental state of the perpetrator, as well as 
the reaction of the self, may prevent the child from resolving the 
original traumatic experience or coping with subsequent assault. 
Conversely, mentalizing is an important component of the self-
righting capacity of individuals who are able to withstand early 
adversity (Fonagy, Steele, et al. 1994). There is a mutual devel­
opmental relationship between trauma and mentalizing; trauma 
may undermine the child's willingness to play with feelings and 
ideas (felt as too real) in relation to external events, but, at the 
same time, the lack of a full mentalizing mode of internal organi­
zation will create a propensity for the continuous repetition of 
the trauma, in the absence of the modulation that a representa­
tional view of psychic reality would bring. 
THE RIGIDITY OF RELATIONSHIP PATTERNS 
AND THE PETRIFICATION OF SYSTEMS 
OF REPRESENTATION 
As described in chapter 9, one of the most characteristic features 
of borderline psychopathology is the instability and tempestu-
ousness of relationships. These show a rapidly accelerating 
tempo, where intimacy immediately follows acquaintance, and 
there are numerous crises, often featuring dependence, maso­
chism, and dominance. In fact, we may say, paraphrasing Win-Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 385 
nicott, that in some sense "there is no such thing as a borderline 
person, there is only the borderline couple—the borderline per­
son and her object." However, these patients tend to lack a 
realistic sense of the psychic reality of the other person. What is 
represented is an association between a self-state and the state 
in a "virtual other" that is not consistently plausible. For exam­
ple, Sandra talked extensively about friends, but the feelings and 
thoughts attributed to them were often improbable and incon­
sistent with their actions. In the narrative, these people felt two-
dimensional, and as the patient incorporated the analyst into 
the cast of characters, the analyst strongly felt a shallowness 
and artificiality in the way she was represented. This was not 
like the elaboration of distortions as transferences developed; 
rather, it felt like being a joker in a card game, which could 
stand for any other card but had no actual identity or continuity. 
While all psychoanalytic treatment is likely to develop a 
capacity for reflective function in the patient (and in the analyst), 
work with borderline patients suggests that the stunting or 
twisting of this capacity may be a key to their pathology. Treat­
ment then needs to be intensively—though not necessarily 
directly—focused on its development. We suggest that some 
aspects of borderline pathology arise from the inadequate inte­
gration of early forms of the representation of internal experi­
ence, which would normally form the basis of a mentalizing 
mode of experiencing psychic reality. Perhaps the single most 
important indicator of this is the quality of rigidity that imbues 
the internal representational world, the experience of the self, 
and relationships with others. 
Borderline patients persist in particular patterns of relating 
with a tenacity far beyond that associated with habitual de­
fenses. These individuals, like other patients, organize the ana­
lytic relationship to conform to their unconscious expectations, 
but for borderline patients these expectations have the full force 
of reality and there is no sense of alternative perspectives. At 
moments when external reality does not fit with the tenaciously 
held active schema, there is emptiness and confusion. 
Just as behavior and interpersonal relations are rigidly 
restricted, so is internal experience; of the total spectrum of

experiences, only some are registered- and felt, leading to a 
discontinuity in self-experience. Because of the lack of flexibility 
of the representational system for mental states, the individual 
cannot evoke psychic experiences other than by enactment and 
provocation. Subjective states, such as anxiety, may be known 
mainly through creating them in another person. Many have 
explained the manipulative aspects of eating disorders and other 
forms of self-harm (e.g., Bruch 1982; T. Main 1957) in terms of 
the projection or projective identification of intolerable parts 
of the self, or as part of communication. Here our emphasis is 
somewhat different. It is the creation of an internal experience 
akin to reflection, normally intrapsychic, that is established 
through interpersonal interaction. Not being able to feel them­
selves from within, they are forced to experience the self from 
without. Sandra, at various times of crisis, said she knew that 
she had been overwhelmed with anxiety because her son had 
called the police, or her analyst had talked to her psychiatrist. 
These reactions made sense of what she had felt to be a "mental 
mess," and she was then somewhat more able to deal with it 
appropriately. 
An important aspect of such rigidity is the persistence of 
psychic equivalence as a predominant mode of experiencing 
psychic reality. Much of the apparent inflexibility of such pa­
tients may be understood in terms of the increased weight they 
give to psychic reality. When mental experience cannot be con­
ceived of in a symbolic way, thoughts and feelings have a direct 
and sometimes devastating impact that can only be avoided 
through drastic and primitive defensive moves. 
Early in his analysis, one male patient reported a very acri­
monious argument between himself and a shop assistant about 
the change he was given."/ knew I gave her five pounds, but the 
stupid woman only gave me 30 pence change, when she should 
have given me 80. She kept saying that she gave me 80 pence, 
but I knew that she had kept 50." What was interesting from an 
analytic standpoint in his account was not simply his obvious 
sense of omnipotence in relation to her (i.e., "he knew") and the 
sense of betrayal by the analyst in the transference, but his 
inability to contemplate any other point of view. Reflecting on 
this episode some years into his analysis, he said: "I just could Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 387 
not see any possibility, other than I was right; it's not that I did 
not want to see it, it simply did not exist." 
A borderline young man treated by Peter Fonagy and de­
scribed more fully in an earlier paper (Fonagy 1991) was prone to 
long periods of silence during an early phase of his analysis. The 
silences were impenetrable and, for some time, unexplained. On 
one occasion, the trigger was a two-minute delay in the analyst's 
arrival for the session, which led to over a week of silence. 
Interpreting the silence as punishing the analyst, communicat­
ing frustration, or a sense of being excluded or not understood 
failed to break the deadlock. Eventually it transpired that on this 
and many other occasions the analyst's lateness created an 
image of being with someone uncaring and unreliable to the 
point of being mad. "You are just an unprofessional, uncaring 
bastard, and you know it." At those times, the analyst was 
experienced as someone^totally unsafe to be with, and question­
ing this perception carried no meaning. 
While there is little that was unusual about this transference 
image, it was held with enormous tenacity, impervious to any 
consideration of other times that had been experienced equally 
definitively as showing an opposite reality. Each view replaced 
the other completely, and each was seen as so clear that it was 
not even worth discussing. The analyst saw that as based in a 
lack of ability to "play with reality"; the patient was mesmerized 
by an idea and unable to experience it as psychic rather than 
physical reality. The analyst had to accept the distortion. At­
tempting to evoke the patient's complete picture of the analyst 
was inevitably perceived as an attack on the patient's sanity. 
While often not consciously aware of this, we respect it by 
entering the patient's reality and accepting the role of the "un­
professional, uncaring bastard," or whatever it may be. 
We now describe work with a patient whose difficulties illus­
trate many of the theoretical points we have been putting for­
ward. We then discuss more specifically some aspects of the 
failure to achieve full mentalization in adults with severe person­
ality disorder and the way in which, using borderline disorder 
as an example, such states may be understood in terms of 
the persistence of primitive modes of understanding psychic

DYSFUNCTIONAL PSYCHIC REALITY 
IN SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS— 
CLINICAL EXAMPLE: "EMMA" 
Emma? at 19 was a slightly overweight, highly intelligent young 
woman, looking younger than her years. She was referred to us 
at the Anna Freud Centre from another center because her 
diabetes had been hopelessly out of control since she was first 
diagnosed diabetic at the age of 12. She openly admitted to 
manipulating her insulin to control her weight. She had been 
hospitalized with keto-acidosis eight times during the previous 
year. After her last admission her diabetologist, who is renowned 
for his antipsychoanalytic sentiment, agreed to the psychoana­
lytic referral with the comment: "We might as well let somebody 
else watch her kill herself." 
When Emma was assessed, her main concern was about her 
imminent failure in her Arts Foundation Course, for which she 
found herself unable to submit the necessary course-work. She 
was living on her own in a tiny single room and spending her 
money on drugs, alcohol, and vast quantities of "bad" food. She 
smoked cannabis and heroin, drank excessively, and binged on 
potatochips, chocolate, cheese, and cakes. She would "burn off' 
the carbohydrates by omitting insulin and abusing alcohol. The

manic-depressive. During her mother's psychotic episodes, and 
later during her physical illness, Emma was looked after by her 
three older sisters, the family's neighbors, or whoever happened 
to be around at the time. From her accounts it seems clear that 
despite being the youngest, her role in the family was a pivotal 
one. As the youngest child, she was the person around whom the 
family rallied and whose survival justified the continued exist­
ence of the family unit. Soon after she turned 10 the burden she 
had assumed as peacemaker in family arguments became even 
heavier when her brother and sisters as well as her mother 
began approaching her for advice. It was apparent in the way 
she described the interminable family conversations, sometimes 
reaching far into the night, that even as a relatively young girl 
she had a capacity to create in her mind a little space where she 
was able to deal with other people's confusions in a rational, 
even if not yet mature, way. She referred to this in a disparaging 
way as being a "rubbish bin" for other people's troubles. Yet she 
also recalled feeling valued and appreciated. Thus, she had some 
capacity to mentalize, even if this could only be achieved at 
substantial cost, by needing those around her to represent the 
confused and unthinking parts of herself. 
Emma's father's psychiatric disturbance was probably as 
severe as her mother's. Emma recalls a very early memory of her 
father screaming through the house, turning all the children out 
of their beds, and making them stand outside in the garden so 
that the "evil spirits'' would not possess their souls. She also 
recalls violent battles between her parents, when they would set 
about each other with ferocious intensity. Her father left the 
home when Emma was 6 years old, and his departure was both 
sudden and unexplained. He continued to live in the same 
provincial English town and kept up superficial contact with the 
children. He was, however, out of work and in and out of psychi­
atric hospitals and offered the family little by way of physical or 
psychological support. 
Emma spoke warmly about her mother, as someone who was 
trying to do her best in very difficult circumstances. What united 
the family was their war of attrition with Social Services, who 
repeatedly threatened to take the children into care, particularly 
at times when their mother's illness became acute. There clearly

DYSFUNCTIONAL PSYCHIC REALITY 
IN SELF-DESTRUCTIVENESS— 
CLINICAL EXAMPLE: "EMMA" 
Emma? at 19 was a slightly overweight, highly intelligent young 
woman, looking younger than her years. She was referred to us 
at the Anna Freud Centre from another center because her 
diabetes had been hopelessly out of control since she was first 
diagnosed diabetic at the age of 12. She openly admitted to 
manipulating her insulin to control her weight. She had been 
hospitalized with keto-acidosis eight times during the previous 
year. After her last admission her diabetologist, who is renowned 
for his antipsychoanalytic sentiment, agreed to the psychoana­
lytic referral with the comment: "We might as well let somebody 
else watch her kill herself." 
When Emma was assessed, her main concern was about her 
imminent failure in her Arts Foundation Course, for which she 
found herself unable to submit the necessary course-work. She 
was living on her own in a tiny single room and spending her 
money on drugs, alcohol, and vast quantities of "bad" food. She 
smoked cannabis and heroin, drank excessively, and binged on 
potatochips, chocolate, cheese, and cakes. She would "burn off' 
the carbohydrates by omitting insulin and abusing alcohol. The 
alcohol would also anesthetize her, as would the cannabis. The 
most dramatic expression of aggression was in the lacerations 
she inflicted on herself with a razor blade. She described the 
triggers for such acts as a "sinister little voice" inside her head, 
tempting and daring her to self-mutilate: "You' know you'll feel

was a desperate bond between the mother and the children. 
Emma recalls pretending to a social worker that her mother was 
out shopping when in fact her brother and sister were holding 
her down and trying to stop her from cutting her wrists. When 
mother was hospitalized, the children would go and visit her 
regularly, despite the fact that the hospital was far away. 
Her mother .became ill with a rapidly disseminating cancer 
when Emma was 8. She underwent a radical mastectomy and a 
further operation on her neck. Finally, in the last stages of the 
illness, Emma's mother took her own life. 
Emma emphatically did not want to come into treatment. Her 
reasons for this were both complex and telling. Having treatment 
was escaping—"not facing the music." She should be able to 
battle it out on her own. I said to her that I understood how hard 
it must be for her to contemplate receiving help when so many of 
her good feelings about herself were to do with being the one who 
could help her sisters and her mother. At this point she began to 
weep and told me that she had heard, at the Bulimics Anony­
mous group she had once attended, that I knew about diabetics. 
I said that perhaps she was concerned that I might think that I 
knew about her, whereas she knew that nobody could really 
know about the impossibility of her situation. She went on to say 
that none of the people at the hospital understood what she was 
going through. "They all think I am a naughty child, wanting to 
get attention, and when ignoring me doesn't work, they just 
don't know how to deal with me. But I really don't care about 
what they do, they are no use to me." I said that perhaps she felt 
worried about the prospect of psychoanalysis because it might 
be a situation in which she would mind whether she was ignored 
or not. She said that she could not imagine that coming to see 
someone every day would do anything except make the person 
an addict, as food and heroin did, "except that food and heroin 
are up to me and in psychoanalysis you are in control." I sug­
gested that she might be far more worried about being out of 
control than she knew. Furthermore, if she could force the 
doctors at the hospital to lose their tempers with her, she might 
also be able to force an analyst to lose control. 
Many months into the analysis she told me how important 
this interview had been for her, in that she felt I was aware of her Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 391 
need to create madness and confusion in me, in the treatment. 
In the first months of the analysis her anxieties about the 
destructiveness of her thoughts and fantasies often caused her 
to be silent, sometimes to remain so for entire, sessions. She 
would attend punctually, despite a long and complex journey, 
but then she would just lie on the couch, make a few apparently 
superficial comments about the journey or about the room or 
even about the weather, and then lapse into a state of self-
imposed quarantine. 
At no stage did one have the feeling, however, that she did not 
wish to communicate. I attended carefully to her body move­
ments and from time to time commented on what I thought 
these said about her current mental state (and this, in an 
unremarkable nutshell, is the essence of our technique): the 
constant availability and active offering of the analyst's mind so 
that within it she may discover her own self. For example, on one 
occasion, when she greeted me at the beginning of the session 
but then said nothing else, I noticed how she took out her bus 
pass and pressed it against her fingers until it was bent almost 
double under the pressure, then she released it, allowing it to 
snap back into its normal shape. She repeated the movement 
exactly five times. I said that perhaps she wanted me to know 
what an effort it felt to have to come and see me five times a 
week. Realizing that I must have been reacting to what she was 
doing with her bus pass, she.tucked it away into her purse. The 
action was incomplete and the bus pass disappeared only half­
way, so that the part with her photograph on it was still sticking 
out, as if peering over the edge. I said that I understood that a 
frightened part was always on the look-out to make sure that 
nothing had been revealed inadvertently, but that there was 
another part of her that wanted me to understand her, and no 
matter how hard the frightened part might try to ensure that 
everything was carefully tucked away, this other more communi­
cative part of her would leave a nice clear trail for me to follow. 
She then said indignantly: "What do you mean, communicative? 
I could no more communicate to you than I could talk to Me­
dusa." I said: "You know, even Medusa could be confronted with 
the help of a mirror." She turned away so that I would not be 
able to see her face, but I could tell that she was smiling.

The moment when she decided that she wanted to talk was 
rather dramatic and illustrates both the nature of her pathology 
and the clinical approach that we take in dealing with borderline 
patients. I had been told, not by her but by the physician 
treating her, that she was about to undergo a fundoscopy to 
check for diabetic retinopathy. Fundoscopy involves instilling a 
mydriatic into the eye to dilate the pupil and causes a temporary 
blurring of vision. She came into the session directly after her 
investigation and uncharacteristically avoided looking at me and 
lay on the couch, burying her head in the cushion. The silence 
lasted for at least ten minutes. Eventually I noticed that her 
index finger was tracing small grooves almost imperceptibly in 
the texture of the couch. Fascinated, I thought the grooves she 
was tracing looked like rivers and their tributaries and also like 
the small blood vessels that are involved in diabetic retinopathy. 
It then struck me that Emma was tracing two rivers that some­
times seemed to be joined up by their tributaries but sometimes 
drifted sharply away from one another. When I was reasonably 
confident of the pattern, I wondered aloud if she didn't suddenly 
feel that she might lose me, even if she did not quite understand 
why she feared this. In response she buried her face even deeper 
in the cushion. I said that we both realized how terrified she was 
of losing her sight, but that perhaps there was also a part of her 
that felt that if she could not keep an eye on things, the analysis 
might break up, and everything would become blurred. She 
remained silent.but drove her fingernail deeper and deeper into 
the couch. Eventually she was violently crisscrossing over what 
had been the river pattern. I said that I knew that somewhere 
she felt deeply ashamed about what was happening to her body 
and was very angry with the analysis and with me for just 
standing by and watching it happen. She then broke her silence. 
She said, almost shouting: "If you are so fucking clever, why 
don't you stop me from doing this before I go blind?" Reflecting 
on Emma's sense of helplessness and the helplessness she en­
gendered in me, I remarked: "I think you would like me to stop 
you from feeling the sadness and the rage that drive you to do 
this to yourself. I think you are frightened that if we come 
together to see the feelings that lead you to hurt yourself, it will 
become so unbearable that we will both be destroyed." Emma Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 393 
was quite still for a moment and then said: "I suppose it would 
not do if I asked what it is that you want to know?" 
This point in Emma's analysis, and in that of numerous other 
such self-harming and self-destructive patients whom we have 
treated, represented a spoken or unspoken realization on the 
part of these patients that they are more frightened of their 
mental experience, their emotions and phantasies, than of the 
immediate physical pain of the long-term consequences of their 
self-destructive actions, such as Emma's mismanagement of her 
diabetes. 
The central theme of Emma's analysis concerned the ex­
ternalization—which to her was real—of her confusion and 
madness. Because she was operating in a mode of psychic equiv­
alence, she felt as though these aspects of her experience really 
had left her mind, and the calmness that was left felt like her real 
self. The person who had been in turmoil, who was insanely 
ravaging her own body, was not she. Frequently, in her free 
association and dreams, she described the image of a bubble or a 
vessel stuck in outer space. She elaborated such images mostly 
in tranquil terms. For example, she referred to watching lights 
flicker from her space capsule, imagining that each was a light 
from a person too far away to seem human. However, whenever 
she seemed to feel that she had had a good analytic experience, 
anxiety would tend to overwhelm the sense of calmness. The 
reality of our relationship as analyst and patient seemed to make 
it impossible for her to maintain the conviction of madness and 
disturbance being somewhere else. On one occasion, I com­
mented on her fear that if she abandoned her seclusion, the 
alternative was madness. Responding, characteristically seeing 
her mental state in me, as if it was I who was terrified, she said: 
"Don't worry, its important to let things float a bit." 
For example she fantasized that my garden was the only 
ordered, well-kept one in the area, in the middle of a veritable 
jungle of weeds and overgrown grass of the neighboring gardens. 
When I pointed out how frightening it must be to feel surrounded 
by the menace of such chaos, she shrugged: "Well, that's your 
problem, isn't it?"

when she inflicted pain and damage on herself through gross

Her self-esteem and grandiosity were noticeably enhanced

diabetic mismanagement. She flaunted her ill-treatment of her­
self constantly and conveyed her capacity calmly to damage or 
kill herself. She imagined me to be "pleading" with her to take 
care of herself, like her relatives and the staff of the medical 
(endocrine) unit, who had spared little effort to keep her alive. 
On one occasion she entered the consulting-room and told me 
that she had just tested her blood sugar. It was so high, she 
boasted, that it no longer registered on the glucometer. She gave 
off a pungent odor of ketones, like nail-varnish remover. I replied 
that she seemed to feel so triumphant over pain and the fear of 
death that there was nothing I could offer that could compare. 
She said, "When you are diabetic, you have to have something to 
feel good about." This seemed to show that experiencing her 
psychic reality in a mode of psychic equivalence enabled her to 
feel that she had destroyed parts of her mind externalized into 
the body, as well as triumphing over death. 
In the analysis she created a shallow, half-hearted concern 
for her objects and for me in the transference. I was aware of 
being kept at a distance from something she felt was highly 
dangerous. I was also aware of the tendency to let myself drift 
into a state of near-complete inattentiveness. I understood this 
countertransference to derive from my reluctance to allow myself 
to experience her terror in the face of relating to the part of her 
mind representing her mentally ill parents of the past. Likewise, 
externalized in the transference, she reacted" to me with tenta-
tiveness for fear that I was unstable and could respond at any 
moment with mad rage. 
One day, when it was possible to smell her ketotic state 
several meters from the waiting-room and f could discern from 
her slurred speech and general vagueness that she was pro­
foundly unwell, her conscious thoughts seemed to be taken up 
with my state of health. Her fantasy was that I was suffering 
continuously from a cold because I worked too hard. She was 
confident that work was my way of avoiding depression. When I 
put it to her that I thought she was telling me how hard she felt 
she had to work to protect us from her sadness, she responded 
facetiously: "Well, one does what one can." 
At this stage it seemed to be necessary for the analysis to 
represent that part of Emma's mind which she endeavored to keep safe and tranquil and isolated; the pressure on me to mold 
my responses to her expectations was intense, because per­
ceiving any unexpected feelings and thoughts from me, and 
hence having to see me as a real person with a separate reality, 
constantly threatened to confuse and overwhelm her. 
Her careful monitoring of my well-being (again, a characteris­
tic hypervigilance) was a key feature of this transference. She 
faced an insoluble dilemma in needing me to be mad but being 
terrified by the perception of my madness—that is, finding her 
madness within me. These aspects were particularly vividly illus­
trated by the following episode: about two years into Emma's 
analysis, I was involved in a small bicycle accident, which led to 
quite significant bruising on my forehead as well as a sizeable 
cut above my right eye, which required stitches. The total effect, 
which included an extremely bloodshot eye, was as unattractive 
as it was dramatic. Equally striking was Emma's capacity to 
scotomize my injury. When I collected Emma from the waiting-
room she avoided even glancing at me. She went through the 
session mostly in silence. The only way of knowing that some­
thing was amiss was that the atmosphere of the session had a 
dreaminess about it in which it was almost impossible to sustain 
any kind of alertness or concentration. This gave a sense of 
Emma's state of mind as it tried to grapple with her fantasies 
about the injury through striving for a state of almost complete 
dissociation. We would understand this on a very pathological 
form of a pretend mode of experiencing psychic reality: Emma 
was desperately trying to create a state of mind that had no 
connection with external reality, in which her thoughts and 
imaginings had no power. At the end of the session she walked 
out of the room without looking at me, and she again seemed to 
take no notice of my face at the beginning of next day's session. 
In this session, unusually, Emma reported a dream in which 
a number of horses had broken out of their stables. They were 
blind and threatened to trample all over her. She woke up just 
before the horses were upon her. The dream seemed to be 
vaguely connected to Peter Shaffer's play, Equus. In her associa­
tions it was difficult to tell when she was recounting the dream 
and when she was giving a highly distorted account of the play. 
In Emma's version of the play, the boy, who was in a hospital for

diabetic mismanagement. She flaunted her ill-treatment of her­
self constantly and conveyed her capacity calmly to damage or 
kill herself. She imagined me to be "pleading" with her to take 
care of herself, like her relatives and the staff of the medical 
(endocrine) unit, who had spared little effort to keep her alive. 
On one occasion she entered the consulting-room and told me 
that she had just tested her blood sugar. It was so high, she 
boasted, that it no longer registered on the glucometer. She gave 
off a pungent odor of ketones, like nail-varnish remover. I replied 
that she seemed to feel so triumphant over pain and the fear of 
death that there was nothing I could offer that could compare. 
She said, "When you are diabetic, you have to have something to 
feel good about." This seemed to show that experiencing her 
psychic reality in a mode of psychic equivalence enabled her to 
feel that she had destroyed parts of her mind externalized into 
the body, as well as triumphing over death. 
In the analysis she created a shallow, half-hearted concern 
for her objects and for me in the transference. I was aware of 
being kept at a distance from something she felt was highly 
dangerous. I was also aware of the tendency to let myself drift 
into a state of near-complete inattentiveness. I understood this 
countertransference to derive from my reluctance to allow myself 
to experience her terror in the face of relating to the part of her 
mind representing her mentally ill parents of the past. Likewise, 
externalized in the transference, she reacted" to me with tenta-
tiveness for fear that I was unstable and could respond at any 
moment with mad rage. 
One day, when it was possible to smell her ketotic state 
several meters from the waiting-room and f could discern from 
her slurred speech and general vagueness that she was pro­
foundly unwell, her conscious thoughts seemed to be taken up 
with my state of health. Her fantasy was that I was suffering 
continuously from a cold because I worked too hard. She was 
confident that work was my way of avoiding depression. When I 
put it to her that I thought she was telling me how hard she felt 
she had to work to protect us from her sadness, she responded 
facetiously: "Well, one does what one can." 
At this stage it seemed to be necessary for the analysis to 
represent that part of Emma's mind which she endeavored to keep safe and tranquil and isolated; the pressure on me to mold 
my responses to her expectations was intense, because per­
ceiving any unexpected feelings and thoughts from me, and 
hence having to see me as a real person with a separate reality, 
constantly threatened to confuse and overwhelm her. 
Her careful monitoring of my well-being (again, a characteris­
tic hypervigilance) was a key feature of this transference. She 
faced an insoluble dilemma in needing me to be mad but being 
terrified by the perception of my madness—that is, finding her 
madness within me. These aspects were particularly vividly illus­
trated by the following episode: about two years into Emma's 
analysis, I was involved in a small bicycle accident, which led to 
quite significant bruising on my forehead as well as a sizeable 
cut above my right eye, which required stitches. The total effect, 
which included an extremely bloodshot eye, was as unattractive 
as it was dramatic. Equally striking was Emma's capacity to 
scotomize my injury. When I collected Emma from the waiting-
room she avoided even glancing at me. She went through the 
session mostly in silence. The only way of knowing that some­
thing was amiss was that the atmosphere of the session had a 
dreaminess about it in which it was almost impossible to sustain 
any kind of alertness or concentration. This gave a sense of 
Emma's state of mind as it tried to grapple with her fantasies 
about the injury through striving for a state of almost complete 
dissociation. We would understand this on a very pathological 
form of a pretend mode of experiencing psychic reality: Emma 
was desperately trying to create a state of mind that had no 
connection with external reality, in which her thoughts and 
imaginings had no power. At the end of the session she walked 
out of the room without looking at me, and she again seemed to 
take no notice of my face at the beginning of next day's session. 
In this session, unusually, Emma reported a dream in which 
a number of horses had broken out of their stables. They were 
blind and threatened to trample all over her. She woke up just 
before the horses were upon her. The dream seemed to be 
vaguely connected to Peter Shaffer's play, Equus. In her associa­
tions it was difficult to tell when she was recounting the dream 
and when she was giving a highly distorted account of the play. 
In Emma's version of the play, the boy, who was in a hospital for

the violently insane, developed hysterical blindness after he had 
flown into a rage and blinded a horse. The focus of her account, 
however, was the insanity of the psychiatrist treating the boy, 
who was, according to her, the villain of the piece. 
I said I thought that Emma was terrified in case somehow her 
anger might break out of the stables she created for it and make 
everyone in our "analytic hospital" violent and mad. She re­
sponded that the night before she had been so anxious about not 
being able to see that she could not take her insulin. She found 
that the pain of hyperglycemia distracted her. Nevertheless, she 
still had to smoke heroin to get to sleep. She went on to wonder 
why people talked of "blind rage." I said that it was so painful for 
her to see the manifestations of violence that being blind was 
almost preferable. And yesterday, when she had noticed my 
facial injury, she had suddenly felt that she was in terrible 
danger because she was evidently unable to keep the violence 
out of the room. 
She now became extremely anxious and asked repeatedly 
what injury I was talking about. I replied that I understood how 
frightening it was for her to feel that there had been violence, 
because it made her feel both as if she might, inadvertently have 
caused it and also as if it were happening to her. She shouted 
that I was talking nonsense, like the psychiatrist in the play. 
How could I expect her to be able to see things if I could not 
make my meanings clear to her? I said that these thoughts were 
particularly frightening because if she found that I was mad, I 
might terrify her and drive her insane. 
She was silent for a while. Then slowly and very deliberately 
she said: "I must have seen your eyes yesterday because I have 
not been able to get a picture out of my mind since then. The 
first time I remember visiting my mother in hospital, I could not 
recognize her because one of the other patients had hit her and 
given her a black eye." She recalled feeling terrified of her mother 
and responsible for her injury. 
The infantile perception of the mother was part of Emma's 
self-representation and contained, her own unintegrated aggres­
sive wishes. It could only be dealt with as part of her body, not as 
a mental representation that could be thought about consciously 
or unconsciously. In a less damaged patient it may have been Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 397 
repudiated and thus avoided—but this would assume a capacity 
to mentalize, which*was not, at this stage, within Emma's capa­
bilities. The fusion of self with the nonreflective mother consti­
tuted an overwhelming threat to the fragile, sane part of her 
self-representation that she, and all those around her, clearly 
valued. To conserve this limited self-representational structure, 
the representation of mother's mental state within the self was 
externalized into her body, where it could be attacked and per­
haps destroyed. Emma's insane acts of self-destruction para­
doxically helped her to deny the presence of her mother within 
her mind and were associated with relief and hope because 
within her immature mode of responding to mental states, domi­
nated by psychic equivalence, these acts signaled the restored 
integrity of her self-representation. Although she enacted de­
structive wishes on her body, she experienced these acts as safe, 
inconsequential, and even desirable, because the body upon 
which they were perpetrated was alien and deliberately excluded 
from her sense of self. 
It was only when conflicts surrounding the emotional invest­
ment in the object representation of her mother as a separate 
being (outside the self-representation) could become the focus of 
the analysis that her fear of loss of love and its relation to her 
self-injury could be clarified. In her material, as in her actions, 
physical closeness to death (in keto-acidosis) represented the 
only possible way of achieving mental closeness to her mother as 
the object who had her in mind. As she improved, she increas­
ingly feared that the ghost of her mother was in the consulting-
room. To illustrate, we will now describe a Monday session. 
She began the session by reporting a dream about a bomb 
threat, she described the intense fear she felt and the conflict 
over whether to stay in the building. In her associations she told 
me that she felt terrific physically, now that she had stopped 
eating animal products, and that when she was keto-acidotic, 
she felt vital and somehow real. She said she had loads of life left 
in her. I replied: "You seem to feel alive and real when you are on 
the edge of a disaster and your life is actually in danger." I added 
that it was at such times that she seemed to feel I was most 
worried about her. She said: "How did you know that I did not 
take my insulin last night?"

She said angrily that she felt that there was this evil inside 
her, that.perhaps it could only be exorcized by some "physical 
means," not by talking alone. She then had an image of injecting 
insulin into an empty shell. This was followed by a long lecture 
on the way that confidence can affect your appearance. She was 
particularly struck by French women who, by wearing appropri­
ate clothes, were able to make themselves almost beautiful. She 
wondered vaguely if there was such a thing as real beauty. I 
responded: "You seem frightened that I might recognize some­
thing good in you, that I might be taken in and find you appeal­
ing as a person." 
Her voice dropped an octave. "You despise me, don't you? You 
must do." She then went on the attack. When she deliberately 
cut her leg the other day she was terrified, because she had not 
felt a thing. Dr. Y had looked into her eye at the clinic and had 
shaken, his head. He, too, must be wondering what the analysis 
was achieving. For two years she had been coming, and things 
were, if anything, worse now than they had ever been. She 
couldn't afford another year of not getting better. I said: "You are 
frightened that you are too ill ever to feel loved." 
She paused and then spoke of her Bible reading in the eve­
nings. The previous night she had read the passage on the 
judgment of Solomon in which King Solomon was confronted by 
two women who both claimed to be the mother of the same baby. 
She emphasized with horror that the wrong mother had the live 
baby and the innocent mother had the dead baby, again empha­
sizing that it was the wrong one. Despite reading the passage 
again and again, Emma could not see why, if Solomon was wise, 
he had said that they should cut the baby in half and divide it 
between the mothers. I remarked: "You feel that 'something is 
wrong,' that the part of you that can be cared about is dead, and 
you are terrified in case you may stop me from being able to see 
the difference between what is alive and what is dead. Then you 
will be in the care of an analyst who is not capable of keeping his 
patients alive." I held back the more important interpretation, 
that she could not understand why splitting the baby in two 
would be of concern, as in her phantasy the unity of her body did 
not contain her mental existence and thus made no sense to her 
as the focus of the object's concern. Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 399 
She became anxious and said that today she had thought of 
her mother for the first time in a long while. She had looked into 
the mirror and had felt for a moment that she was going crazy 
because she had seen her mother. She then went on to tell me 
how her mother had been so sad that she went to see a psychia­
trist shortly before she died, but by then it was too late; how 
nobody had told her that she had cancer. She ended by saying: 
"The poor woman, you know she stole from a shop and the local 
papers were going to report it. It must have been terribly humili­
ating for her." I said: "I think it is very important to you to try 
to hide, from me and from yourself, how ashamed and humili­
ated you feel because it seems as if nobody could want to look 
after your body, and it feels as if you've stolen whatever affection 
you get." 
In response Emma showed genuine emotion almost for the 
first time In the analysis. She said: "I just can't listen to my 
body, I want to ignore it. My mind gets in the way, I can't bear to 
hear what it is saying to me. It's just no use for anything, it's 
worthless." I said: "I think you feel terrified by how much you 
need me to listen to you and talk to you. You would prefer to kill 
that part of yourself that needs to be liked and loved." 
Emma said that it hurt terribly when her senses were awake, 
particularly her sense of smell, which she could experience when 
she was not acidotic. Understanding in analysis was like taking 
insulin. Getting nearer to being better made her feel how hope­
less everything was. I responded: "If you come back to life, you 
feel my reason for caring for you will be gone. If you are near 
death, I think you also feel you are near to me and somehow 
close to your mother." 
Toward the end of this session she revealed an important 
memory about her mother's double incontinence before her 
death and the shame and humiliation she had felt on her moth­
er's behalf. She also remembered hating to go into the room to 
see her because of the smell. At the very end of the session she 
surprised me with her reflectiveness; she said: "I suppose now 
I make myself smell because I am frightened you don't want to 
see me."

ing to her medical regimen induced anxiety and terror because it 
brought her in contact with her desperate infantile need to be 
loved and understood by a frequently psychotic mother. To cope 
with the terror, the separate existence of the mother was denied, 
foreclosing the opportunity for her achievement of full mentaliza­
tion. Yet retaining only primitive modes of experience of psychic 
reality brought with it actual grave physical danger. Experience, 
particularly traumatic experience, could be lived but not thought 
about. 
The need to keep the object close through provocation and 
aggression recreated in the transference the guilt and helpless­
ness that Emma must have felt about her intermittently crazy 
and dying mother. She needed to know whether I was able to 
remain close to her despite her furious attacks upon herself and 
upon me when I became the vehicle of the mad other within the 
self. Equally, in,her attacks on her own body Emma was her 
suicidal mother experienced within the self. In her symptoms, 
she was the destroyer of her remote and mentally inaccessible 
mother's body, as well as the victim of its destruction. 
Emma felt that she could be safe only as long as she made 
sure that she kept a small part of her mind clear, separate from 
her dangerous and chaotic feelings and ideas. Her active self-
representation was separate, physically distant from the source 
of danger, the alien other externalized into her body. The affec-
tional tie to the mother, which could not be mentally represented 
(and therefore felt), could only be recreated in enactment. 
Her interactions with her chaotic and crazy parents resulted 
in heavily invested but confusing internalizations, which she 
could not easily integrate. Consequently she tried to disavow 
these aspects of self-structure and presented herself to herself 
as vulnerable but free of confusion. Because of the fragmented 
nature of her self-representations, she could only interact with 
the object in superficial and inconsequential ways. The repudi­
ated aspects of herself, which derived from the introjections of 
mad family members into the self, expressed themselves in her 
crazy ill-treatment of her body and in fantasies of her destructive 
influence on others, particularly the analyst in the transference.

self-representation. Her partial representation of herself implied 
that, experientially at least, what was happening to her body was 
happening to that disavowed part of herself in which was located 
her experience of confusion and senseless ill-treatment that only 
gained mental representation outside the subjective domain of 
her mind. It gradually emerged that her resistance against analy­
sis contained within it her terror that in letting down the barriers 
to her haven she would be confronted by the mad and unpredict­
able reactions of her objects. Notwithstanding her symptomatic 
misuse of her body, Emma's irresolvable problem was that her 
internalizations of her mad objects were inseparably interwoven 
with mental representations that constituted her sense of her 
own mental existence. 
The intensity of the psychoanalytic encounter gave Emma the 
opportunity to extend her self-representation on the basis of 
differentiated perceptions of the chaotic responses of her objects. 
The process was a long and painstaking one. Its critical compo­
nent was that Emma gradually became able to reintegrate within 
her self-representation the dangerous images from which she 
sought refuge in the pain of keto-acidosis. To give up the relative 
safety of her encapsulated identity, separated from the chaos 
that surrounded it, meant experiencing in the transference a 
terrifying sense of fusion with me as a psychotic object. This 
occurred repeatedly, and sessions such as the one in which the 
Equus dream emerged were but particularly dramatic examples 
of a long-term process that, in our view, was critical in bringing 
about her improvement. 
Emma was not easy to treat, but in six years she made 
substantial gains and was no longer brittle diabetic or self-
harming, although she remains deeply confused about relation­
ships and her own role in them. She is a reasonably successful 
art student and now has a boyfriend who is a competent sculp­
tor and is very encouraging of her work. Emma has finished her 
treatment. Her bingeing and almost delusional disregard for 
insulin have ceased. Her periods of improved control were, for a 
time, still punctuated by episodes of acute self-destructiveness. 
At her discharge from the clinic she was symptom-free, and we 
hope that her treatment will have ultimately been comparatively 
successful.

able reactions of her objects. Notwithstanding her symptomatic 
misuse of her body, Emma's irresolvable problem was that her 
internalizations of her mad objects were inseparably interwoven 
with mental representations that constituted her sense of her 
own mental existence. 
The intensity of the psychoanalytic encounter gave Emma the 
opportunity to extend her self-representation on the basis of 
differentiated perceptions of the chaotic responses of her objects. 
The process was a long and painstaking one. Its critical compo­
nent was that Emma gradually became able to reintegrate within 
her self-representation the dangerous images from which she 
sought refuge in the pain of keto-acidosis. To give up the relative 
safety of her encapsulated identity, separated from the chaos 
that surrounded it, meant experiencing in the transference a 
terrifying sense of fusion with me as a psychotic object. This 
occurred repeatedly, and sessions such as the one in which the 
Equus dream emerged were but particularly dramatic examples 
of a long-term process that, in our view, was critical in bringing 
about her improvement. 
Emma was not easy to treat, but in six years she made 
substantial gains and was no longer brittle diabetic or self-
harming, although she remains deeply confused about relation­
ships and her own role in them. She is a reasonably successful 
art student and now has a boyfriend who is a competent sculp­
tor and is very encouraging of her work. Emma has finished her 
treatment. Her bingeing and almost delusional disregard for 
insulin have ceased. Her periods of improved control were, for a 
time, still punctuated by episodes of acute self-destructiveness. 
At her discharge from the clinic she was symptom-free, and we 
hope that her treatment will have ultimately been comparatively 
successful. 

402 / Clinical Perspectives 
Separation and Separateness 
Let us begin by considering the dysfunction in Emma's psychic 
reality and its implications for key aspects of her psychopathol-
ogy: her dependency, her self-harming, and her reaction to the 
analysis. 
Emma's major difficulty was at the level of metarepresenta-
tions (see chapter 4). Emma, like other borderline patients, had 
only partial pictures of her own mental experience (her represen­
tational world). The mental processes that underpin psychic 
reality were dysfunctional as a consequence of early trauma. She 
therefore had no clear vision of herself; she experienced herself 
as an empty shell into which insulin was injected, as a vehicle 
stuck in outer space, remote from the "terra firma" of her pri­
mary representations, and consequently she had little control 
over her feelings and thoughts, and her identity rapidly shifted 
between any incompatible images. An essential source of psychic 
organization—reflective capacity—was absent. 
A striking aspect of the analyst's relationship with Emma was 
her clear dependency on him as a physical presence. Her attend­
ance was remarkable, particularly within a lifestyle totally lack­
ing in self-discipline. It is tempting to understand this as an 
indication of a bond or at least as part of an idealized identifica-
tory process. We believe that her dependence may have been 
more primitive than these possibilities suggest. Emma required 
the continued physical presence of the other principally not for 
her protection (Bowlby 1988) but because, without an external 
mirror, she was incapable of becoming aware of herself as some­
thing more than a physical being, as a thinker, as a container of 
feelings and desires, as an intentional -human being. Our core 
sense of self depends on the coherence and clarity with which we 
were able to perceive ourselves as intentional beings in the 
minds of attachment figures. Emma's incoherent sense of herself 
required the continued physical presence of another in whose 
voice, face, and behavior she could identify herself as a person. 
As the analyst disappeared at the end of the session or at the 
time of a break, she no longer had access to this image. She felt 
literally lost in the ferment of her feelings and ideas over which 
she had such poor control. Her capacity to mentalize was tenu-Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 403 
ous, and in the analyst's absence she felt abandoned to an 
experience of her mental world, which felt mad and overwhelm­
ing. Again and again the analyst's simple mentalization of her 
feelings visibly calmed her. In this context her need was not for 
the recapitulation of a failed developmental experience (Kohut 
1984) but, rather, a solution to a current problem—the address­
ing of a deviant developmental process. Emma's need was not for 
the provision of a general holding environment (Winnicott 1962) 
but for the creation of an interpersonal situation where her 
potential for reflective function could be specifically and safely-
exercised. 
As Edith Jacobson (1964) noted, the internalization of the 
representation of another before the boundaries of the self are 
fully formed undermines the creation of a coherent sense of self 
because the infant is forced to internalize the other as a core 
part of his self. Now, not only is the creation of an integrated 
psychic reality compromised because of the weakness of the core 
self, but the individual has to contend with an alien being lodged 
within the self-structure: the thoughts and feelings associated 
with the introjected mother rather than the experiences of the 
child himself feel real. 
The suggestion here is that the child, experiencing the inter­
nal world in the mode of psychic equivalence, frequently solves 
this problem by externalizing these alien aspects of the self-
representation back onto the real object. While this may lead to 
great conflict or ambivalence in the external relationship (oppo­
sitional behavior, aggression to protect the self from the object, 
etc.), it works in that the individual can experience himself in a 
more authentic way, as long as there are other parts of the self-
representation that are not seriously distorted and can be drawn 
on to create a coherent if impoverished inner world. 
This may be a relatively stable structure throughout child­
hood, or as long as the physical presence of the object can be 
ensured. This was the case for Emma, whose psychological 
problems were clearly linked with the physical loss of the mater­
nal object. The onset of her symptoms might be understood as 
having been triggered by the loss of an ambivalent relationship 
(Freud 1917e [1915]). We believe that the analytic material sug­
gests that the crisis for Emma was a result of the loss of

could be externalized. This becomes a critical problem for adoles­
cents with this form of disorganization of the self—an issue that 
was addressed in detail in chapter 8. 
The Use of the Body as a Channel 
for Unprocessed Mental States 
The absence of an object that could contain her feelings forced 
Emma to create interpersonal' experiences with physical objects 
rather than with people. Even more important, there was a 
constant pressure for the currency of the relationship between 
analyst and analysand, as between the primary caregiver and 
the infant, to become physical—the real thing, as opposed to a 
thought, a feeling, or an idea. Emma would communicate anxi­
ety by becoming ketotic. Her bodily states of "highs" and "lows" 
conveyed her mood far better than did her verbalizations. This is 
a manifestation of a mind functioning within a psychic equiva­
lence mode, in the absence of mentalization. Thus, she enacted 
with her body in the session, created real anxiety, real anger, 
and real confusion, rather than being able to describe these as 
current internal states. The focus of her disturbance on her body 
is characteristic of these patients, as this indeed is the only part 
of the internal world that they can feel in control of. Many of 
the feelings and ideas that Emma was unable to represent as 
thoughts and feelings were experienced in relation to her body. 
Her awareness of there being something wrong with her as well 
as her efforts at self-improvement were focused on the body, 
which, she felt, achieved a degree of lethal perfection. She was 
able to maintain her diabetes at the edge of ketotic coma and, at 
the same time, maintain her weight within the range she consid­
ered ideal. 
Clinical experience provides ample evidence for the often 
deeply distorted attitudes of borderline patients to their bodies. Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 405 
Why should developmental failures in the psychological self have 
a significant impact on physical identity and adjustment? 
1. When psychic reality is poorly integrated, the body takes on 
an excessively central role for the continuity of the sense of self. 
This may become critical in adolescence, when changes in body 
shape and function signify a far greater change in identity for 
these individuals than for those whose psychological self-repre­
sentation is developmentally more advanced. Some adolescents 
(such as early-onset anorexics) experience existential anxieties 
in relation to puberty: as if they have ceased to exist—have 
become different people. There is psychic equivalence between 
the experience of body shape and its concrete parameters; to be 
thinner is felt to be superior and is therefore superior. 
2. The persistence of psychic equivalence contributes to spe­
cific physical states acquiring exaggerated significance in rela­
tion to the self. Mental states, unable to achieve representation 
as ideas or feelings, come to be represented in the bodily domain. 
Physical attributes such as weight come to reflect states such as 
internal well-being, control, sense of self-worth, and so on, far 
beyond the normal tendency for this to happen in adolescence. 
For Emma, getting thinner could make her feel not just better 
about herself but a different person. Serious eating disorders 
show us how concretely the body shape can be felt to represent 
aspects of personality. Emma looked at her body, and her per­
ception was distorted not because she looked fat, but because 
she felt that there were unacceptable things inside her that 
could be controlled, by manipulating her diet and insulin, or 
even got rid of (from the mind via the body) by inducing hyper­
glycemic states of confusion or coma. 
3. A further complication is that not only were Emma's own 
states of mind and self-experience experienced as externalized 
into the body, but so also was the alien part of her self-represen­
tation. This gave a further reason for punishing it. For Emma, 
this alien object was the psychotic part of her mother. She 
looked into the mirror and saw her mother. The destructive

states of mind and self-experience experienced as externalized 
into the body, but so also was the alien part of her self-represen­

this alien object was the psychotic part of her mother. She 
looked into the mirror and saw her mother. The destructive 

406 / Clinical Perspectives 
attack on the other experienced as in one's own body perhaps 
gives an additional feeling of well-being and integrity of the self, 
which can be seen in some of these abnormal states, such 
as self-cutting or starvation. Hurting the body helps, we would 
suggest, by leaving the mind feeling more coherent and bound­
ed, belonging more clearly to the self while the body is sacrificed. 
The object cannot be genuinely attacked mentally because it 
resides within the mental self. The body, however, because of its 
separateness from the self-representation, can be readily con­
verted into a vehicle for the introjected other part of the self. 
We are suggesting that self-harm, in particular, can be used 
to create a sense of reflection that would normally be intrapsy­
chic but has to be established for some people through external 
relationships or through visible attacks on their bodies. Not 
having a clear sense of themselves from within, they need to find 
a sense of the self through getting other people, to react to them, 
and through treating themselves as objects, literally rather than 
metaphorically, because the self is experienced as a physical 
being without psychological meaning. 
Implications for the Analytic Process 
What may be crucial here is the sense of psychic equivalence in 
the relationship between a state of mind and a physical reality. 
In this sense, it is wrong to think of a representational process 
mediating these forms of pathology: the body is not symbolic of a 
state of mind in the mother; it is at that moment experienced as 
equivalent to the mother's state of mind and is reacted to accord­
ingly. The interpretation of the symbolic meaning of the state of 
the body for the individual has been found, in our work with 
brittle diabetics, rarely to be effective (Fonagy, Moran, and Target 
1993b; Moran 1984). It is the split-off part of the self (the alien 
object) that interpretive work may assist in restoring to and then 
distinguishing from the self-representation. As in the analysis 
of Emma, this will often mean that the alien other comes to 
be experienced in the transference: the analyst becomes the 
mad mother with the damaged eye. Once the analyst, through 
mentalizing this experience repeatedly, has helped Emma to i Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 407 
understand that this mad mother is actually part of herself, she 
could at the same time own and distance herself from it. She 
came to be able to resist damaging her own eyesight in the 
service of this externalization. Only after this disentangling had 
been achieved could the complexity of mental states, such as 
conflicts and defenses, begin to be considered therapeutically. 
Unfortunately, balancing the therapeutic effect of the rela­
tionship with the analyst was also a countertherapeutic ten­
dency inherent to such analytic relationships. Whereas with 
many patients it is possible to interpret the pressure toward 
role-responsiveness, patients such as Emma are invested in the 
externalization in a much more malignant way. They are not just 
trying to push the analyst into representing part of themselves 
but (because of the predominance of psychic equivalence) to be 
the disavowed part of the self-representation. If the analyst were 
to reject the function of Emma's psychotic mother, about whom 
she could feel concern, that would have left her with having to 
contain it within herself, which she could only do by externaliz­
ing it into her body. On the other hand, if he did accept the role 
of the mad doctor, as she said, how could he possibly help her? 
The physical other who performs this function must remain 
present for this complex process to operate. Emma could not feel 
that she was herself unless she had her analyst there to intimi­
date and reduce to helplessness. His departure would signal the 
return of those "exterojects" and the destruction of the coher­
ence she achieved by projection. The analyst was thus faced with 
a seemingly impossible challenge. For the relationship to serve a 
function and to be tolerable, the analyst has to become what the 
patient wishes him to be. To be an analyst and help the patient 
overcome such primitive modes of relating, the analyst must be 
anything but what is projected onto him. Unless he is able to 
adopt an attitude analogous to that of the parent engaged in 
pretend play with a child, constantly juggling responses to these 
opposing pressures, the analysis is doomed to become a rigid 
stereotypic repetition of pathological exchanges. 
There are further complications in working with patients 
whose psychic reality remains at an archaic level, predominantly 
of psychic equivalence. Emma's observation of her analyst's 
injury led her to reexperience, rather than to remember, the real

of psychic equivalence. Emma's observation of her analyst's 
injury led her to reexperience, rather than to remember, the real 

^^r 
408 / Clinical Perspectives 
violence of her childhood. At moments when she could experi­
ence the mad part of herself as in her body, Emma succeeded in 
achieving a calm detachment that totally precluded the need for 
analysis, while (at a physical level) a fierce battle raged for her 
life. She needed the contact with the analyst for the reasons that 
we have mentioned, but she genuinely saw no reason for her to 
be analyzed. Her attitudes were understandable in terms of the 
belief that wanting to be a particular type of person made it true 
for others and true for herself as well. This clearly involved a 
split way of experiencing internal reality. There was an imperfect 
integration between the child's-two modes of representing ideas 
and feelings. 
Implications for Technique 
The focus of technique in such cases is thus no longer on 
making conscious what had been unconscious. Emma improved 
symptomatically, in terms of her diabetes, her depressions, and 
her relationships, but it would be even more inappropriate for 
the analyst to be focusing on changing these symptoms with a 
borderline individual than it is with neurotic patients. We believe 
that the appropriate technical priority is the analyst's survival, 
with a coherent identity, or, more specifically, the preservation of 
a clear picture of the patient's mental state in the analyst's 
mind. The analyst's survival ensured that Emma did not succeed 
in destroying the perception of herself as a person. He needed to 
hold on to a sense of himself and of her experience, so that she 
could slowly discover this apperception of herself in his mind, to 
gain a foothold for her own representation of her thoughts and 
feelings. 
A major hurdle can lie in overcoming the countertransference 
resistance to a full recognition of the depth of the patient's 
disturbance. The source of the.resistance is partly narcissistic— 
a reluctance to see oneself as one is being seen. Allowing the real 
possibility of being psychotic, relinquishing the need to assert 
one's sanity as a way of reassuring oneself, or interpreting the 
patient's need to take over and totally possess as an aggressive 
attack, all serve to give patients space to think for themselves, Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 409 
but naturally at the expense of the analyst's capacity to do so. 
Analytic capacity is called for not in deciphering unconscious 
motivation, but in being able to reflect on one's own very uncom­
fortable experience sufficiently to be able to resist the pull of this 
psychic equivalence mode, to retain a mentalizing stance. 
Clinicians may confront the discrepancy between their per­
ception of themselves and that of the patient (Kernberg 1995). 
The patient's rigid commitment to a false belief might prompt 
one to say: "Either I am mad or a liar, or you are mistaken." We 
feel that it is important to appreciate that the status of psychic 
reality for such individuals involves a direct correspondence 
between their beliefs and reality. The possibility of false belief or 
doubt is inaccessible. Only one version of reality can be true; the 
possibility of viable alternatives implies terrifying and deeply 
resisted mentalization and must be obliterated. 
In normal child development, it is prototypically through en­
gaging playfully with an adult simultaneously entertaining two 
realities that the child becomes able to adopt the parent's per­
spective on the play (see also Emde, Kubicek, and Oppenheim 
1997). Ultimately, this allows the child to integrate the psychic 
equivalence and pretend modes of representing psychic reality 
and, having made this step, to develop a reflective mentalizing 
capacity. The analyst's stance toward the patient is not a playful 
one; we think that this would be an inappropriate extension of 
the developmental metaphor. However, there is an analogy with 
play. What we believe the analyst needs to try to do is to provide 
an alternative perspective on the patient's state of mind while all 
the time supporting her in retaining her sense of her own experi­
ence, a way of presenting the same yet not the same. This is the 
idea that underpins Winnicott's notion of object presentation 
(Winnicott 1960). This is a functional, but not a developmental, 
equivalent of an absence of environmental impingement, in Win-1 
nicott's sense. 
A patient at the opposite end of the dichotomy of externally

violence of her childhood. At moments when she could experi­
ence the mad part of herself as in her body, Emma succeeded in 
achieving a calm detachment that totally precluded the need for 
analysis, while (at a physical level) a fierce battle raged for her 
life. She needed the contact with the analyst for the reasons that 
we have mentioned, but she genuinely saw no reason for her to 
be analyzed. Her attitudes were understandable in terms of the 
belief that wanting to be a particular type of person made it true 
for others and true for herself as well. This clearly involved a 
split way of experiencing internal reality. There was an imperfect 
integration between the child's-two modes of representing ideas 
and feelings. 
Implications for Technique 
The focus of technique in such cases is thus no longer on 
making conscious what had been unconscious. Emma improved 
symptomatically, in terms of her diabetes, her depressions, and 
her relationships, but it would be even more inappropriate for 
the analyst to be focusing on changing these symptoms with a 
borderline individual than it is with neurotic patients. We believe 
that the appropriate technical priority is the analyst's survival, 
with a coherent identity, or, more specifically, the preservation of 
a clear picture of the patient's mental state in the analyst's 
mind. The analyst's survival ensured that Emma did not succeed 
in destroying the perception of herself as a person. He needed to 
hold on to a sense of himself and of her experience, so that she 
could slowly discover this apperception of herself in his mind, to 
gain a foothold for her own representation of her thoughts and 
feelings. 
A major hurdle can lie in overcoming the countertransference 
resistance to a full recognition of the depth of the patient's 
disturbance. The source of the.resistance is partly narcissistic— 
a reluctance to see oneself as one is being seen. Allowing the real 
possibility of being psychotic, relinquishing the need to assert 
one's sanity as a way of reassuring oneself, or interpreting the 
patient's need to take over and totally possess as an aggressive 
attack, all serve to give patients space to think for themselves, Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 409 
but naturally at the expense of the analyst's capacity to do so. 
Analytic capacity is called for not in deciphering unconscious 
motivation, but in being able to reflect on one's own very uncom­
fortable experience sufficiently to be able to resist the pull of this 
psychic equivalence mode, to retain a mentalizing stance. 
Clinicians may confront the discrepancy between their per­
ception of themselves and that of the patient (Kernberg 1995). 
The patient's rigid commitment to a false belief might prompt 
one to say: "Either I am mad or a liar, or you are mistaken." We 
feel that it is important to appreciate that the status of psychic 
reality for such individuals involves a direct correspondence 
between their beliefs and reality. The possibility of false belief or 
doubt is inaccessible. Only one version of reality can be true; the 
possibility of viable alternatives implies terrifying and deeply 
resisted mentalization and must be obliterated. 
In normal child development, it is prototypically through en­
gaging playfully with an adult simultaneously entertaining two 
realities that the child becomes able to adopt the parent's per­
spective on the play (see also Emde, Kubicek, and Oppenheim 
1997). Ultimately, this allows the child to integrate the psychic 
equivalence and pretend modes of representing psychic reality 
and, having made this step, to develop a reflective mentalizing 
capacity. The analyst's stance toward the patient is not a playful 
one; we think that this would be an inappropriate extension of 
the developmental metaphor. However, there is an analogy with 
play. What we believe the analyst needs to try to do is to provide 
an alternative perspective on the patient's state of mind while all 
the time supporting her in retaining her sense of her own experi­
ence, a way of presenting the same yet not the same. This is the

said, "I'll show you what pain is, you little shit!" Without think­
ing, the analyst said, "You know, as I get older I can't see things 
so clearly when they are too close to my eyes," and with that he 
gently moved the clenched fist away from his face. To the ana­
lyst's relief and surprise, the patient immediately calmed down 
and smiled. On reflection, it seems clear what might have been 
critical in this exchange: the analyst's awareness of the patient's 
pain, while accurate, reached the patient in a mode of psychic 
equivalence, making his distress frighteningly real. The same 
interpretation to Emma might have reached her in pretend mode 
and led to immediate acceptance and meaningless integration 
with her false self-representation. The analyst's intuitive playful 
response forced this patient to experience the world through his 
somewhat long-sighted perspective and thus to see him as a real 
person, allowing the patient to enter his mental world. Let us 
examine at greater length another female case whose problems 
with dysfunctional psychic reality found expression in signifi­
cant externalizing as well as internalizing behavior problems. 
DYSFUNCTIONAL PSYCHIC REALITY 
IN INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE: 
"HENRIETTA" 
Henrietta3 was in her mid-thirties when she referred herself to 
a forensic psychiatrist colleague for counseling. Strangely, the 
referral on to me mentioned nothing about a forensic history but 
described repeated suicide attempts, unstable but intense rela­
tionships, and abuse of her medication. The referral did not 
prepare me, however, for the paranoid, almost psychotic, but in 
fact dissociated episodes with hallucinations and some thought 
disorder that were to be so striking in my work with her. 
Two facts make Henrietta's history unusual from a psycho­
analytic standpoint. The first is that she was a murderer—not of 
her internal objects, her self-representation, her thinking and

feeling or other parts of her and her object's mind, although she 
was undoubtedly guilty of all these, but of her boyfriend. She 
had stabbed him in the course of a violent quarrel. She pleaded 
self-defense and that the stabbing was accidental. She was 
charged with manslaughter and was freed with a suspended 
sentence. About four years into the analysis she confessed to me 
that the stabbing had not, in fact, been an accident. While not 
premeditated, it had certainly been intentional. She had felt 
driven by violent, blinding rage. By that time, four years into the 
analysis, I was familiar with Henrietta's vicious, explosive at­
tacks of rage. I was not really surprised by her revelation. 
The second fact was her experience of abuse. She described 
having first been sexually abused by her alcoholic father, then as 
a teenager by a teacher in her boarding school. Both experiences 
included intercourse. Her father also beat Henrietta for various 
misdemeanors at least once a week and more severely, usually 
for "answering back," at least once a month. The abuse by her 
father remained a secret between them until his death shortly 
before the start of her treatment. The relationship with the 
teacher became public, and the man concerned was dismissed. 
Why would someone like Henrietta come into analysis? She 
seemed never to have had an understanding relationship. She 
said she wanted to get help with the terrifying dreams that had 
started with the death of her father. She came to the first 
interview in a strident mood, demanding a brief period of coun­
seling. She did not know that I was a psychoanalyst, and, on 
noticing the couch some time into the interview, she said, "So, 
this is where you fuck your patients?" A feeling of fear washed 
over me. Rather than reacting directly to her combative intrusive 
manner, I was aware of the vulnerability and enormous anxiety 
behind her need to strike out and hurt. I said, aiming to be 
reassuring, "You must feel quite brave that you dared to come 
and see me." She said, continuing her contemptuous tone, "You 
shrinks are abusers. It's just a power trip." I said, now more 
confident of my counter-transference response, "I think it is your 
own power to destroy and abuse that frightens you about ther­
apy. You feel much more confident about being able to cope 
with me." She stopped short and asked me what I meant by 
"therapy."

412 / Clinical Perspectives 
She started once a week, but over eighteen months built up to 
four times a week. She would have come five times, hut her work 
was no longer in London. She missed almost no sessions. Her 
commitment to the analytic process was humbling and strength­
ened my belief in the pervasiveness of the wish to be heard and 
recognized. However, what happened between Henrietta and 
myself might not generally be regarded as analysis. My interven­
tions were rarely experienced as interpretations. I am certain 
that she had little sense of insight, at least during the early 
years. Let us illustrate what happened at that time. 
She arrived on time to the session, sat in a chair, and 
said she felt upset, and she looked at me challengingly without 
speaking further. I said, "I don't understand. You need to tell me 
what upset is for you at the moment." She said that she had had 
another dream about her father, which had upset her. In the 
dream, he had asked her to put her head up his backside and she 
did not want to do it. She was ready to follow through with a 
string of obscene images depicting .the sexual life between her 
father and herself. I interrupted: "I think you are upset.because 
you are frightened that I will make you bury your head in messy 
thoughts here." She stopped in her tracks, told me in a rapid 
sequence I could hardly follow that she was lost, that her mother 
didn't understand, she wasn't trying to hurt anybody, that the 
death was an accident, that she tried to resuscitate him, to give 
him the kiss of life, but failed, and now I was trying to kill her. 
There was a gradual acceleration of tempo and intensification of 
affect. By the end I was in the room with an apparently angry yet 
basically terrified person. It was unclear what these feelings 
were about. She seemed terrified by violence—her own or mine. 
She expected to be killed by a raging jealous object or to kill an 
invading, threatening one. I said, trying to calm her by stepping 
outside the fray: "It seems that you feel driven by a terror that 
you might lose me in this violence. You feel you constantly have 
to resuscitate me, to breathe life into me just to keep me alive for 
yourself." She was silent. Eventually she responded, somewhat 
more calmly, that she was frightened of being a person. She 
preferred being empty; people only attacked you if they knew you 
were somebody. I said, "I agree. I think you feel safer with me 
when you feel empty. It feels even safer if you feel you have 
it Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 413 
emptied me too." Her terror that I might kill her and the even 
greater fear that she might kill me, intentionally or accidentally, 
overrode all other concerns. 
This brief vignette raises several issues. The analyst did not 
presume to know what "upset" meant for Henrietta at this time. 
Most patients would have been aware that the analyst was not 
going to know what was upsetting them, but for a patient work­
ing in psychic equivalence mode, the analyst already knows 
what she knows (perhaps better than she does) and does not 
need to be told. After the intervention, Henrietta immediately 
shifted into a kind of pretend mode when she started to talk 
about the dream images. Unlike the situation with a neurotic 
patient, for whom the exploration of a sexual fantasy might be 
very therapeutic, for a patient like Henrietta it seemed vital to 
interrupt this retreat into something that was represented as 
unreal. The analyst's task was then to find something that was 
felt to be real, though obscure, within that image. The analyst 
therefore focused on the anxiety about the confusion with which 
having to talk about her thoughts and feelings evidently con­
fronted her. That in itself provoked more anxiety than it con­
tained. Suddenly, the fantasies became real: she shifted into a 
psychic equivalence mode and seemed almost to feel that her life 
was in danger. This panic escalated until somebody else con­
tained it. Somebody was going to get killed. The aim of this sort 
of cathartic outburst is not mainly, we suggest, a wish to be 
contained or to work through an experience but, rather, an 
emptying of the self which quite consciously feels like preempt­
ing an imminent attack. The countertransference response is 
often a sense of emptiness, which is seen as the result of an 
attempt to relieve anxiety by reducing both people to an equally 
unthinking state, rather than a primarily destructive attack on 
the analyst's thinking. 
Psychoanalysts often write about the concreteness of thought, 
broadly building on Freud's distinction between word and thing 
representations. Mostly, these concern concreteness of meaning, 
whereas with Henrietta it was the reality of the thought pro­
cesses themselves that created such an obstacle. For Henrietta, 
her thoughts sometimes did not feel owned by her mind but 
were, rather, experienced as if spoken and thus made externally

real. We see this as one possible consequence of equating inner 
experience with outer reality. 
It took me some time to realize that in these conversations 
there was often a third presence. There was a voice inside her 
head—someone who, she felt, was she, but not she at the same 
time, an alien aspect of her often dissociated state. Her thoughts 
seemed to possess an immediacy that was difficult to appreciate 
fully. Fleeting ideas or images were experienced as disembodied 
voices, sometimes friendly but mostly persecutory and vicious. 
While clearly not hallucinations, her thoughts were also not felt 
to be coming from her own mind. Her "associations" at these 
times were responses to what she "heard" as much as a dialogue 
with me. This posed an interesting challenge for my work in the 
transference. Eventually, I began to address this voice more 
directly. 
In one session Henrietta came in confused, obviously more 
than usually so. She sat down on the couch and looked at me 
quizzically, as if asking, "What is going to happen next?" I said, 
equally puzzled: "You don't know what to say to me, and I don't 
know what to say to you." This prompted her to launch into a 
long and puzzling narrative about dancers who "gave their blood" 
in training and practice, went to endless auditions, but found no 
work. She said she was upset about the injustice of it all. But 
then, as though she were responding to someone else—almost as 
if she were aware of the transference meaning of what she had 
been saying—she said in quite a different voice, "You are going to 
have to stop this treatment, aren't you?" Thinking of the con­
crete reality of her internal experience and wanting to acknowl­
edge how completely compelling it felt to her, I said, "I think that 
you are being told that I will reject you, no matter how hard you 
try here. You want me to understand your distress but you are 
not being allowed to tell me about it. It all feels so real that you 
must feel terribly confused." She buried her head in the pillow 
and started to sob violently: "I am so confused. I feel so bad. I am 
told I am fine, but I feel hopeless. Please tell me what is wrong 
with me." I replied with the intention to enter into her mental 
world, but at the same time to insert the analyst's voice as 
another perspective that could eventually become therapeutic: 
"You feel that because I ask you to come here for only 50 Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 415 
minutes on a particular day, I can't possibly understand what 
your needs really are. I think you have a voice inside your head 
telling you 'you are fine.' And it sometimes sounds like my voice." 
She calmed down a bit, and then she seemed to suffer something 
like an allergic response to contact with the analyst. She sud­
denly said, as if unaware of the contradictions, "I don't need 
help. I am fine. I am sick. I want to throw up." Then a pause. "I 
want to throw up when people get-too close. You get taken over. 
You must understand me. You don't understand me. Do you 
understand me?" I said, trying to identify the source of anxiety, 
"You are terrified of what I do understand. It must be so sicken­
ing that I have to throw you out." She said, still sobbing, "It's the 
sex. It's so wrong. I am so frightened you might misunderstand. I 
am trying so hard to make something happen this time." I said, 
regarding the reference to sex as defensive, aiming to distract us 
from the immediate source of her anxiety: "You hope for some­
thing good to happen here, but you are also frightened because 
you hear a voice telling you to spoil it by confusing and misleadT 
ing me." 
There are many analytic understandings to explain what was 
happening between us: the wish to create a perverted analytic 
intercourse filled with sexual excitement, which hid her guilt 
and vulnerability; the wish to make me into a pathetic dancer to 
her tune and observe me "giving my blood" in a futile attempt to 
save her; the regressive infantile omnipotence of the triumph of 
chaos over understanding; the self, defensively split between a 
pleading vulnerable identity and an omnipotent, invulnerable 
dictator; and so on. All these and more were true. The addi­
tional understanding that I had to hold on to over these early 
years was somewhat different. Alongside her craving for any­
thing that might give a sense of order to her psychic chaos, she 
desperately fought the truth of any idea, not for its specific 
contents, but because of the intolerable sickness engendered by 
the closeness of two human minds. There was something that 
felt sickening and disgusting about genuine feelings and ideas; 
there was an abhorrence of communication and reflection. She 
had tried to repudiate her capacity to conceive of mental states, 
in herself and in me, leaving her with rigid, schematic represen­
tations.

help. I am fine. I am sick. I want to throw up." Then a pause. "I 
want to throw up when people get-too close. You get taken over. 
You must understand me. You don't understand me. Do you 
understand me?" I said, trying to identify the source of anxiety, 
"You are terrified of what I do understand. It must be so sicken­
ing that I have to throw you out." She said, still sobbing, "It's the 
sex. It's so wrong. I am so frightened you might misunderstand. I 
am trying so hard to make something happen this time." I said, 
regarding the reference to sex as defensive, aiming to distract us 
from the immediate source of her anxiety: "You hope for some­
thing good to happen here, but you are also frightened because 
you hear a voice telling you to spoil it by confusing and misleadT 
ing me." 
There are many analytic understandings to explain what was 
happening between us: the wish to create a perverted analytic 
intercourse filled with sexual excitement, which hid her guilt 
and vulnerability; the wish to make me into a pathetic dancer to 
her tune and observe me "giving my blood" in a futile attempt to 
save her; the regressive infantile omnipotence of the triumph of 
chaos over understanding; the self, defensively split between a 
pleading vulnerable identity and an omnipotent, invulnerable 
dictator; and so on. All these and more were true. The addi­
tional understanding that I had to hold on to over these early 
years was somewhat different. Alongside her craving for any­
thing that might give a sense of order to her psychic chaos, she 
desperately fought the truth of any idea, not for its specific 
contents, but because of the intolerable sickness engendered by 
the closeness of two human minds. There was something that 
felt sickening and disgusting about genuine feelings and ideas; 
there was an abhorrence of communication and reflection. She 
had tried to repudiate her capacity to conceive of mental states, 
in herself and in me, leaving her with rigid, schematic represen­
tations. 

416 / Clinical Perspectives 
Analysis was an obscene seduction because thinking about 
mental states was an incestuous act, experienced as the intru­
sion of an object into a space far too small to contain it. Her 
adaptation to trauma entailed the disavowal of feelings and 
intentions, in herself and in all others close to her. The primary 
thoroughfare for sharing psychic reality—symbolic thought— 
was blocked. Instead, the thoughts were experienced as literally, 
externally real and unchangeable, thinking was felt as words 
that have been spoken and cannot be taken back. Talking of 
thoughts as though they were voices was a way of depicting the 
sense that they were perceived rather than conceived by her. The 
transference could not be referred to as an "as-if experience; at 
this stage perhaps the analyst needs to work partly within the 
frame of reference of psychic equivalence, notwithstanding the 
immense countertransference resistance against entering that 
frame of reference with somebody whose thoughts were terrify-
ingly violent and confused. It was the analyst's task to make the 
capacity for the representation of her internal states safe. This is 
what a parent needs to be able to do with a small child, but to 
identify with the perspective of a violent, uncontrolled adult is 
far rnore threatening and disturbing than doing the same with a 
child, even a child with similar feelings. 
Ideally, the parent accepts the child's experience when the 
child is in a mode of psychic equivalence, but at the same time 
behaves in a way that implies that the parent does not have the 
same experience. A small child may be too frightened to sleep 
because the dressing gown hanging behind the door seems to be 
a man waiting to jump out. This is real to the child at those 
times, and the feeling of terror is correspondingly compelling. 
The parent does not simply tell the child that the dressing gown 
is not a man, or that it is silly to be frightened, but removes the 
dressing gown in a way that recognizes the reality of the fright­
ening idea, ;but without showing fear.4 Thus, the parent both

communication of the simultaneous acknowledgment of psychic reality and an 
alternative perspective signaling safety. Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 417 
enters into and provides the possibility of distance from the 
child's perception, introducing a different perspective. This is 
parallel to the introduction of alternative perspectives through 
playing and pretending with the child, but this time in a serious 
frame of mind. This is what the analyst is engaged in with 
borderline patients. Henrietta's analyst respected the reality of 
her terror of closeness, but in doing so also introduced the idea 
that the terror was based on belief rather than fact. No technical 
innovation is implied here. This is the very ordinary thing that 
analysts do, particularly when working in the transference. Indi­
viduals with borderline pathology have such a powerful predis­
position to distortion that the analyst cannot assume that the 
mere act of interpretation will convey this idea without specifi­
cally and repeatedly addressing alternative perspectives. 
In the sessions with Henrietta, the affect was intense. The 
terror and the distress were real: a desperate hunger for under­
standing was only matched by her desire to empty her mind. 
The countertransference was brimming with discomfort and 
confusion. She acted dangerously, regularly threatened to kill 
herself, and got into violent quarrels with both friends and 
strangers for which I was made to feel culpable. She frightened 
me with the threat of litigation for negligence and gave me a 
letter of complaint that she drafted for my professional associa­
tion, where my "incompetence" was carefully documented: any 
change of appointment, cancellation, lateness, confusion about 
times, misremembering of names—all were listed and dated. I 
was criticized for speaking and then ridiculed for my silences. At 
other times I was made to feel her savior. The fluidity of her 
psychic reality meant that much of the time I could not know 
what I was doing, beyond the basic effort to appreciate what her 
psychic equivalence exposed me to, and then to attempt to 
communicate that awareness to her. 
The kind of dramatic splitting reflected in Henrietta's under­
standing of her analyst's intentions is, of course, a hallmark 
of the paranoid-schizoid position in general, and of borderline 
states in particular. Elsewhere (Fonagy, Target, and Gergely 
2000) we have speculated, following Gergely (2000), that the 
mechanism of splitting is a developmental by-product of the

infant's need to create a coherent image of the mental state of 
the other, which in the immature mind generates coherent but 
limited subsets of intentional states, primarily an idealized and a 
persecutory identity. 
My ability to orientate to Henrietta's psychic reality was fur­
ther reduced by what I came to refer to as the "gaps" in the 
analytic dialogue. There were periods of minutes where my sense 
of there being any meaning simply disappeared. Usually, these 
occurred in periods of silence. In contrast to patients whose 
silence implies thoughtfulness, or others for whom it indicates 
withholding or resistance, or yet others whose silence is a com­
munication in the transference, Henrietta's silences communi­
cated nothing. On the first few occasions, I blundered into the 
silences and tried to attribute meaning to them: "My words 
frightened you, and you feel you need to cut me out," or "You feel 
rejected, so you are now rejecting me." Mostly, these suggestions 
would get no response, and when this occasionally was not the 
case, Henrietta responded as if I had woken her from a state of 
reverie: "What did you just say?" I gradually noticed that these 
episodes extended beyond the silence. Henrietta would some­
times start to speak with some feeling, but when I made a 
comment, she would he quite unable to respond, sometimes 
even apparently not hearing. For example, on one occasion she 
described her father's funeral with a clarity that almost made me 
feel that I was there. Later, when she mentioned not being able 
to cry, I mentioned that she had cried at the funeral; to my 
surprise, she responded, "What funeral? Don't you remember I 
never went to my father's funeral?" 
These encounters with dissociation in the analytic setting are 
probably not unusual with this group of patients. Henrietta's 
moments of self-seclusion seemed to be attempts at escaping 
from the intensity of the feelings evoked by mental closeness to 
the analyst. However, while clearly defensive, these gaps in the 
narrative could not, at least at the time, be interpreted. The 
experiences had no meaning for Henrietta, and she was unable 
to reflect on them. They appear, to that extent, to be analogous 
to the play of a 2-year-old child, which cannot yet admit play­
mates and takes place within a subjective world radically sev-Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 419 
ered from the world outside. We could say that Henrietta imag­
ined that she was at her father's funeral, but at that moment 
she had no awareness of an act of imagination. The suspension 
of mentalization, triggered by the threats that attachment rela­
tionships bring, throws into relief the persistence of the infantile 
mode of experiencing psychic reality, which we have called the 
"pretend mode." Perhaps a key part of dissociation as a phenom­
enon is the reemergence of the pretend mode—the mode in 
which the very young child fully enters a separate psychic world 
and cannot simultaneously maintain contact with ordinary 
reality. 
The Alien Self 
The lack of a stable sense of self is a central difficulty for 
borderline patients. We have written elsewhere about the role of 
reflective function in self-organization (Fonagy and Target 1997). 
The patient lacks an authentic, organic self-image built around 
internalized representations of self-states. The absence or weak­
ness of such a self-image leaves the child, and later the adult, 
with affect that remains unlabelled and confusing—uncontained 
(Bion 1962a). The absence of a reflective object for the child's 
experience creates a vacuum within the self, where internal 
reality remains nameless, sometimes dreaded. This will create a 
desperation for meaning and a willingness to take in reflections 
from the other that do not map onto anything within the child's 
own experience. We suggest that this leads to the internalization 
of representations of the parent's state, rather than of a usable 
version of the child's own experience. This creates what we term 
an "alien experience within the self," based on representations of 
the other within the self. This may be close to what Britton 
(1998) described in similar terms, on the basis of clinical work 
with patients such as these. Once internalized, the alien pres­
ence interferes with the relationship between thought and iden­
tity: ideas or feelings that do not seem to belong to the self are 
experienced. The alien self destroys the sense of coherence of 
self, which can only be restored by constant and intense projec-

contrast to the neurotic case—the projection is motivated not by 
superego pressures but by the need to establish a basic continu­
ity of self-experience. 
With Henrietta, dreams were like small oases in a cruel desert 
of enactments and manipulations, which all but destroyed the 
possibility of reflectiveness. The dreams were vivid and varied, 
but I gradually noticed a consistent theme. There was always 
something within something else, and the thing within was 
absolutely dependent—almost parasitic—upon the thing with­
out. For example, there was a dream about a lizard with a fly 
buzzing inside its stomach. She had a particularly unpleasant 
recurrent dream that a beetle's larva was growing inside her 
brain. She had a whole series of dreams where she dreamt that 
she was dreaming another dream. I came to believe that in 
patients incapable of reflectiveness, dreams still provide a valu­
able window. Perhaps dreams are, in part, residues of a nascent 
reflective capacity where the dreamer tries unconsciously to 
depict the structural constellation within his mind (the state 
that precludes intentional reflection). 
In these Russian-doll constellations, Henrietta perhaps repre­
sented an inner world in which a self contained another self or, 
in fact, a representation of the other. This could be internalized 
in early infancy when the mother's reflective function too often 
failed the infant. The infant, trying to find herself in the mother's 
mind may find—as Winnicott (1967, p. 32) so accurately put it— 
the mother instead1. The image of the mother would come to 
colonize the self. This alien other probably exists in seed form in 
all our self-representations. It may come into its own when later 
trauma calls it forth as part of a defensive maneuver: identifying 
with the state of mind of the abuser, in an attempt to restore a 
feeling of control. The alien other within the self, fostered by 
maltreatment, is unmasked by the absence of reflective function. 
Normally, parts of the self-representation that are not rooted 
in the internalized mirroring of self-states are nevertheless in­
tegrated into a singular, fairly coherent self-structure by the 
capacity for mentalization. This process preconsciously works to 
lend a coherence and psychological meaning to one's life, ac­
tions, and identity. Henrietta lacked the capacity to understand Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 421 
the experience of the buzzing fly inside her self-representation, 
or to metabolize the feelings and ideas that she experienced as 
having been placed there, like a larva in her brain. Henrietta 
could learn little about herself through interpretations of this 
kind, yet the mental language of the analyst's communications 
strengthened her reflective capacities, which in turn strength­
ened the integrity of the self. Let us illustrate what we mean by 
elaborating on her experience of having been abused and of her 
own violence. 
Henrietta's mother, probably herself a "survivor," had suf­
fered a prolonged postnatal depression after the birth of her 
second child when Henrietta was 2 years old. She withdrew 
almost completely from both Henrietta and her father, and even­
tually she left the family. This probably exacerbated the father's 
already considerable drug problems, and he began to seek solace 
at first from cuddling and finally from vaginally and then anally 
penetrating his daughter. This had apparently begun when she 
was about 7 years old and had gone on for at least four years. 
Henrietta recalled initially welcoming his attention (even encour­
aging it) and gradually, when "the pain" started, going blank, 
which helped him get inside her. She described imagining her­
self as one of her dolls. This meant that she blocked any aware­
ness of thoughts and feelings in herself and the other. It was 
impossible for her to understand how her father could mean to 
hurt her as part of what grew out of an act of affection. The 
disavowal of mental states gave her distance from what he might 
have felt, as well as from her own feelings. As she turned away 
these, she was forced to rely on the nonreflective organization 
within the self—the alien other. 
The alien other is not entirely a creation of trauma. It is an 
infantile structure internalized in place of, yet also within, parts 
of the self. Henrietta's mother of infancy could probably not 
satisfy her baby's need for reflection of her distress and her 
needs. (Her daughter's dependency may have been an unbear­
able reminder of her own experience of helplessness—by all 
accounts she did better with her. son.) We suggest that Henrietta, 
neglected or unrecognized as a small child, internalized a blank 
image of absence as the representation of her state of distress. 
This state was reactivated in the acute distress of seduction and.

later, when these experiences were relived in analysis. Reflective­
ness temporarily abandoned and the self-other boundary de­
stroyed, the abusing father's cruelty was then internalized into 
the alien self-representation through a process that may be 
related to the mechanism whereby the victim identifies with the 
aggressor. Thus, the alien part of the self became torturing as 
well as vacuous. Her experience of abuse at boarding school, 
after the age of 11, presumably reinforced this pathological self-
organization. 
Finding others to be a vehicle for this torturing part of her 
self-representation became vital. Her experience of self-coher­
ence depended on finding someone willing to abuse her. The 
teacher was perhaps the first. A series of severely sadomasochis­
tic relationships showed that he was certainly not the last. The 
transference was a lived instance. In contrast to the "role-
responsiveness" model of transference-countertransference (Jo­
seph 1985; Sandler 1976), where an aspect of the self-other 
relationship is externalized, a self-self transference evolved, in 
which the analyst became a temporary home to the alien aspect 
of Henrietta's self-representation. These instances of evocatory 
projective identification (Spillius 1992) are pervasive for two 
reasons: (a) as we have already mentioned, the normal binding 
of alien aspects of the self by mentalization does not occur, 
and therefore these aspects are more likely to be externalized, 
(b) Even more critically, once these experiences are created, they 
are actually far more compelling for these individuals, because 
they are experienced in a mode of psychic equivalence. Let us 
give a relatively mild example. 
One day Henrietta came in late, complaining that she could 
no longer park her car for free. The change in parking regula­
tions was somehow my fault. It was also my fault that she could 
not afford the parking fees, and I was going to be away again the 
following week. In fact, her lack of progress was entirely down to 
me. She had heard* of a senior Kleinian colleague who was 
renowned for her abilities to deal with difficult patients. She 
wished she had been referred to her. /was a disaster. She would 
have gone on, but, as far as I was concerned, she had said 
enough. I said, perhaps attempting to imitate the colleague 
whose reputation I envy and failing to recognize the obvious Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 423 
manipulativeness: "You are trying to destroy my ability to help 
you, to think about you clearly." This was a misunderstanding. I 
think she had no intention to destroy me but, rather, a wish to 
bring forth a critical, irritated reaction. She was silent for a while 
and then said, "You see. I was right. You can't cope. You are too 
young, too inexperienced." I found myself saying, "You see, you 
are frightened! You may have destroyed me, but without me you 
can't cope and you feel lost." She got up, said, "For me, you and 
this analysis are dead," and walked out of the session. 
Of course, as soon as she left, I knew I had misunderstood. I 
had become the vehicle for her alien self by becoming critical 
and irritated, and I had ^abandoned my analytic self with some 
capacity to communicate understanding. This was confirmed in 
the next session, when she came in, feeling a lot better, full of 
apologies, hoping that I was not too angry with her, reassuring 
me left, right, and center about how helpful I was being and that 
she would surely have killed herself by now were it not for my 
remarkable commitment and skills. I said, "I think you hope that 
I will believe you, because that will confirm your picture of me as 
conceited and stupid. What you said yesterday was far closer to 
what you need to feel about me." She said, contemptuously, 
"Don't you realize it makes no difference what you think? You 
mean nothing to me. Nothing!" I said, "I think you are right. But 
being able to make me into someone who means nothing to you 
makes you feel in control, and that makes all the difference." She 
thought for a moment and then said, "You are just clever with 
words, like my teacher X (the abuser). You are evil. You care 
nothing about your patients." I said, "If you can make it so that 
you can see me as evil, then you can kill me, and then you will be 
free." She fell silent, but the sense was that we both knew that 
this was the truth. 
Not that stating the truth ever necessarily made Henrietta feel 
better—it made her sad and sometimes suicidal. What seemed to 
be helpful were those few precious moments (like this last ses­
sion) when I could'become what she needed me to be, yet retain 
my capacity to hold her in mind with her fears and anxieties and 
enable her to see this in, my words and actions.

later, when these experiences were relived in analysis. Reflective­
ness temporarily abandoned and the self-other boundary de­
stroyed, the abusing father's cruelty was then internalized into 
the alien self-representation through a process that may be 
related to the mechanism whereby the victim identifies with the 
aggressor. Thus, the alien part of the self became torturing as 
well as vacuous. Her experience of abuse at boarding school, 
after the age of 11, presumably reinforced this pathological self-
organization. 
Finding others to be a vehicle for this torturing part of her 
self-representation became vital. Her experience of self-coher­
ence depended on finding someone willing to abuse her. The 
teacher was perhaps the first. A series of severely sadomasochis­
tic relationships showed that he was certainly not the last. The 
transference was a lived instance. In contrast to the "role-
responsiveness" model of transference-countertransference (Jo­
seph 1985; Sandler 1976), where an aspect of the self-other 
relationship is externalized, a self-self transference evolved, in 
which the analyst became a temporary home to the alien aspect 
of Henrietta's self-representation. These instances of evocatory 
projective identification (Spillius 1992) are pervasive for two 
reasons: (a) as we have already mentioned, the normal binding 
of alien aspects of the self by mentalization does not occur, 
and therefore these aspects are more likely to be externalized, 
(b) Even more critically, once these experiences are created, they 
are actually far more compelling for these individuals, because 
they are experienced in a mode of psychic equivalence. Let us 
give a relatively mild example. 
One day Henrietta came in late, complaining that she could 
no longer park her car for free. The change in parking regula­
tions was somehow my fault. It was also my fault that she could 
not afford the parking fees, and I was going to be away again the 
following week. In fact, her lack of progress was entirely down to 
me. She had heard* of a senior Kleinian colleague who was 
renowned for her abilities to deal with difficult patients. She 
wished she had been referred to her. /was a disaster. She would

dependency might appear as classical secure-base behavior, I 
never felt that. I was able to offer her much by way of safety or 
protection. Rather, I was required as an assurance of her exist­
ence. Her mind was unable to sustain an experience of continu­
ity as an agent. Only in relation to her impression of the impact 
of her thoughts and feelings on me could she experience these as 
enduring and stable. As we have said before, this process should 
not be seen as an attempt to recapitulate a developmental expe­
rience that was, in Henrietta's case, deeply distorted. More sim­
ply, her terror of abandonment reflected an intrapsychic state of 
affairs where she was not confident of being able to locate her 
intentional states once separated from her object. 
Over its fourth year, her analysis began.to take on a tragic 
quality, and the dramatic outbursts receded. She was function­

sions of bitterness. Hatred for her father had begun to emerge, 
together with a heart-felt dislike of me. The transference could 
now become sexualized, and at times, when she was angry with 
me, she explicitly asked me to molest her. She came in one 
Thursday evening and recounted a particularly ghastly episode 
of allowing herself to be used and abused by "an old friend" who 
regularly visited her as his needs dictated. My mind was filled 
with bizarre and perverse associations. I said that I suspected 
that it was particularly important to feel that she could control 
me by exciting me or worrying me, and I suspected that she had 
felt the same vital sense of control in relation to her "old friend." 
She responded that she hadn't been going to tell me but that 
she had had a dream about me where J had offered her my penis, 
suggesting that she should take it in her mouth. She was revolted 
by it because it was smelly and dirty. She was frightened because 
she knew I was going to beat her unless she submitted. She 
paused, waiting for me to say something. I remained silent. She 
said that she thought that I was probably extremely clean since I 
always wore well-ironed white shirts. But in the dream my shirt 
was deep red. She added, speaking particularly calmly, that red 
was the color of anger. 
I said that I understood very well how important it was for her 
to:feel that she was in control, because .she was terrified that I 
would be angry because of what she had done with her friend. Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 425 
The dream was like an appeasement. If she sensed that I was 
repelled, it was better for me to be dead. I added that red was 
also the color of blood. Her body shook as if an electric current 
had passed through it. "I think that is why I had to kill him," she 
said. "I couldn't bear him thinking I was disgusting." The tragic 
story unfolded. She had regularly allowed herself to be mal­
treated by her boyfriend. Normally, she had felt "cleansed" by the 
experience, particularly by his shame about his own actions. 
But on the final occasion she saw contempt in his eyes. She 
screamed and shouted at him. He ridiculed and disparaged her. 
She picked up the knife, and as he moved toward her, still 
mocking and sneering, she stabbed him. And with it she hoped 
to have killed her self-hatred and humiliation. 
My work with Henrietta has now ended. She improved enor­
mously in terms of both structural and symptomatic criteria— 
yet horror and despair were never far away, right until the end. 
Psychic Equivalence and Violent Enactment 
Why is the brutalization of attachment so potent a trigger for 
violence? We believe that the brutalization of affectional bonds 
serves to partially deactivate the attachment system in specific 
contexts and suggests that the malign nature of brutalization 
experiences is rooted in the intensity of the humiliation associ­
ated with them. The absence of the capacity for mentalization 
and the reemergence of psychic equivalence make individuals 
with a history of psychological neglect exceptionally vulnerable 
to brutalization in these contexts. The attacks cannot be attenu­
ated by mentalization of the pain engendered by the dehumani-
zation of attachment. Unmentalized shame is not an "as-if 
experience. It is tantamount to the destruction of the self. It 
would not be an exaggeration to label this emotion "ego-destruc­
tive shame" (Gilligan 1997). The coherence of the self-representa­
tion—identity itself—is under attack. The ability to mentalize 
would mitigate this process, permitting the individual to con­

figure at that moment. The more robust the capacity for mental­
ization, the more easily the person may see what lies behind the 
attack, its meaning, and not mistake it for the possibility of a 
real destruction of the ego. The intensity of the humiliation 
might be the immediate cause of the- inhibition of mentalization 
following abuse: all things felt to be internal (subjectivity) be­
come experiences to be resisted. In describing her experience of 
brutalization, Henrietta reported finding the very act of thinking 
unbearable: "I stopped thinking" ... "I went numb" ... "I could 
not bear to think." 
Why should the brutalization of affectional bonds, whether in 
the context of relationships with parents or with intimate peers, 
be associated with such an intense and destructive sense of self-
disgust verging on self-hatred? Once again, there is a paradox: 
the shame concerns being treated as a physical object in the very 
context where special personal recognition is expected. Over­
whelming mental pain is associated with experiencing a discrep­
ancy between the representation of an actual self, based on how 
one is being treated and the representation of the ideal shape of 
the self (Joffe and Sandler 1967). The expectation of being seen 
and understood as a feeling and thinking person, which is 
created by the attachment context, clashes violently with the 
brutalized person's objectification and dehumanization. Shame 
is a higher-order derivative of this basic affect of pain. Unbear­
able shame is generated through the incongruity of having one's 
humanity negated, exactly when one is legitimately expecting to 
be cherished. Violence or the threat of violence to the body kills 
the soul because it is the ultimate way of communicating the 
absence of love by the person inflicting the violence, from whom 
understanding is expected. As Freud (1914c) taught us, the self 
is. sustained by the love of the object, so it can become self-love; 
the sign of a self starved of love is shame, just as cold is the 
indication of an absence of heat (Gilligan 1997). And, just like 
cold, shame, while painful as an acute experience, is, when it is 
intense and severe, experienced as a feeling of numbness or 
deadness. 
The state of humiliation can only be erased through selective 
but deep disavowal of the subjectivities of both the object and Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 427 
the self. A prisoner who was incarcerated for aggravated assault 
recalled his alcoholic father urinating on him and on his sister 
regularly when he returned home late at night from drinking. He 
reported that his terror of his father coming home at a certain 
point changed into an explicit wish to maim and disfigure him. 
At that point, he said, "The fucking bastard stopped existing for 
me." In many criminals a similar dramatic reconfiguration of the 
self seems to take place. There is a turning point when the 
normal barrier against intentionally injuring another human is 
penetrated. From this point, the person appears to feel no re­
morse for violent acts performed on others. A state that might be 
mistaken for psychopathy sets in. The word "functional" might 
be inserted before psychopathy since the disappearance of inter­
personal sensibility is thought to be defensive, temporary, and 
reversible. It should not, therefore, be considered a deficit but, 
rather, an adaptation. So far we have talked about the predispo­
sition to violent crime. This must be distinguished from the act 
of violence itself. While the predisposition involves the destruc­
tion of interpersonal awareness in a specific context, I would 
suggest that the act of violence itself represents the perverted 
restoration of a rudimentary mentalizing function. 
There is a traditional psychoanalytic assumption that vio­
lence is an act of madness—the ego's abandonment of logical 
thought in favor of primitive and profoundly destructive im­
pulses. The act of violence, whether impulsive or calculated, is 
rarely one of blind rage. Rather, it is a desperate attempt to 
protect the fragile self against the onslaught of shame, often 
innocently triggered by an other. The experience of humiliation, 
which the individual tries to contain within the alien part of the 
self, comes to represent an existential threat and is therefore 
abruptly externalized. Once outside and perceived as part of the 
representation of the victim in the perpetrator's mind, it is seen 
as possible to destroy once and for all. In this sense violence is a 
gesture of hope, a wish for a new beginning, even if in reality it is 
usually just a tragic end. 
We suggest that it is important, in understanding borderline 
states, to grasp the sense of psychic equivalence between a state 
of mind and a physical reality. Henrietta's victim did not symbol-

We suggest that it is important, in understanding borderline 
states, to grasp the sense of psychic equivalence between a state 
of mind and a physical reality. Henrietta's victim did not symbol-

428 / Clinical Perspectives 
ize an attitude or a mental state—he was killed because he was, 
at that moment, the embodiment of her shame, and destroying 
him was also felt to destroy the unbearable mental state. Small 
children are generally not physically capable of dealing with 
their intolerable feelings in this way, but adults who experience 
their internal worlds in such ways can be dangerous to them­
selves and others. 
Henrietta resorted to violence to destroy a mental state—a 
mental state that was hers and yet did not feel like hers. At the 
moment of the murder, her object turned from feeling her shame 
to shaming her—a feeling she was desperate to disown. She had 
tried to disown it, but when it threatened to return, murder 
seemed the only solution. She felt a terror that the coherence of 
her self would be destroyed. The act of violence was felt to 
destroy both her shame and this terror. Her unconscious hope 
seemed to be that they would then be gone forever. 
The lack of a capacity to mentalize reveals the alien self as 
much as it creates it. It also reveals a mode of thinking where 
feelings and thoughts feel real and only one version of reality is 
possible. The impact of her boyfriend's affect could not be 
reinterpreted or put into context through mentalization. Her 
primitive experience of psychic reality, which equated external 
with internal, made her into a joke and threatened the actual 
destruction of her sense of self. Psychic equivalence makes hu­
miliation a matter of life and death. The killing that ensued was 
not lacking in empathy, an act of "blind rage." It seemed essen­
tial that she saw his reaction and, within that, something that 
she would otherwise have had to experience as part of herself. 
His struggle and suffering were vital features of the experience 
as she later went over it in analysis. At the moment of murder 
Henrietta felt alive, coherent, and real, out of reach of the deadly 
rejections, insults, and taunts, and momentarily for once experi­
encing self-respect. She described having felt a strange but deep 
tranquility. 
Henrietta needed her abusers—the analyst in countertrans­
ference enactments and a series of others who, through their 
maltreatment of her, helped her temporarily reduce the unbear­
able sense of diffused identity. The other who performs this Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 429 
function must remain present for this complex process to oper­
ate. Henrietta could not feel that she was herself unless she had 
her analyst or someone else to frighten,, and humiliate. Alterna­
tively, she would attempt to provoke the analyst to become 
rejecting and contemptuous. However, having succeeded in pro­
voking such reactions, she felt attacked by the immediacy and 
reality of.her perceptions, which were too compelling to be juxta­
posed with other experiences with the object. Nor is escape from 
the object a solution—with the departure of the other person 
the "exterojects" would return, destroying the coherence she 
achieved by projection. 
The seemingly impossible challenge presented by patients 
such as Henrietta and Emma is, we believe, rooted in this aspect 
of the transference. For the relationship to serve a function and 
to be tolerable, the analyst has to become what the patient 
wishes him to be. But at these moments he is likely to be too 
terrifying to be able to offer help that can be accepted. To be an 
analyst and help the patient overcome such primitive modes of 
relating, the analyst must be anything but what is projected 
onto him. Unless he is able to juggle responses to these opposing 
pressures, the analysis is doomed to become a rigid repetition of 
pathological exchanges. 
Part of the difficulty undoubtedly arises out of the pressure 
we inevitably feel as clinicians to enact that which is projected 
onto us. We are pushed, to be as our patients wish us to be 
because we sense that without this, prolonged contact with us 
might be intolerable. This, of course, happens to a degree in any 
transference situation, but it is vital to appreciate the difference 
introduced when the patient is experiencing events primarily in 
the mode of psychic equivalence. If ordinary transference experi­
ences are illusions, the experience of borderline patients is felt 
as a delusion it seems unquestionably real. Because, as ana­
lysts, we try extremely hard not to react as expected to provoca­
tion, we unwittingly push borderline patients to become even 
more difficult. All such patients get under our skin and eventu­
ally discover what will make us react with anger, what will cause 
us to neglect or reject them or to feel excited by them, in all 
instances temporarily losing our therapeutic balance.

much as it creates it. It also reveals a mode of thinking where 
feelings and thoughts feel real and only one version of reality is 
possible. The impact of her boyfriend's affect could not be 
reinterpreted or put into context through mentalization. Her 
primitive experience of psychic reality, which equated external 
with internal, made her into a joke and threatened the actual 
destruction of her sense of self. Psychic equivalence makes hu­
miliation a matter of life and death. The killing that ensued was 
not lacking in empathy, an act of "blind rage." It seemed essen­
tial that she saw his reaction and, within that, something that 
she would otherwise have had to experience as part of herself. 
His struggle and suffering were vital features of the experience 
as she later went over it in analysis. At the moment of murder 
Henrietta felt alive, coherent, and real, out of reach of the deadly 
rejections, insults, and taunts, and momentarily for once experi­
encing self-respect. She described having felt a strange but deep 
tranquility. 
Henrietta needed her abusers—the analyst in countertrans­
ference enactments and a series of others who, through their 
maltreatment of her, helped her temporarily reduce the unbear­
able sense of diffused identity. The other who performs this Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 429 
function must remain present for this complex process to oper­
ate. Henrietta could not feel that she was herself unless she had 
her analyst or someone else to frighten,, and humiliate. Alterna­
tively, she would attempt to provoke the analyst to become 
rejecting and contemptuous. However, having succeeded in pro­
voking such reactions, she felt attacked by the immediacy and 
reality of.her perceptions, which were too compelling to be juxta­
posed with other experiences with the object. Nor is escape from 
the object a solution—with the departure of the other person 
the "exterojects" would return, destroying the coherence she 
achieved by projection. 
The seemingly impossible challenge presented by patients 
such as Henrietta and Emma is, we believe, rooted in this aspect 
of the transference. For the relationship to serve a function and 
to be tolerable, the analyst has to become what the patient 
wishes him to be. But at these moments he is likely to be too 
terrifying to be able to offer help that can be accepted. To be an 
analyst and help the patient overcome such primitive modes of 
relating, the analyst must be anything but what is projected 
onto him. Unless he is able to juggle responses to these opposing 
pressures, the analysis is doomed to become a rigid repetition of 
pathological exchanges. 
Part of the difficulty undoubtedly arises out of the pressure 
we inevitably feel as clinicians to enact that which is projected 
onto us. We are pushed, to be as our patients wish us to be 
because we sense that without this, prolonged contact with us 
might be intolerable. This, of course, happens to a degree in any 
transference situation, but it is vital to appreciate the difference 
introduced when the patient is experiencing events primarily in 
the mode of psychic equivalence. If ordinary transference experi­
ences are illusions, the experience of borderline patients is felt 
as a delusion it seems unquestionably real. Because, as ana­
lysts, we try extremely hard not to react as expected to provoca­
tion, we unwittingly push borderline patients to become even 
more difficult. All such patients get under our skin and eventu­
ally discover what will make us react with anger, what will cause 
us to neglect or reject them or to feel excited by them, in all 
instances temporarily losing our therapeutic balance.

Between the Psychic Equivalence 
and the Pretend Mode 
As with- Emma, we believe that with Henrietta an appropriate 
technical priority was the survival of the analyst's picture of the 
patient's mental state in his mind. It was vital that Henrietta did 
not succeed in destroying the perception of herself as a person, 
which she needed if she were gradually to discover this image of 
herself in his mind, to gain a foothold for her own representation 
of her thoughts and feelings. 
This description might create the impression that patients 
such as Henrietta cannot respond to psychoanalysis; interpre­
tation necessarily involves some openness to an alternative 
perspective. In the adult mind, however, repudiation of mental­
ization is in reality never absolute. It is likely to be greatest at 
moments of particular stress and/or in attachment relation­
ships; hence the patient has some experience of mentalizing in 
other contexts that can begin to be built on. The analyst precon-
sciously assesses how much openness there might be and aims 
progressively to enlarge that space, if only very slowly. There are 
wide, moment-to-moment variations in the capacity available, 
and interventions need to be titrated against the current poten­

Anthony Bateman (1997) described the same phenomenon 
sensitively in the context of Rosenfeld's (1964) distinction be­
tween thick-skinned and thin-skinned narcissists. Extending 
Rosenfeld's description, Bateman argued that narcissists alter­
nate between the thick-skinned (derogatory and grandiose) 
and thin-skinned (vulnerable and self-loathing) states. Bateman 
shows that interpretive work can only be done with such pa­
tients at the dangerous moments when they are in movement 
from one state to the other. We think what Bateman describes is 
the successful externalization of the alien self (derogatory or self-
hating). The externalization of the persecutory object within the 
self leaves the patient able to listen and even experience concern.

The analyst needs to be in a dual functioning mode, to infer and 
create a coherent representation of the patient's true self, sepa­
rate from but concurrently with any countertransference enact­
ment. However, this is where analysis often fails, because as 
soon as the patient hears anything other than what he projected, 
he must once again be on the alert. He might be risking the 
return of his laboriously ejected introject. 
One risk of treatment for these patients is that the analyst 
will present the patient with more than he is able to absorb, 
overwhelming the residual capacity truly to understand. This 
might result either in an overflow into action or, perhaps, in the 
development of a false "analytic" attitude, which we have called 
"hyperactive mentalizing." In contrast, a lack of ambition to 
expand the patient's experience of psychic reality, as in some 
supportive psychotherapy, misses the opportunity of increasing 
affect regulation, and, as intense attachment to the analyst 
develops, so the need to create their feelings in action is likely to 
escalate, and serious suicide attempts may be the result. 
In this context, there is the further danger also touched on in 
connection with Emma's case of crediting the patient's material 
with more meaning than it really contains. Henrietta, like many 
other similar patients, brought much pseudo-symbolic commu­
nication, especially in the early phases of her treatment. Her 
words referred to internal states, yet after a while it became 
clear that their meaning had little in common with the way other 
patients might have described feelings or fantasies. Normal in­
terpretive dialogue seemed mostly useless; in Henrietta's case it 
created an endless stream of words without leading to real 
change. Analysis of borderline patients can switch into a pre­
tend mode in which words are exchanged but meaning and 
therefore psychic change are elusive; patients' verbalizations of 
mental state are, of necessity, "pseudo-insights," as they cannot 
link to the patient's primary level of internal experience. The 
progress of such an analysis might resemble that of a car whose 
wheels are spinning in sand. The overestimation of the patient's 
mental capacity, the assumption that her psychic reality is 
experienced like that of the analyst, can lead to a fruitless 
search after truth. Mentalization can exist separately from the

actual affective experience but this is worth little, certainly in a 
therapeutic context. 
Interpretations in the classical sense have no place in the 
early phases with such patients. Some enactment on the part of 
the analyst is inevitable; a realistic aim is for him to retain 
sufficient insight to be able to continue to reflect on his experi­
ence to the patient. Henrietta's analyst had to teach her about 
an inner world, principally by opening his mind to her experi­
ence. "Deep" interpretations felt like taunts, intrusions, distrac­
tions, or seductions. The appropriate focus seemed to be the 
exploration of triggers for feelings, small changes in mental 
states, highlighting differences in perceptions of the same event 
and bringing awareness of the intricate relationships between 
action and feeling, as in the analyst's response to her nonverbal 
gestures in-the early phase of the treatment. Such interpretive 
work as there was had to have a strict focus on the consulting-
room and on the feelings and attitudes of patient and analyst. 
(Note that if the term "transference" is used in this context, it is 
being used somewhat differently from the traditional definition— 
see Sandler, Dare, and Holder 1992.) The patient's actions in 
relation to the analyst—such as the terrifying para-suicidal be­
havior that was the backdrop to Henrietta's treatment—are not 
seen by us as unconsciously intended communications, but as 
desperate reactions to intolerable intimacy. The analyst's task is 
to elaborate on the emotional states that might have triggered 
the enactment. The difficulty is the preservation of the "as-if 
nature of the therapeutic exercise in the face of the powerful, 
intrusive projections that the analyst also has to accept. Some­
times there is a place for humor or playfulness in the struggle 
with psychic equivalent modes of functioning, but naturally this 
requires much delicacy and judgment of the patient's likely 
experience of this approach. 
The psychotherapist's mentalistic elaborative stance enables 
the patient ultimately to find himself in the therapist's mind and 
integrate this image as part of his sense of himself. In successful 
treatment, the patient gradually comes to accept that feelings 
can safely be felt and ideas may safely be thought about. There is 
a gradual shift to experience of the internal world as separate 
and qualitatively different from external reality (Fonagy and Tar-Psychic Reality in Borderline States / 433 
get 1996). This is part of a maturational process that was, we 
suggest, defensively abandoned by these patients in an attempt 
to avoid overwhelming conflict. 
Through all these devices, the analyst adopts a nonpragmatic 
elaborative, mentalistic stance, which places a demand on the 
patient to focus on the mental state of a benevolent other. This 
stance in itself enhances or disinhibits the patient's biological 
propensity for reflection and self-reflection. Perhaps more impor­
tant, he is able to find himself in the mind of the therapist as a 
thinking and feeling being—the representation that never fully 
developed in early childhood and was probably further under­
mined by subsequent painful interpersonal experience. In this 
way, the patient's core self-structure is strengthened and suffi­
cient control is acquired over mental representations of internal 
states so that psychotherapeutic work proper can begin. Even 
if work were to stop here, much would have been achieved in 
terms of making behaviors understandable, meaningful, and 
predictable. The internalization of the analyst's concern with

Mentalized Affectivity 
in the Clinical Setting 
In this chapter, we focus on the idea of mentalized affectivity, 
which will allow us to elaborate on a form of affect regulation 
that is particularly relevant for adults. As introduced in chapter 
2, mentalized affectivity is a sophisticated kind of affect regula­
tion that denotes how affects are experienced through the lens of 
self-reflexivity. It would be mistaken to assume that all adults 
are capable of such affectivity; yet neither is it a rarified achieve­
ment. As we demonstrate in this chapter, mentalized affectivity 
is a concept that can be enhanced by psychotherapy and thus 
pertains to a phenomenon that is especially relevant to the 
clinical realm. In the first section of this chapter we begin with a 
description of mentalized affectivity as a concept, in the second 
we delineate three elements of mentalized affectivity, and in 
the third we turn to four clinical examples to illustrate its 
importance. 
THE CONCEPT OF MENTALIZED AFFECTIVITY 
Affects are mental states that can be subjectively or uncon­
sciously experienced. Affect regulation is a process of crafting 
mental states in accordance with a sense of agency. It occurs 
435 

436 / Clinical Perspectives 
at different levels—from something like homeostatic regulation, 
which occurs without awareness, to self-regulation through our 
relations with others, in which awareness is critical. It is fair to 
assume that the more familiar one is with one's subjective ex­
perience, the more effective regulation can be. Correspondingly, 
the more advanced one is with affect regulation, the closer it is 
to self-regulation. Mentalized affectivity transcends being a state 
or a process; in its ultimate form, it bears a close relation to 
character style. It is important to appreciate, however, that not 
all forms of mentalization have to do with affective experience. 
Mentalized affectivity is predicated upon familiarity as well as 
a sense of comfort with one's own subjective experience. Indeed, 
such affectivity presumes an agent who is self-reflective. What 
distinguishes mentalized affectivity from other points of view— 
like the one where cognition is applied to determine and alter 
affective experience—is that the agent remains within or recap­
tures the affective state. As anyone engaged in psychotherapy 
recognizes, there is a profound difference between abstract self-
understanding and the kind of insight that is mediated by live 
affective experience. 
Through mentalized affectivity, one acquires a more complex 
understanding of one's own affective experience. This will often 
mean that affects are rendered into new and/or subtler shapes; 
however, it does not necessarily require that affects are trans­
formed in nature. It is possible that mentalized affectivity directs 
us to appreciate new meanings in the same affects, not simply to 
create new affects. Affectivity of this sort has the aim of promot­
ing positive affect, but it should also help us to be able to accept 
and cope with negative affect. In its essence, mentalized affectiv­
ity designates the human need to fathom and reinterpret one's 
affects and is particularly exemplified through the internal ex­
pression of affects. As we have argued throughout this book, 
mentalization denotes interest in one's mind in general. The 
term "affectivity" denotes interest in one's own affects—that is, 
in a specific domain of one's mind. The term "mentalized affec­
tivity" describes how affect regulation is transformed by mental­
ization. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 437 
THE ELEMENTS OF MENTALIZED AFFECTIVITY 
Having characterized mentalized affectivity broadly, let us ad­
dress its composition in a more specific way. This will provide a 
deeper understanding of the concept, and it will also serve as 
a basis for how the concept might be operationalized for the 
purposes of research. There are three elements of mentalized 
affectivity: identifying, modulating, and expressing affects. Each 
of the three elements has a basic and more complex form. As we 
imagine it, identifying affects is the prelude to modulating them. 
It is not impossible to change what one feels without knowing 
what it is; however, it is most plausible that regulating/modulat­
ing one's affect will depend upon having some awareness of the 
affect itself. Similarly, expressing one's affects is contingent here 
upon modulation; on our account, though, it is also important to 
realize that affects can be expressed inwardly as well as out­
wardly. 
Let us take a closer look at each of the three individual 
elements. In its most basic form, identifying affects will mean 
naming the basic emotion that one feels. There are some pa­
tients who, one might begin to notice, characteristically avoid 
naming their affects or in some cases omit the names of specific 
affects. The process of understanding what this means must 
commence with the attempt to clarify whether the patient is just 
somewhat uncomfortable with or is actually in ignorance about 
the affect in question. Indeed, one can glimpse how readily the 
matter of naming affects can be complicated and is not necessar­
ily a straightforward matter of knowing what state one is in. 
Someone can be confused about what he feels—that is, whether 
it is one affect or another or some combination of both. In 
instances where one feels a combination of affects, it can be 
worth while to,sort out the relative degrees of each affect. 
The complex aspect of identifying affects is exemplified by 
cases in which there are links—sometimes hidden ones— 
between affects. An example would be of someone who, when­
ever he feels angry, undergoes a shift to becoming anxious. Some 
such links may be predictable, like oscillation between anger 
and sadness when one is disappointed in love. Other links can

at different levels—from something like homeostatic regulation, 
which occurs without awareness, to self-regulation through our 
relations with others, in which awareness is critical. It is fair to 
assume that the more familiar one is with one's subjective ex­
perience, the more effective regulation can be. Correspondingly, 
the more advanced one is with affect regulation, the closer it is 
to self-regulation. Mentalized affectivity transcends being a state

THE ELEMENTS OF MENTALIZED AFFECTIVITY 
Having characterized mentalized affectivity broadly, let us ad­
dress its composition in a more specific way. This will provide a 
deeper understanding of the concept, and it will also serve as 
a basis for how the concept might be operationalized for the

wardly. 
Let us take a closer look at each of the three individual 
elements. In its most basic form, identifying affects will mean 
naming the basic emotion that one feels. There are some pa­
tients who, one might begin to notice, characteristically avoid 
naming their affects or in some cases omit the names of specific 
affects. The process of understanding what this means must 
commence with the attempt to clarify whether the patient is just 
somewhat uncomfortable with or is actually in ignorance about 
the affect in question. Indeed, one can glimpse how readily the 
matter of naming affects can be complicated and is not necessar­
ily a straightforward matter of knowing what state one is in. 
Someone can be confused about what he feels—that is, whether 
it is one affect or another or some combination of both. In 
instances where one feels a combination of affects, it can be 
worth while to,sort out the relative degrees of each affect. 
The complex aspect of identifying affects is exemplified by 
cases in which there are links—sometimes hidden ones— 
between affects. An example would be of someone who, when­
ever he feels angry, undergoes a shift to becoming anxious. Some 
such links may be predictable, like oscillation between anger 
and sadness when one is disappointed in love. Other links can 

438 / Clinical Perspectives 
be more unusual, as in the patient who, whenever she becomes 
angry, quickly moves to explain it away by focusing sympathetic 
and even warm attention on the motivation of the agent who had 
caused her to be angry. Thus, beyond the task of naming affects, 
identifying affects can include the process of discerning the 
relation among distinct affects. 
In its basic form, modulating affects will mean that the affect 
is altered in some way. This can entail modifications in intensity 
or duration, or it can refer to more subtle adjustments, where 
the affect is refined. Modulation can mean that the affect is 
sustained as well as adjusted upward or downward. One of us 
has a highly narcissistic patient (see "Scott," below), who, just 
after hearing that a woman on whom he had a crush was getting 
engaged, announced that he was "feeling pretty good." Upon 
further exploration, he claimed not that he had not been sad 
about this news, but that his sadness had subsided. This seems 
like a case in which modulation might serve to sustain the affect 
in order for the patient to experience 'it fully, rather than either 
increase or decrease it. It is easy to imagine examples in which 
someone clings persistently to negative affects—let us say anger 
or resentment—in a way that colors too much of his experience. 
This would mean that modulation points to the value of adjust­
ing the negative affect downward. 
The complex form of affectivity concerns the revaluing of 
affects. This is a crucial moment within the process of affectivity, 
as it brings out that one does not necessarily adopt new affects 
as much as one reinterprets the meaning of the same affects. So 
through revaluing affects one comes to have a greater sense of 
the complexity of one's affective experience. This might be illus­
trated with a case in which one comes to understand how one's 
predisposition to experience an affect in a certain way extends 
from early interactions and experiences. Modulating the affect 
through revaluation would mean taking one's own experience 
and history into account. This is shown more specifically in the 
example of a patient (see "Rob," below) who revalues his experi­
ence of the ending of a relationship: he does so by coming to 
terms with how his parents' divorce influenced his experience, 
leading him to regard himself more as a victim rather than an 
agent in what transpired. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 439 
The third element of affectivity is the expression of affects. At 
the most rudimentary level; we can distinguish between the 
choice to restrain expression or to let it flow. Although one might 
readily presume that, expression means the outward manifesta­
tion of the affect in the world, this is not necessarily the case. In 
our view, it is important-not to ignore the sense in which affects 
can be expressed inwardly. Insofar as sociobiological accounts 
regard emotions as manifest in facial expression and as action 
responses that aid-survival,, it is legitimate to question what the 
idea of expressing one's affects inwardly could mean. Here we 
would emphasize that the concealment of emotional responses 
can be a useful and beneficial strategy for an organism. Express­
ing one's affects inwardly, then, can be understood as a strategy 
to resort to in a situation in which expressing one's affects 
outwardly is undesirable. The inward expression of affects is 
predicated upon the existence of a representational system'that 
gives us an option, other than outward expression. 
There are important implications for psychotherapy here. One 
might understand psychotherapy as experimenting with the in­
ward expression of affects through expressing them within an 
atmosphere that is contained and safe compared to the real 
world. As we have described in chapter 6—"Playing with Real­
ity"—psychotherapy can be understood as relying on a kind of 
pretend mode of functioning in which the therapist acts as a 
playful parent and thus serves to promote.fantasy and imagina­
tion in the way that a patient regulates his affects. Indeed, it is 
often an indication of progress in psychotherapy to observe that 
a patient has begun to express his affects inwardly. This entails 
no slight to value and importance of outward expression; the key 
matter is whether an agent .is able to make a choice that is 
genuinely in his self-interest. 
The inward expression of affects is especially consistent with 
self-reflexivity. Recall that as we have outlined the concept of 
mentalized affectivity, it entails reflecting on one's affects while 
one remains within an affective state, rather than from a posi­
tion of distance. In moving to express the affect, it can be 
sufficient to let one feel the affect anew without having it emerge 
in the world. For example, a patient realized how angry he was 
at his wife because she blamed him for her pregnancy, although 
h 

438 / Clinical Perspectives 
be more unusual, as in the patient who, whenever she becomes 
angry, quickly moves to explain it away by focusing sympathetic 
and even warm attention on the motivation of the agent who had 
caused her to be angry. Thus, beyond the task of naming affects, 
identifying affects can include the process of discerning the 
relation among distinct affects. 
In its basic form, modulating affects will mean that the affect 
is altered in some way. This can entail modifications in intensity 
or duration, or it can refer to more subtle adjustments, where 
the affect is refined. Modulation can mean that the affect is 
sustained as well as adjusted upward or downward. One of us 
has a highly narcissistic patient (see "Scott," below), who, just 
after hearing that a woman on whom he had a crush was getting 
engaged, announced that he was "feeling pretty good." Upon 
further exploration, he claimed not that he had not been sad 
about this news, but that his sadness had subsided. This seems 
like a case in which modulation might serve to sustain the affect 
in order for the patient to experience 'it fully, rather than either 
increase or decrease it. It is easy to imagine examples in which 
someone clings persistently to negative affects—let us say anger 
or resentment—in a way that colors too much of his experience. 
This would mean that modulation points to the value of adjust­
ing the negative affect downward. 
The complex form of affectivity concerns the revaluing of 
affects. This is a crucial moment within the process of affectivity, 
as it brings out that one does not necessarily adopt new affects 
as much as one reinterprets the meaning of the same affects. So 
through revaluing affects one comes to have a greater sense of 
the complexity of one's affective experience. This might be illus­
trated with a case in which one comes to understand how one's 
predisposition to experience an affect in a certain way extends 
from early interactions and experiences. Modulating the affect 
through revaluation would mean taking one's own experience 
and history into account. This is shown more specifically in the 
example of a patient (see "Rob," below) who revalues his experi­
ence of the ending of a relationship: he does so by coming to 
terms with how his parents' divorce influenced his experience, 
leading him to regard himself more as a victim rather than an 
agent in what transpired. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 439 
The third element of affectivity is the expression of affects. At 
the most rudimentary level; we can distinguish between the 
choice to restrain expression or to let it flow. Although one might 
readily presume that, expression means the outward manifesta­
tion of the affect in the world, this is not necessarily the case. In 
our view, it is important-not to ignore the sense in which affects 
can be expressed inwardly. Insofar as sociobiological accounts 
regard emotions as manifest in facial expression and as action 
responses that aid-survival,, it is legitimate to question what the 
idea of expressing one's affects inwardly could mean. Here we 
would emphasize that the concealment of emotional responses 
can be a useful and beneficial strategy for an organism. Express­

h 

440 / Clinical Perspectives 
he believed at the time that his wife was feeling too vulnerable 
to hear this from him. The point is that it was helpful for him 
to experience his anger at a deeper level than he had done, but 
it was equally important to confirm the choice not to convey 
his affect directly to his wife. We want to stress here how this 
account differs from one in which one recognizes one's anger 
from an intellectual standpoint. Mentalized affectivity goes fur­
ther in pushing us to own our affects; being able to express 
affects inwardly adds an option in situations where outward 
expression is not desirable. 
Expressing affects takes on greater complexity as a form of 
communication. Especially in those instances where the affect is 
expressed outwardly, we can distinguish between an expression 
that occurs without regard for others and one that occurs within 
the context of a dialogue with others. Communicating affects 
means that the expression is offered with the expectation of 
how it will be received by others. One wants the other person(s) 
not just to know what one feels, but also to understand and per­
haps respond to this feeling. For instance, a patient expressed 
annoyance at a break, inquiring whether he was right that last 
year's break had lasted for a shorter time. This goes beyond 
a statement of how the patient feels; it includes the expecta­
tion of a response. Thus, there is something more self-conscious 
about communicating affects that reflects an investment in in­
timate and social" relationships. We should recall here that 
the development of a communicative aspect of affects was 
stressed in chapter 4, "The Social Biofeedback Theory of Affect-
Mirroring." Aifect-mirroring is a basis for later communication in 
language. 
Although delineating the elements of mentalized affectivity 
gives us a better sense of what the concept involves, so far we 
still have remained at an abstract level. We have had some 
occasion to refer to case material; however, the value of men­
talized affectivity as a concept will be enriched considerably by 
an elaboration of its clinical, manifestations. In the next section 
we look at four different cases that highlight diverse aspects of 
such affectivity. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 441

fectivity (and the disastrous consequences of this) to a case in 
which affectivity has started to emerge within the treatment, and 
another case in which the patient came to the treatment 
with considerable affectivity. We also occasionally contend with 
affectivity as it pertains to the clinician. Any form of psycho­
therapy has, in our view, the aim of altering the patient's relation 
to his own affects, and affectivity represents this possibility. 
Even for those who possess affectivity, though, it is a continuing 
struggle.

She was not psychotic during the two-and-half years during 
which she was treated. She was disheveled and occasionally 
smelled badly (to the extent that the patient who followed her

not very responsive at first, and I often wondered how I could

There was, nonetheless, something likable about Teresa: she 
had a lively wit, and occasionally she would make comments 
about other therapists or patients at the clinic that were mean-
spirited but funny and devastatingly accurate. It interested me 
that she seemed to be able to observe others in a way that she 
could not observe herself. However, her observations of others 
never included positive affect and at times seemed to me to be 
based on misinterpretations, which led her to act in ways that 
had unfortunate consequences for her. During the course of 
working together I came to appreciate how her intuitions about 
others could be used in the treatment—serving as an affirmation 
of her interest in the human mind, even if it was not her own 
mind.2 
At first glance, it might seem strange to claim that a patient 
with strong borderline tendencies should be able to read others' 
minds, given the discussion of borderline personality disorder in 
chapter 9 ("The Roots of Borderline Personality Disorder in- Dis­
organized Attachment"), which stresses that underlying such 
pathology is precisely one of defective mindreading. However, we 
can distinguish between the capacity to be able to relate to and 
accept another as an other, which Teresa clearly lacked, and the 
fleeting, sometimes profoundly astute insights that borderlines 
like Teresa often exhibit. In using Teresa's comments on others

Teresa originally came to therapy because she was ordered to

away by the Bureau of Child Welfare (now ACS) for neglect and 
abuse—including a bizarre allegation that she had performed

possibly also sexually abused herself.

agitated afterward, denouncing him violently in our sessions— 
although she refused to tell me anything about the encounters. 
Teresa rarely spoke about her mother; she said that she did not 
like to see her mother because "all she does is nag me." When I 
inquired about what her mother would nag her about, she said: 
"and now you're going to nag me?" Teresa also had a sister with 
whom she had no contact. Her father had deserted the family 
when she was 9 years old. She did recall one incident shortly 
before her father left, when she was sitting at the kitchen table 
doing homework, and he came home drunk and responded to a 
question she asked him by smashing her in the head so hard 
that she fell out of the chair. Teresa grew edgy and defensive in 
narrating this incident and went on to claim boastfully that 
many other things happened to her, but they did not bother her 
or have any other effect on her. I gathered that from an early age 
Teresa had been on her own. 
The affect that was most prominent in our sessions was her 
rage. Primarily she raged against the court system—against the 
judges, lawyers (both the DAs and her own lawyers), and court 
officers—but also against the mental health system, including 
me as its representative. The sessions were repetitive and varied 
little in content. This atmosphere went on for a long time before I 
started to observe a change, not in the content of the sessions, 
but in that she started to miss fewer of them—from coming for 
two out of every four sessions to coming almost every week. 
One day she came in, freshly enraged by her encounter with a 
court-appointed psychiatrist as part on the ongoing evaluation of 
her suitability as the mother of her youngest daughter. She 
began by telling me that the psychiatrist was "all white, alright." 
When I asked her to elaborate, she said in a huff: "His hair was 
white, his coat was white, his eyebrows were white ... he was 
all white." She then told me about a revealing moment in their 
interaction. In the course of his interview, the psychiatrist posed 
the standard question: "Do you have thoughts of harming your­
self?" Teresa's response was: "No, but I have thoughts of harm­
ing you!" As' she narrated the story, I felt a rush of feelings—in 
which I was able to discern simultaneous feelings of starting to 
laugh and starting to cry.

444 / Clinical Perspectives 
Let me try to be as precise as possible about my internal 
reaction, as it felt unfamiliar and utterly strange. The feeling 
was distinct from experiencing a mixture of opposing things 
together—expressed, for example, in the notion of a "bittersweet 
feeling" or in the way that, in extreme circumstances, pleasure 
and pain can converge. There was something unalloyed and 
contradictory about what I felt, which; it is fair to suspect, might 
have been influenced by the patient's desire to rid herself of 
intolerable feelings and, therefore, embodied something of her 
unintegrated inner world. Having one's own psyche filled in this 
way from another exemplifies "projective identification." On re­
flection, I was able to analyze my experience as follows: I was 
laughing because of how brazen Teresa was and because I was 
amused by her (fleeting) sense of having triumphed over the 
psychiatrist. In a way, she had called his bluff: as he wanted to 
know how she felt, she was going to comply and tell him the 
unadorned truth. I was crying, of course, because in drawing 
attention to her own capacity for violence, she was dooming 
herself to be judged unfit as a mother. The psychiatrist, who met 
with her for an hour, judged her to be incompetent, and in his 
report he questioned whether she would ever be fit to be a 
mother. 
Teresa's behavior was hostile to the psychiatrist, and it is 
hardly consoling that her avowal of homicidal ideation might be 
construed as intending to answer the question about suicidal 
thoughts in the negative. Her behavior was blatantly self-de­
structive: it is hard to imagine her saying anything that would 
be as damaging to her own case. It is helpful to strive to look 
at things through Teresa's eyes. Teresa was a woman who was 
incredibly sensitive to slights and tended to misread the inten­
tions of others to her as malevolent: Thus, I would conjecture 
that she perceived the context—and, in particular, the psychia­
trist's query and, indeed, his very personhood—as an affront.

I would like to describe one other incident that occurred in 
Teresa's treatment. We had been meeting for almost two years 
when, one day, she came in and sat down. After a few minutes of 
silence, she said sharply: "Man, look at you! Don't you know 
anything . . . you're going to catch cold, if you walk around like 
that." (I realized that she was looking at my leg where, between 
the top of my socks and my trousers, about two inches of flesh 
was exposed.) She continued: "Now listen to me . . . if you catch 
cold, this is what you should do: you make yourself some tea; 
then you take a teaspoon of honey and lemon. You drink that, 
and you'll be all better." She shook her head, grinning and 
triumphant: "You ought to listen-to me. I know what I'm talking 
about." This little interaction was notable as it contains a rare 
instance of positive affect expressed by Teresa. Teresa meant 
well, regardless of something bossy and scolding about her 
tone and her quirky perception of reality, revealed in her loose 
associations. The affective quality to her language rendered 
the literal exchange of words to be less relevant. One could 
discern, I think, a wish on Teresa's part to express concern for 
my welfare. 
This interaction was moving because of her expression of 
empathy and care, suggesting that, after two years, she felt less 
oppositional and, perhaps, was offering a reciprocating gesture 
that she felt cared for by me. But the truth is that I did not often 
have the feeling that I was helping her. Very little of what I 
actually said seemed to matter; what did matter, I believe, was 
that I listened to her—being listened to, without being judged, 
was an experience conspicuously absent from her past history or 
present reality. (Notice the repetition of the word "listen" in the 
patient's expression of her concern for me.) 
From what I could tell, Teresa lived an extremely isolated life. 
Her best friend—the only friend she ever spoke about—a home­
less woman, who could usually be found in one of three or four 
locations, would' disappear for stretches of time. Thus, it was 
significant that she was able to form enough of a bond with me 
to move from coming halfheartedly and under duress to coming 
by choice. Her rage remained obdurate throughout the treat­
ment. Teresa felt wronged in a profound sense, and, in immers­
ing herself in fighting alone in the court system, managed to find

was exposed.) She continued: "Now listen to me . . . if you catch 
cold, this is what you should do: you make yourself some tea; 
then you take a teaspoon of honey and lemon. You drink that, 
and you'll be all better." She shook her head, grinning and 
triumphant: "You ought to listen-to me. I know what I'm talking 
about." This little interaction was notable as it contains a rare 
instance of positive affect expressed by Teresa. Teresa meant 
well, regardless of something bossy and scolding about her 
tone and her quirky perception of reality, revealed in her loose 
associations. The affective quality to her language rendered 
the literal exchange of words to be less relevant. One could 
discern, I think, a wish on Teresa's part to express concern for 
my welfare. 
This interaction was moving because of her expression of 
empathy and care, suggesting that, after two years, she felt less 
oppositional and, perhaps, was offering a reciprocating gesture 
that she felt cared for by me. But the truth is that I did not often 
have the feeling that I was helping her. Very little of what I 
actually said seemed to matter; what did matter, I believe, was 
that I listened to her—being listened to, without being judged, 
was an experience conspicuously absent from her past history or 
present reality. (Notice the repetition of the word "listen" in the 
patient's expression of her concern for me.) 
From what I could tell, Teresa lived an extremely isolated life. 
Her best friend—the only friend she ever spoke about—a home­
less woman, who could usually be found in one of three or four 
locations, would' disappear for stretches of time. Thus, it was 
significant that she was able to form enough of a bond with me 
to move from coming halfheartedly and under duress to coming 
by choice. Her rage remained obdurate throughout the treat­
ment. Teresa felt wronged in a profound sense, and, in immers­
ing herself in fighting alone in the court system, managed to find 

446 / Clinical Perspectives 
a willing conspirator in making her feel wrong—not necessarily 
without justice, but certainly without compassion. 
Instances of positive affect remained rare and too charged to 
be openly acknowledged. We had some touching moments, how­
ever, when she would make me laugh or smile, and while she 
would not overtly reveal it, I could tell that this pleased her and 
could even witness her attempt to suppress her own positive 
reaction. If I tried to draw attention to our shared pleasure, she 
would brutally reject it. The treatment ended abruptly after a 
problem with her Medicaid coverage and my subsequent depar­
ture from the clinic. Thus our work would remain incomplete. 
A year or so later, however, I saw Teresa on the street. She 
was preoccupied, looking through a garbage can* and did not 
look up. I wanted to greet her, but I also did not want to intrude; 
I decided that if she saw me, I would say hello. Quickly, the 
moment passed. As I walked away, I felt an overwhelming feeling 
of sadness. 
Discussion 
The range of affects that Teresa displayed was limited and repeti­
tive. Her rage was explosive, and at times, frightening.3 Her 
reaction to the court psychiatrist was disturbing because it 
revealed how seriously she misread the intentions of others. Her 
hostility here is best understood as an attempt to fend off what 
felt to her like hostility being directed at her. This is suggestive, 
perhaps, of traumatic reenactment as well as an eruption of 
primary process. 
Teresa showed little evidence of being able to identify or 
distinguish affects. Not surprisingly, this had Implications for 
3 Narcissistic rage, in Kohut's sense (Kohut 1972), is relevant here, as this 
patient's damaged self-esteem leaves her feeling vulnerable, requiring her to 
keep others at a distance and at times erupting with aggression. I describe an 
incident that occurred with Teresa, in which she got out of her chair and 
threatened to hit me, in my review article of John Steiner's Psychic Retreats 
(Jurist 1997). Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 447 
whether she was able to regulate her affects. Her rage flared up 
and automatically poured out; it loomed ominously in her psy­
chic functioning. Teresa must have felt tremendous fear in the 
situation of having to defend herself as a mother, yet her rage 
contaminated the experience of this or any other affects. Her 
rage seemed not so much like a hyperbolic form of anger, but a 
monolithic, domineering presence. 
As my experience of starting to laugh and cry together sug­
gests, Teresa's projective identification both masked and un­
veiled a confused, disorganized inner world. It provided a window 
into her fragmented sense of agency. Problems in her sense of 
agency emerged clearly in the episode with the court psychia­
trist: although her wish to be deemed a worthy mother was 
strong, her behavior ensured that she would be assessed as 
unworthy. 
The consequences of Teresa not being able to regulate her 
affects were dramatic. Her negative affects overwhelmed her. It is 
equally pertinent that even where she felt positive affect (to me), 
there was a tinge of some aggression as well. It did not feel safe 
for Teresa to feel positive affect; indeed, she worked at curtailing 
it, rather than risk expressing it. In this interaction with me, 
we can witness Teresa's struggle to be able to tolerate positive 
affect. 
One would be hard pressed to find evidence that Teresa 
possessed mentalized affectivity. Indeed, it is interesting how 
much I felt my own affect regulation to be undermined—for 
example, in my response to her story about the court psychia­
trist and especially in my response to meeting her on the street 
after the treatment had ended. Teresa was a difficult patient to 
whom one's own countertransference reactions were powerful; 
yet, these reactions provide one of the only clues to infer what 
she was experiencing. 
Teresa showed hints of developing a connection to her thera­
pist. This was a promising sign, in my opinion, of some potential 
to develop a measure of mentalized affectivity in a long-term, 
ongoing treatment. Whenever a patient exhibits a sense of 
humor, there is hope, and Teresa had a delightful if wicked 
sense of humor. Without mentalized affectivity, Teresa is bound

"BENNIE" 
Bennie is a Jewish man in his early fifties. He grew up in a 
working-class family just outside New York. He was an excellent 
student and won a scholarship to attend an elite university, 
where he majored in history. Bennie fell apart during his junior 
year and has never recovered the same level of functioning. He 
once showed me his college transcript, which provides dramatic 
evidence of the manifestation of his illness: during his freshman 
year, he received grades of Bs mostly and a few Cs; during his 
sophomore year, he received mostly Bs again, with one A and 
one C; during the Fall semester of his junior year, he failed every 
course. He made a few attempts to enroll again before dropping 
out permanently. 
Bennie's decompensation is consistent with the classic symp­
toms of schizophrenia. Over the years, he has had numerous 
breakdowns and hospitalizations. He spent almost a decade 
living on the streets and in SRO's (single rooms), refusing medi­
cation and relishing his choice to live within a delusional world. 
Bennie can be extremely articulate about this time of his life, as 
when he describes his identification with Native Americans, 
which led him to wander through Riverside Park "on a sacred 
quest for meaning," immersing himself in observing tiny details 
of plant and animal life, indifferent only, he is aware, to the 
presence of other human beings. Bennie recalls this time as a 
period when he was fully alive, and he becomes defensive in the 
face of being reminded of his suffering—for example, occasions 
when he was beaten up on the streets. 
About eleven years ago, Bennie moved into a social service 
hotel. He has a social worker there, and he also attends a 
vocational group once a week. He has had several psychologists 
over the years, whom, for the most part, he remembers fondly. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 449 
He has seen numerous psychiatrists whom he recalls more 
ambivalently. He likes his current psychiatrist very much and 
sees her once a month. He is diligent about taking his medica­
tion for his current diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. About 
ten years ago, he had to be brought to the emergency room 
because he was screaming "kill the Jews, kill the Jews" while 
thinking about his father in his room; he was released the 
following day. 
I have been seeing Bennie twice a week for the last nine years. 
He never misses his appointments, and he takes psychotherapy 
seriously—often bringing in a list of topics he wants to talk 
about. We have a good working relationship. He is no longer 
actively delusional, although he does have peculiar compulsive 
habits—like finding himself eating in restaurants in rhythm with 
conversations at other tables, or like watching his clock until 
6:05 because "605" was the street address of the house where he 
grew up. Bennie frequently has ideas of reference; interestingly, 
when we work together on examining these, he can distinguish 
among their plausibility and will jokingly rate them in percent­
age to their relation to reality—usually with a fair degree of 
accuracy. Humor has emerged to be a crucial component in my 
work with Bennie. It is a way for him to tolerate shared moments 
without feeling threatened. Moments of humor stand in lieu of, 
but might be seen as a promise for, a more abiding sense of 
closeness to others. 
Bennie's daily life is uneventful. He works two mornings a 
week as an English-language tutor. He hangs out in the lobby of 
his building. He has a favorite restaurant in his neighborhood, 
where he eats almost all his meals; he has some social contact 
with other tenants in his building, and he also has a few college 
friends with whom he keeps up. His parents have moved far

will imagine someone looking at him on the bus and then invent 
tales of who the person is and what he/she thinks of him. 
Bennie tends to keep his distance from others; yet, he is also

mental-health workers on whom he relies to sustain him. He is 
both afraid of real contact with others and craves it. 
Occasionally, Bennie is able to be deeply in touch with his 
unconscious life through his dreams. He has narrated dreams 
that last for 25 minutes, leaving me overwhelmed and confused 
by the sheer intensity of the imagery. He tends to be more 
interested in narrating the dreams than he is in interpreting 
them. He does have a rare capacity to be in touch with psychotic 
parts of himself and to bring them into the treatment. 
It is difficult to know to what extent Bennie's reports about 
his relationship to his parents and his early life in general are 
reliable. He regards his mother as intrusive and domineering, 
and his father, who died at 89 years of age after many years of 
incapacitating illness, as unresponsive and occasionally cold 
and even hostile. In phone calls prior to his father's death, 
Bennie was disturbed by his father's response to. him and had 
seemingly little appreciation for the extent of his father's infir­

journey to be with his family a few weeks after that. His reac­
tions to his father's death have mostly featured his disappoint­
ment with his father, and he has only expressed overt grief on 
one occasion. Bennie is fragile and has strong guilt feelings 
about being a disappointment to his parents, so I have not 
pushed him to deal with this loss. 
Bennie understands that he must be vigilant about not allow­
ing himself to act on the basis of his thoughts. Sometimes he 
becomes grave and still, pondering his mind, which regularly 
manufactures false or at least unreliable beliefs. Although I have 
confidence that he can identify signs of becoming actively psy­
chotic and that we might have a chance to intervene to stop 
further decompensation, it is harder to know what constitutes 
success in the treatment. Many mental-health professionals 
would scoff at the notion of a successful outcome for a schizo-Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 451 
phrenic in psychotherapy. Other mental-health professionals 
would be inclined to emphasize that staying the course and 
monitoring Bennie from getting worse is itself a positive outcome 
and not to be minimized. Indeed, Bennie's positive symptoms 
have been well-controlled by the combination of psychotherapy 
and psychopharmacology, although his negative symptoms—not 
getting out of bed, not keeping himself and his room clean, not 
finishing projects he begins—remain a problem. I have been 
struck by Bennie's need for self-understanding, and this has 
been a guiding light throughout the treatment. 
Bennie continues to battle his devastating illness. A measure 
of his success can be marked by his current work as a tutor in 
reading at a public library, for which he has received heartfelt 
thanks from a number of his students. Yet, Bennie's well-being 
has its vicissitudes, and he seems to be sitting on a well of 
sadness. Like most other people, he benefits from exploration of 
his personal history and dynamics. In his case, though, the 
project of self-understanding must contend with the enormous 
power and force of his disorder. 
Discussion 
Bennie is a patient who has a serious mental illness. The illness 
interferes with his perception of reality, and, thus, Bennie's 
reading of the intentions of others can often be dangerously 
mistaken. In particular, Bennie can be quite paranoid in the 
way he construes what appear to be innocuous interactions. 
With such a patient, it is not possible to expect a high degree of 
affectivity. 
Bennie does exhibit a range of affects. He is able to identify 
affects like fear, sadness, and anger. Moreover, he is able to 
identify, distinguish, and express positive affects as well. Bennie 
has activities that he enjoys, like listening to music and drawing. 
He can be warm and concerned for others—he notices and 
expresses sympathy if I have a cold, and he dotes on his 3-year-
old nephew. He has intervened to get help for others in the social 
services building in which he lives. Yet, it is difficult for him to 
sustain positive affects in relationships.

452 / Clinical Perspectives 
Although Bennie has a range of affects, he has difficulty 
modulating them. Let me offer an example: during a visit with 
his nephew at a restaurant, he was pleased to engage in a game 
of hide and seek using a menu, but when the nephew fell asleep 
shortly thereafter, Bennie's interpretation was that it must have 
been because he was bored with Bennie's company. His anxiety 
about being disregarded is played out with a young child— 
without any appreciation that the child's sleepiness might have 
an independent cause. When I tried to draw attention to other 
possible interpretations of the nephew's behavior, Bennie could 
appreciate that he was jumping to a conclusion. Yet, it is clear 
that he would not have come to this point by himself. 
What about Bennie's reaction to a major life experience, such 
as his father's death? It does not appear that he is passing 
through some of the common, expected stages of grief. In one 
sense, he uncompromisingly refuses to revise or minimize the 
extent of his negative feelings about his father. Yet, there is some 
kind of failure in regulation that is revealed in how he thinks 
about his father—as well as his widowed mother. Bennie is at a 
loss about what to do about his father's death. He reports having 
moments where something about his father flashes through his 
mind, but he is not inclined to use this as a basis of reflection 
about what his father meant to him. 
Bennie feels a deep, deep sadness about the trajectory of his 
life. He is aware of having a mind that does not work right. At 
this point in his life, he is remarkably adept at remaining free of 
trouble. I try to be with him in his moments of sadness without 
unrealistically raising expectations of a better tomorrow. The 
work that we do together has implications for mentalized affec­
tivity. In reviewing his ideas of reference, Bennie can sometimes 
distance himself from some of his assumptions that he is in­
clined to make by himself. This often leads him to distinguish his 
affects better and to be able to modulate them. It is significant 
that this does not happen when Bennie is alone. However, he 
would have resisted such a mutual effort during the first five to 
six years of the treatment. 
In conclusion, I would like to return to Bennie's sense of 
humor. When he laughs, it sounds like the clanking of a rusty Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 453 
machine. Bennie can tolerate mutual positive affect through 
humor. As I have already suggested, humor serves to join us in 
intimate moments and as a fleeting marker of greater satisfac­
tion. Bennie feels closer to me than to anyone else in his life. 
Indeed, it is not all inadvertent that Bennie's closest relation­
ships are with mental-health professionals; relations with others 
have been much more conflicted and confusing. Our work to­
gether enables Bennie to experience genuine moments of con­
nection and to sustain his commitment to finding a meaningful 
life for himself. With some help, Bennie has moments in which 
he exhibits the capacity to reflect on his affects. Although it is 
perhaps idealistic to hope that he might attain mentalized affec­
tivity more fully, the battle to seek it is surely worth fighting.

started to truant and to drink and do drugs. In his early twen­
ties, he moved to New Mexico to become a painter and to work in 
an art gallery. At this time, he drank and smoked heavily and did 
lots of drugs. Scott was married for three years, neglecting his 
wife until eventually she left him to return to her parents' home. 
Scott had many casual relationships and a few more serious 
ones during these years. As his life in the fast lane became 
increasingly self-destructive, Scott turned to therapy for help. He 
spent three years in therapy at that time, which helped him 
to stop abusing substances and led to his decision to move to 
New York. 
Scott has little contact with his family. He has not seen his 
parents in seven years; he receives letters from his mother a few 
times a year, including Christmas. His father, a fairly successful 
businessman, was tough and bullying and disdained his son's 
artistic leanings. He himself had not gone to college, and he 

452 / Clinical Perspectives 
Although Bennie has a range of affects, he has difficulty 
modulating them. Let me offer an example: during a visit with 
his nephew at a restaurant, he was pleased to engage in a game 
of hide and seek using a menu, but when the nephew fell asleep 
shortly thereafter, Bennie's interpretation was that it must have 
been because he was bored with Bennie's company. His anxiety 
about being disregarded is played out with a young child— 
without any appreciation that the child's sleepiness might have 
an independent cause. When I tried to draw attention to other 
possible interpretations of the nephew's behavior, Bennie could 
appreciate that he was jumping to a conclusion. Yet, it is clear 
that he would not have come to this point by himself. 
What about Bennie's reaction to a major life experience, such 
as his father's death? It does not appear that he is passing 
through some of the common, expected stages of grief. In one 
sense, he uncompromisingly refuses to revise or minimize the 
extent of his negative feelings about his father. Yet, there is some 
kind of failure in regulation that is revealed in how he thinks 
about his father—as well as his widowed mother. Bennie is at a 
loss about what to do about his father's death. He reports having 
moments where something about his father flashes through his 
mind, but he is not inclined to use this as a basis of reflection 
about what his father meant to him. 
Bennie feels a deep, deep sadness about the trajectory of his 
life. He is aware of having a mind that does not work right. At 
this point in his life, he is remarkably adept at remaining free of 
trouble. I try to be with him in his moments of sadness without 
unrealistically raising expectations of a better tomorrow. The 
work that we do together has implications for mentalized affec­
tivity. In reviewing his ideas of reference, Bennie can sometimes 
distance himself from some of his assumptions that he is in­
clined to make by himself. This often leads him to distinguish his 
affects better and to be able to modulate them. It is significant 
that this does not happen when Bennie is alone. However, he 
would have resisted such a mutual effort during the first five to 
six years of the treatment. 
In conclusion, I would like to return to Bennie's sense of 
humor. When he laughs, it sounds like the clanking of a rusty Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 453 
machine. Bennie can tolerate mutual positive affect through 
humor. As I have already suggested, humor serves to join us in 
intimate moments and as a fleeting marker of greater satisfac­
tion. Bennie feels closer to me than to anyone else in his life. 
Indeed, it is not all inadvertent that Bennie's closest relation­
ships are with mental-health professionals; relations with others 
have been much more conflicted and confusing. Our work to­
gether enables Bennie to experience genuine moments of con­
nection and to sustain his commitment to finding a meaningful 
life for himself. With some help, Bennie has moments in which 
he exhibits the capacity to reflect on his affects. Although it is 
perhaps idealistic to hope that he might attain mentalized affec­
tivity more fully, the battle to seek it is surely worth fighting. 
"SCOTT" 
Scott is a 40-year-old man who was raised in a middle-class 
family and grew up in various places in the Midwest and in 
Arizona. His early life was characterized by numerous moves, 
which left him with few friends and lonely. In high school, he 
started to truant and to drink and do drugs. In his early twen­
ties, he moved to New Mexico to become a painter and to work in 
an art gallery. At this time, he drank and smoked heavily and did 
lots of drugs. Scott was married for three years, neglecting his 
wife until eventually she left him to return to her parents' home. 
Scott had many casual relationships and a few more serious 
ones during these years. As his life in the fast lane became 
increasingly self-destructive, Scott turned to therapy for help. He 
spent three years in therapy at that time, which helped him 
to stop abusing substances and led to his decision to move to 
New York. 
Scott has little contact with his family. He has not seen his 
parents in seven years; he receives letters from his mother a few 
times a year, including Christmas. His father, a fairly successful 
businessman, was tough and bullying and disdained his son's 
artistic leanings. He himself had not gone to college, and he 

53SF 
454 / Clinical Perspectives 
thought it was a waste of time for others. Scott describes his 
mother in generic terms: as a typical 1950s' housewife, passive 
and conventional. Scott has a younger sister, who is gay and 
who has been in a committed relationship for many years; Scott 
has not seen his sister in four years. 
Scott was particularly close to his paternal grandmother. 
When he was 6 years old, he was sent to live with her for two 
years—ostensively because the air in Arizona would be better for 
his health. (He had a respiratory problem of unknown severity.) 
Scott now suspects, however, that he might have been sent away 
because his mother felt overwhelmed with dealing with him. This 
insight is based upon some key memories where Scott recalls 
beseeching her to play with him as she ironed or cleaned, and 
she reacted by getting fed up, fleeing to the bedroom, and shut­
ting the door behind her. 
Although Scott felt loved by his grandmother, he had a dawn­
ing awareness that she was disturbed. He came to see that she 
was unreliable as a storyteller, making up that she owned prop­
erty that he would inherit and that she was friendly with famous 
people whom they saw on television. She used multiple names, 
which, Scott later ascertained, had to do with the fact that she 
had been married six times. She also tried to influence Scott 
against his mother. Later in life, she traveled around for years, 
staying with acquaintances all over the country without having 
her own home. This grandmother died alienated from Scott as 
well as from Scott's parents. 
Scott had some success in the art world in New Mexico, but 
he also had some failures, and in his mid-thirties he decided 
that what he really wanted to do was to get an education. At the 
time he entered treatment with me, he had attempted to attend 
college numerous times without having completed a semester. 
Scott has been in treatment for five years; During that time, 
he has won two scholarships and several awards, and he has 
spent a year abroad. He has also returned to painting. Interest­
ingly, he formed a relationship with a woman while he was away. 
When he returned to treatment after the year abroad, he rejected 
the possibility of trying to remain in a long-distance relationship. 
Scott has ambitious career plans, including organizing an art 
exhibition at a major museum. At the same time, he has had to Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 455 
struggle not to allow incompletes to mount up—jeopardizing his 
achievement. In the context of discussing this situation, he told 
the following story: he had turned in a paper for an English class 
to complete a course, which was an accomplishment and also a 
great relief. The following week he was reading in the library, and 
he became aware of someone walking by him, and he heard a 
voice. He looked up to see that it was his English professor, who 
was talking to him, telling him that the paper was excellent and 
that he had enjoyed reading it. Scott realized that he did not 
comprehend what was said until later, and he was unable to 
respond directly, mumbling something that was incoherent. 
As Scott sat and thought about the incident, he became 
aware that, at the moment he perceived that the person near 
him was his professor, he was anticipating criticism—that he 
would be told that the paper was terrible and that the professor 
was disappointed in his efforts. His sense of confusion during 
the interaction was produced, according to Scott, by the conflict 
between the imagined voice in his head and the real external 
voice. He averred that this conflict had to do with difficulty in 
believing in his own success—even though he had worked hard 
and deserved it. Moreover, the internal voice reminded him of his 
domineering father, who never believed in his success and who 
derided his interest in education. It is interesting how the profes­
sor's praise manages to be blocked, in effect preventing an 
experience of positive affect. As Scott reflected about the incident 
after it had occurred and before talking about it in therapy, he 
was consumed with worry that he had insulted the professor by 
not responding appropriately; he also felt vaguely upset at him­
self. In our session, Scott was able to allow himself gratification 
with some prompting and to express pride that his work was 
praised. 
This incident shows Scott's internal world prohibiting the 
experience of positive affect—the intermingling between (imag­
ined) negative affect and (actual) positive affect paralyzed him. 
Scott was also able to make sense of some of his emotions. Still, 
when he is by himself, he stays with feeling bad. With help in the 
session, he moves to amend this, resulting in some regret about 
what happened but primarily a sense that he ought to feel good.

The patient's tendency toward negative affect is entrenched 

456 / Clinical Perspectives 
enough to prevent him from having positive affect at first, but 
not so entrenched that it must be excluded at all cost. The 
interaction, which he reports as a kind of bystander to himself, 
is altered so that he understands the incident and then re-
experiences it. 
There has been an interesting change in Scott's relationship 
to his own affects over the course of the therapy. At the begin­
ning of the treatment, it was as striking as it was perplexing 
that he would omit reports of feelings and at times mislabel his 
feelings—like the opening moment of a session (already men­
tioned in the section on The Elements of Mentalized Affectivity" 
in this chapter), after he had just learned that a woman on 
whom he had a crush for several months was getting engaged, 
when he announced: "I've been feeling pretty good. . . ." Al­
though it is helpful to aid Scott in identifying his feelings, being 
too direct in doing so can actually backfire. 
A few years into the treatment, Scott continues to struggle to 
be able to experience his own affects. For instance, he returned 
from an appointment with a doctor who, after a number of tests, 
told him that a chronic urological problem he has is due to a 
congenital problem with his kidney. Scott was told that he might 
require surgery—with two options: a more serious operation or 
a newer, less painful, but also more uncertain high-tech pro­
cedure. I asked Scott what he thought about the situation. He 
responded: "Well, I don't feel too worried. ... I mean, I hope that 
I won't end up having kidney failure. I would hate to have to go to 
dialysis, which is time-consuming and would get in the way of 
my work." 
Despite the ostensive denial of feeling worried, Scott went on 
to make it fairly evident by jumping to a worst-case scenario— 
that, naturally, he was quite concerned. From experience I was 
aware that Scott's impulse not to acknowledge what he feels 
could have the undesirable effect of rendering his feelings more 
extreme. However, I was also concerned that too active an inter­
pretation about his affect state might make him defensive and 
disputatious. Scott had something at stake in talking about his 
affect state without specifying it—as if to ward off falling into the 
state without hope of getting out of it. With some help, though, Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 457 
he was able to move in this direction—that is, to feel appropri­
ately worried, mindful of both his personal history and the 
immediate circumstances. 
Scott and I have had success in working on his relation to his 
affects, particularly through his interest in art. Art serves the 
complex function of allowing him to distance himself from and at 
the same time to process his affects. There is one painting in 
which he has developed a strong interest, which depicts a scene 
from Homer's Odyssey. The context is Odysseus' famous en­
counter with the Cyclops, Polyphemos, who savagely gobbles up 
a few of Odysseus' men. The scene reveals Odysseus at his best 
and worst: he restrains himself from acting, devising a resource­
ful way to save his men and himself, but then he jeopardizes all 
of their survival by indulging in his omnipotence. He devises the 
resourceful plan of getting Polyphemos drunk and then blinding 
him with a huge, sharpened pole. This enables Odysseus and his 
men to crawl out of Polyphemos' cave by tying themselves to the 
underbelly of sheep; when the blinded Cyclops searches for 
them, touching the backs of the sheep, they escape undetected. 
After they have successfully escaped and are about to depart, 
however, Odysseus yells out to Polyphemos, taunting him that 
his name is "Nobody." This provokes Polyphemos into tossing a 
massive boulder, which comes close to shipwrecking the boat 
and dooming their survival. The painting that Scott is working 
on represents the precise moment when Odysseus boasts to the 
Cyclops. 
Our interpretation of the painting has been ongoing and from 
multiple angles. First of all, Scott's father, whom he experienced 
as bullying and uncivilized, resembles the dangerous Cyclops. 
This resemblance was confirmed through a quite extraordinary 
fact that came out in interpreting Scott's relationship to the 
painting: like the one-eyed Cyclops, Scott's father is blind in one 
eye—having suffered an accident as a young man. The oedipal 
theme is prominent, as Scott identifies with Odysseus who as­
serts himself with phallic aggression against Polyphemos. The 
blinding of Polyphemos, like Oedipus's self-blinding, is a kind of 
symbolic castration. However, we have also pondered the impor­
tance of the (pre-oedipal) theme of omnipotence suggested by the

painting.4 The painting resonates with Scott, we discovered to­

associates with strong affect. 
Through the external representation of art, Scott has found a 
way to observe his inner conflicts. Indeed, it is hard to imagine 
that he would be able to deal with these issues as comfortably 
without this distance. It is interesting that his intellectuality 
provides a means for him to be in touch with deep emotional 
issues. Scott has articulated the insight that he might have 
learned that it is better not to feel, since feeling is linked to 
aggression that gets out of control. It is rather interesting that 
Odysseus acts uncharacteristically here: he is usually depicted 
as someone who gets what he wants through restraint and 
adhering to a course of moderation. Ironically enough, then, we 
might conclude that the painting provides not merely a diagno­
sis, but the path for a cure for Scott. 
Discussion 
The absence of affect was a notable part of the early phases of 
Scott's therapy.5 Not only did he omit affects where one would 
expect them, but often he did not describe them as part of his 
experience at all. At times, he would seem to mislabel his feel­
ings. Not surprisingly, he had very little overt response in his 
transference to me. I recall that Scott would pause to hear me 
speak and then continue as if it were merely an interruption 
of his own line of thinking. This changed, particularly during 
breaks for vacations, when Scott reported physical illnesses that 
4 The oscillation of narcissistic self-esteem is conveyed in the contrast of 
extremes between "Polyphemos." which means "much-famed" in Greek, and 
"Nobody," the false name Odysseus gives to himself (the Greek word "Oudos" 
here is a play on Odysseus* real name). In the treatment, Scott's narcissism 
came up in the context of his reading and his awareness of his own narcissistic 
tendencies. 
5 Scott reminded me of the alexithymic patients whom Krystal (1988) de­
scribes who often abuse substances as a way of distancing themselves from 
painful affects. Also, like the patients Krystal describes, Scott would report one-
sentence dreams—without any ability to provide associations. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 459 
we could understand in terms of the treatment as protection 
against pain. 
It was quite important that the treatment resumed after 
Scott's year abroad: he became more vulnerable, manifested in a 
new interest in examining the past—like when he had been sent 
away and then returned home to his family. Although Scott still 
did not openly display his affects, I could observe a shift—which 
can be conveyed in the difference between his posture of "I've 
been feeling pretty good" in the face of a narcissistic rejection 
and an implicit recognition of his sadness of the narcissistic 
rejection in feeling alone and confused after being sent away 
from home at the age of 6 years. 
Scott has trouble identifying his affects, but he is growing to 
be more interested in making sense of his affective experience. 
Given his difficulty in identifying and distinguishing affects, it is 
predictable that he also struggles with regulating them. This is 
nicely illustrated in Scott's reaction to his kidney disorder, where 
he is estranged from his anxieties and takes them in an extreme 
direction— before modulating them with the help of my input. 
We also see that Scott is more comfortable exploring his affects 
with the distance that aesthetic objects provide. 
There also has been evolution in the transference. He regis­
ters what I say to a greater degree. The value of therapy for him 
is conveyed in the way he divides his life into a before and an 
after. Scott does not express positive affect about therapy or me; 
this is consistent with someone who would need to block positive 
affect, as he does in the incident with his English professor. Not 
only has he never asked me a question about myself, he has 
shown very few signs of having such curiosity. Yet, Scott is now 
able to express negative transference reactions to me—like being 
bothered by interruptions with vacations and occasionally being 
annoyed by something I've said". 
Scott is now clearly more alive in the way he lives. After many 
years of living precariously—with periods of being down and 
out—he has had some genuine success. His education repre­
sents a triumph over the discouragement he received at home. It 
is still difficult for him to accept what he feels inside himself. Yet, 
mentalized affectivity has emerged within the course of therapy. 
With some help, Scott is able to reflect upon the incident with

from home at the age of 6 years. 
Scott has trouble identifying his affects, but he is growing to 
be more interested in making sense of his affective experience. 
Given his difficulty in identifying and distinguishing affects, it is 
predictable that he also struggles with regulating them. This is 
nicely illustrated in Scott's reaction to his kidney disorder, where 
he is estranged from his anxieties and takes them in an extreme 
direction— before modulating them with the help of my input. 
We also see that Scott is more comfortable exploring his affects 
with the distance that aesthetic objects provide. 
There also has been evolution in the transference. He regis­
ters what I say to a greater degree. The value of therapy for him 
is conveyed in the way he divides his life into a before and an 
after. Scott does not express positive affect about therapy or me; 
this is consistent with someone who would need to block positive 
affect, as he does in the incident with his English professor. Not 
only has he never asked me a question about myself, he has 
shown very few signs of having such curiosity. Yet, Scott is now 
able to express negative transference reactions to me—like being 
bothered by interruptions with vacations and occasionally being 
annoyed by something I've said". 
Scott is now clearly more alive in the way he lives. After many 
years of living precariously—with periods of being down and 
out—he has had some genuine success. His education repre­
sents a triumph over the discouragement he received at home. It 
is still difficult for him to accept what he feels inside himself. Yet, 
mentalized affectivity has emerged within the course of therapy. 
With some help, Scott is able to reflect upon the incident with 

jr 
460 / Clinical Perspectives 
the English professor, moving from focusing on his fear of having 
insulted the professor to pondering his own need to interfere 
with a pleasurable experience. Something similar occurs with 
Scott's reflection about his kidney disorder. Although these in­
stances of affectivity occur in sessions, he is doing more of the 
work by himself. 
A promising example of Scott's emergent affectivity can be 
seen in his choice not to engage in fruitless confrontations 
during the course of his daily life. The first few years of therapy 
were filled with such antagonistic encounters with others. I 
recall that in our very first session he described an unpleasant 
encounter with a security guard, who was talking on the tele­
phone instead of doing his job—checking the bags of students 
exiting the library. Scott made an audible comment about his 
resentment at having to wait around; the result, of course, was 
that the security guard took his time, they exchanged angry 
words, and he ended up being delayed still further. Let us 
compare this to a recent incident: Scott was crossing the street 
as a taxi was letting a passenger off, blocking his way. He tossed 
the driver a dirty look, which prompted the driver to get out of 
his taxi and start yelling at Scott. Scott had an impulse to return 
fire with fire, but he decided it was not worth the effort and 
walked away. 
Although Scott is still responsible for initiating the conflict in 
the second incident, he restrains himself from exacerbating it. 
Moreover, we can see this as a moment in which initially Scott 
displays his feeling of disgust at the driver outwardly; then he 
shifts and makes the choice to express his affects internally. In 
Scott's narration of this incident, he was aware that he remained 
upset at that moment, but he felt good about having opted to act 
in accordance with a deeper sense of his own purpose. Here 
Scott displays mentalized affectivity in precisely the manner that 
the Odyssey entertains in the scene of Odysseus deriding Poly­
phemos. Like Odysseus, whom Homer describes as "polytropos" 
(he is, literally, the man of "many ways"), Scott has options 
about how he will respond. Reflecting upon readings of the 
Odyssey has made Scott aware of the danger he associates with 
the expression of affects. His fascination with the Odyssey, Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 461 
which I happen to share, has been a meeting place in our 
relationship. Although Scott does not exteriorize his transfer­
ence to me, my responsiveness to interpreting a work of great 
emotional import has helped him to feel more secure and begin 
to thrive. The change in his affectivity that we glimpse over time 
is central to his therapeutic progress. 
"ROB" 
Rob is a bright and sensitive young man in his mid-twenties who 
grew up in a Wasp (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) family from 
the South. His family was close when he was young. Rob got 
along with his younger sister, even though she is extroverted 
and he is introverted. Rob has always been particularly close to 
his mother: he remembers coming home from school and sitting 
down with her as she attentively listened to him describe his day 
while he enjoyed milk and cookies. 
Rob began therapy because he was depressed after splitting 
up with his girl friend of five years. Their relationship had 
started during his freshman year in college—the same year, it 
turns out, that his parents announced that they were getting 
divorced. His parents informed him of this by flying out together 
to visit him and discussing their decision. Rob had had no idea 
that his parents were having trouble. The family dynamic mixed 
sensitive parenting with a strong undercurrent of suppressing 
all conflict. 
At first, Rob was somewhat resistant to my suggestion that he 
might be reexperiencing the pain of his parents' divorce through 
the current breakup with his girl friend. But as he gained more 
distance from the end of the relationship and formed a connec­
tion to me, he began to realize that he had avoided dealing with 
his reactions to his parents* divorce. More specifically, Rob re­
called how in college he threw himself into activity—his work, 
politics, and sports. He had not had much experience with 
women up to that point, but he soon commenced his first seri­
ous relationship (with the woman with whom he broke up just

ous relationship (with the woman with whom he broke up just 

"^ P" 
462 / Clinical Perspectives 
before entering treatment). A couple of years into the treatment, 
Rob started to become interested in how his depression at the 
end of a relationship reactivated older feelings about his parents' 
divorce. Not only could he see that he had* much stronger feel­
ings about the divorce than he realized at the time, but he came 
to be in touch with his anger with his father, whom he saw as 
the one responsible for breaking up the family. 
As his involvement in therapy deepened, Rob and I explored 
new and different angles of his past. His understanding of what 
had happened in the relationship underwent a shift: he began to 
see the outcome less as a matter of his girl friend leaving him, 
and more as a matter of their interests diverging and the inher­
ent difficulty of sustaining a relationship that began in college. 
Rob was able to acknowledge aspects of his own dissatisfaction 
in the relationship. He also became aware of some differences 
between his parents' divorce, which occurred without warning 
and without his input, and the breakup of the relationship, 
which, at least to some degree, reflected his own choice. Rob 
developed a complex interpretation here, starting from his flight 
into a relationship in the face of his parents' divorce, which 
enabled him not to feel hopeless about relationships and to be a 
little less involved with his family in the aftermath of his parents' 
divorce but also served to distance him from the range of feelings 
he had about it. Rob gave voice, too, to the frustratingly symbi­
otic quality of this relationship. Finally, he had insights about 
how the divorce, while looming largely in his late-adolescent 
experience, itself reenacted much earlier developmental issues. 
The divorce had an aspect of being an oedipal victory for him, 
since he had always been close to his mother and she turned to 
him more during and after the divorce, and also because it 
brought heightened conflict with his father. Yet, the divorce 
evoked intense anxiety because Rob felt that he was prematurely 
on his own and would have to fend for himself with less support. 
There was and there remains real sadness about the breakup 
of his family: Rob wept in a session as he realized that leaving 
home for him coincided with there being no more home left. Over 
the next year, Rob moved from feeling despair about relation­
ships and from isolating himself to being sad from time to time, Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 463 
but ready to move ahead in his life. He became involved in a new 
relationship. Our work has focused more on his tendency to drift 
into how he thinks he should feel rather than staying with how 
he really feels. 
Since the divorce, Rob's mother has not become involved in a 
new relationship, and she remains very much involved in her 
children's lives. Rob's father remarried a few years ago with a 
younger woman; his father has made an effort to maintain a 
relationship with him, but Rob feels that it is perfunctory. Rob 
does not like his stepmother and resents that she controls his 
father, although he is also critical of his father for allowing her to 
do so. 
During a family gathering, which concluded a long weekend 
together, Rob's father made an announcement in front of Rob 
and his younger sister (as well as their grandmother and some 
cousins) that startled Rob: his wife and he planned to adopt a 
baby. Rob was aware that they were contemplating having a 
child, but figured the matter had been resolved when his step­
mother did not get pregnant. Rob had a negative reaction to the 
way the issue of adopting a child was raised—just at the conclu­
sion of the gathering, as if to ensure that there would be no 
discussion, making him feel doubly left out. In therapy, we 
focused on the possibility of Rob disclosing his feelings to his 
father. He wrote his father a letter; his father answered promptly 
with an email—not responding to what Rob said, but affirming 
the value of talking and openly exchanging their opinions. 
No heart-to-heart talk ensued. Rob felt that his father was 
obliged to be the one to follow up. Neither Rob nor his father 
made the time to initiate a serious conversation on the next 
occasion when they got together. Rob began to think that per­
haps they had cooled to the idea of adoption, but several months 
later he received a phone call from his father, explaining that, on 
short notice, they were leaving to pick up a baby girl to adopt. 
Rob felt angry and betrayed. He understands that part of his 
reaction is irrational: that at some level he knew this might 
happen, that his father is perfectly entitled to choose to have a 
new family, and that this need not exclude him. The inception of 
this new family, however, has meant that Rob is facing anew the

demise of his old family. Rob acknowledged his anxiety of both 
being rejected by his father and being left with his mother. 
This experience repeated elements of his parents' divorce: 
that the announcement was precipitous and especially that his 
father voiced the right sentiments, but failed to follow through. 
Rob's negative reaction to his father was exacerbated shortly 
thereafter when his father phoned after the baby was at home 
but did not have time to talk, and mentioned in an off-hand way 
that he had thought Rob would not be at home, and he had 
planned to leave a message. The situation is actually even more 
complicated by the fact that Rob's mother has made no effort to 
conceal her resentments about her former husband from Rob or 
his sister. 
Rob has had moments of sadness in therapy about this 
situation, but he has also muted his emotional reaction and 
initially withheld the extent of his true feelings. A week or so 
after finding out about the adoption, Rob left for a (scheduled) 
vacation. His girl friend was not able to go with him, so he 
planned to go away by himself—a first for him. The trip itself 
went fine, but on the way home, he suffered from a phobic 
reaction while flying. He was anxious and distracted during the 
two takeoffs, ruminating about what could go wrong. It was 
crucial, according to his report of what he was feeling at the 
time, that his fate was completely out of his hands. 
Rob had had a flying phobia before, although this time was 
worse. We had been successful in reducing his fear of flying, 
especially after linking his fear to his freshman year in college, 
when his parents got divorced. Rob realized that prior to this he 
had suffered no fear of flying. Just as he felt that his life was out 
of his control in an airplane, so he felt that the life of his family 
was out of his control when his parents announced their inten­
tion to divorce. 
Rob could see that the return of the phobia seemed to be 
precipitated by the painful reminder of the past that his father's 
new family rekindled. His struggle to achieve autonomy is con­
veyed in his attempt to go away by himself, only to have a 
recurrence of his phobia on the flight home—as he was return­
ing to face negative affects that he had pushed aside during 
his trip. Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 465 
Discussion 
Rob exhibits a wide range of affects. The influence of his family 
style, which minimizes affects, is also evident. This interferes 
with his regulation of affects. On occasion, the regulation does 
not work, and his sadness slips into depression, his anxiety into 
phobia. In spite of a tendency to intellectualize what he feels, 
Rob's affect regulation should not be overly pathologized. He is 
high-functioning in his work life, and he is well adjusted socially. 
It is evident that Rob brings to therapy a capacity for mentalized 
affectivity and is able to put it to good effect in the treatment. 
Rob's affectivity is revealed in his reassessment(s) of what he felt 
about his parents' divorce, allowing him to experience his own 
feelings in a more open and complex way. He has come to see 
that he had opted not to experience negative affects fully in 
connection with an important event from the past and that this 
has continued to influence his relationship in the present, and 
he embraces the ongoing task of reinterpretation. 
Rob's recognition that he had warded off feelings of depres­
sion about the divorce has spurred his movement into new 
affective experiences. He is able to move from feeling morose to 
feeling sad in a way that is accompanied by an affirmative sense 
of self-understanding.6 His sadness pertains to the demise of 
both his parents' and his own (first) relationship, but he has also 
come to appreciate that while he had no control over what 
happened with his parents, the end of his own relationship was 
neither out of his control nor opposed to his real wishes. As he 
has come to accept what he felt, so his sense of agency has been 
enhanced. An overall sense of gloom has lessened. 
6 Sadness is an affect, of course, that can be regarded as a developmental 
achievement. Melanie Klein's depressive position, for instance, occurs when a 
child is able to see the mother as a whole object—that is, as differentiated from 
himself—and thus experiences her absence as a loss. The distinction between 
sadness and depression is, I think, important to uphold—marking the difference 
between the normal and the pathological, but also highlighting that not all 
negative affects are equally undesirable. It can feel good to be sad, while the 
same cannot be said about being depressed (although it might feel comfortable, 
because it is familiar). The work of Samuel Beckett is preoccupied with discern­
ing the boundary between sadness and depression.

466 / Clinical Perspectives 
Rob's capacity for mentalized affectivity has room for growth. 
He has a tendency to suppress his feelings—a good example of 
this is revealed in his reaction to his father's new family. Rob 
knows that he was displeased with this development, and he is 
able to communicate this to a certain extent. However, there is 
something restrained about his reaction, reflecting his wish to 
sound reasonable and to edit his real feelings. Rob's tendency 
not to allow his affects to be expressed freely has produced 
countertransference responses on my part where I am aware of 
putting more affect into my voice, as if to provide examples of 
immediate affective reactions and to compensate for his low-key 
responses. This has been an issue in his relationship with his 
current girl friend: she has complained that he is not demon­
strative enough. 
Although Rob is someone who struggles to allow himself to 
express his affects, this should not be construed as exclusively 
meaning that he needs to learn to express them outwardly. The 
inward expression of affects is equally important. For example, 
Rob has started to become progressively more aware of his anger 
toward his father. Apart from whether and how he chooses 
to communicate this to his father, it has been crucial for Rob 
to allow himself to feel his resentment and to begin to separate 
himself from his family's style of downplaying all affective re­
sponses. In glimpsing that his father may not be willing to 
respond to his attempts to communicate with him, Rob's expres­
sion of his affects inwardly serves as a valuable affirmation of his 
own experience of the new family situation. 
The mentalized affectivity that Rob does exhibit in coming to 
terms with his parents' divorce and the impact it had on his life 
has come under stress with the fresh reminder that his own 
nuclear family dissolved as his father begins to constitute a new 
family. This does not contradict the suggestion that he possesses 
mentalized affectivity; rather, it highlights that circumstances 
can temporarily undermine affectivity or at least make it difficult 
to sustain. Indeed, mentalized affectivity can break down at the 
moment when the impact of a strong affect is felt. Normally, 
mentalized affectivity requires gaining some perspective, which, 
in the heat of the moment, can be beyond the capacity of most of 
us. It is certainly possible to acquire mentalized affectivity in Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 467 
situations where one has previously lacked It, but it would 
imprudent to fail to heed how much of a struggle it is to main­
tain it consistently. In drawing attention to Rob's ability to 
reflect on and craft his affects, I am acknowledging the sense in 
which affects are chosen; it should be clear, however, that I am 
not disputing the sense in which Rob feels that affects happen to 
him. My point is simply to emphasize that we can influence what 
we feel and, in addition, that psychotherapy can serve to develop 
and enhance mentalized affectivity. 
CONCLUSION 
These four cases present a spectrum from severe to mild psycho-
pathology, and correspondingly affectivity is better where the 
psychopathology is less severe. The first two examples are cases 
of severe mental illness: Teresa and Bennie have extensive psy­
chiatric histories and major mental disorders, and they have had 
numerous hospitalizations over the years. Teresa's range of af­
fect display is more limited than is Bennie's, and she lives a 
much more isolated life. Bennie has chosen to remain in therapy 
for a longer time; he has a strong bond with his therapist and is 
able to have moments of mentalized affectivity within the clinical 
setting. For both Teresa and Bennie, humor has been a way of 
establishing a connection with their therapist—the least danger­
ous way of sharing positive affect. 
Scott has a character disorder as well as a history of sub­
stance abuse. He has been able to free himself from the latter, 
and, after a number of years in treatment, his life has started to 
change significantly for the better. The quality of his relation­
ships is improving. He has begun to channel his considerable 
intellectual abilities in a productive direction. His ambitions are 
being realized, although grandiose fantasies continue to ob­
trude. In the case of Scott, we witness the development of 
mentalized affectivity within the course of the treatment itself. 
Rob's psychopathology is relatively mild. Despite the phobia 
and his unresolved feelings about his parents' divorce, he is 
high-functioning. He continues to have academic success; he

Rob's capacity for mentalized affectivity has room for growth. 
He has a tendency to suppress his feelings—a good example of 
this is revealed in his reaction to his father's new family. Rob 
knows that he was displeased with this development, and he is 
able to communicate this to a certain extent. However, there is 
something restrained about his reaction, reflecting his wish to 
sound reasonable and to edit his real feelings. Rob's tendency 
not to allow his affects to be expressed freely has produced 
countertransference responses on my part where I am aware of 
putting more affect into my voice, as if to provide examples of 
immediate affective reactions and to compensate for his low-key 
responses. This has been an issue in his relationship with his 
current girl friend: she has complained that he is not demon­
strative enough. 
Although Rob is someone who struggles to allow himself to 
express his affects, this should not be construed as exclusively 
meaning that he needs to learn to express them outwardly. The 
inward expression of affects is equally important. For example, 
Rob has started to become progressively more aware of his anger 
toward his father. Apart from whether and how he chooses 
to communicate this to his father, it has been crucial for Rob 
to allow himself to feel his resentment and to begin to separate 
himself from his family's style of downplaying all affective re­
sponses. In glimpsing that his father may not be willing to 
respond to his attempts to communicate with him, Rob's expres­
sion of his affects inwardly serves as a valuable affirmation of his 
own experience of the new family situation. 
The mentalized affectivity that Rob does exhibit in coming to 
terms with his parents' divorce and the impact it had on his life 
has come under stress with the fresh reminder that his own 
nuclear family dissolved as his father begins to constitute a new 
family. This does not contradict the suggestion that he possesses 
mentalized affectivity; rather, it highlights that circumstances 
can temporarily undermine affectivity or at least make it difficult 
to sustain. Indeed, mentalized affectivity can break down at the 
moment when the impact of a strong affect is felt. Normally, 
mentalized affectivity requires gaining some perspective, which, 
in the heat of the moment, can be beyond the capacity of most of 
us. It is certainly possible to acquire mentalized affectivity in Mentalized Affectivity in the Clinical Setting / 467 
situations where one has previously lacked It, but it would 
imprudent to fail to heed how much of a struggle it is to main­
tain it consistently. In drawing attention to Rob's ability to 
reflect on and craft his affects, I am acknowledging the sense in 
which affects are chosen; it should be clear, however, that I am 
not disputing the sense in which Rob feels that affects happen to 
him. My point is simply to emphasize that we can influence what 
we feel and, in addition, that psychotherapy can serve to develop 
and enhance mentalized affectivity.

elements of identifying, modulating, and expressing affects, 
helps us to understand how one's relation to one's own affects 
can be changed. Ultimately, the justification for such a concept

to demonstrate that there is a need for such a concept, and that

Research on the social development of infants has probably been 
the most influential advance in empirical science for psychoanal­
ysis. The work of Daniel Stern (1985, 1994) and Robert Emde 
(1997, 1980a, 1980b, 1981, 1988, 1992) established infant re­
search at the center of psychoanalytic theorization. The work 
reported in this volume has built on the achievement of these and 
other pioneers of infant research to produce a psychoanalytic 
model that, we hope, is of relevance to clinicians. 
There have been some cogent objections to the impact of 
infancy research on psychoanalysis. For example, Wolff (1996) 
warned of the epistemological dangers in extrapolating from 
infant research to the behavior of adult patients. Others point to 
what such perspectives omit from the traditional psychoanalytic 
approach (e.g., Fajardo 1993; Green 2000). We welcome this 
dialogue and to an extent agree with these cautions—particu­
larly that new ideas should not be felt to devalue the truth of the 
old, that the baby should always be taken safely out before 
dealing with the bath water. Nevertheless, we sense that many 
clinicians would join us in seeing the findings of psychoanalyti-
cally oriented empirical studies of early development as being of 
clear relevance to clinical understanding and technique. The

MENTAL MODELS AND PROCEDURES 
Developmental research has helped to revise some developmen­
tal propositions of psychoanalysis that turned out to be naive. 
For instance, there has been a shift in emphasis in psychoana­
lytic practice from a focus on the retrieval of forgotten experience 
to one where the creation of a meaningful narrative is regarded 
as mutative (e.g., Spence 1982, 1984). The interactional and 
interpersonal aspects of clinical work have become recognized as 
crucial, giving insight into the more primitive aspects of inter­
action seen in psychoanalysis (e.g., S. A. Mitchell' 1997). While 
we do not assume that formative experiences underlying these 
aspects have been retained in a way that allowed them to be 
recalled, analogies continually emerge between aspects of par­
ent-infant interaction and the analyst-patient relationship. 
Implicit in the understanding of these analogies is the idea 
that procedures, or patterns of actions rather than individual 
experiences, are retained from infant-caregiver interactions and 
that these procedures come to organize later behavior (Clyman 
1991). The procedures are organized as mental models (Johnson-
Laird and Byrne 1991, 1993). They should not be conceived of as 
pictures; they are better thought of as intricately interlinked 
sequences of events. Nevertheless, taken together, groups of 
procedures amount to a representation of a relationship, forever 
confined to the unconscious (phenomenologically rather than 
dynamically speaking) and observable only through an individu­
al's manner or style of relating, rather than through the ideas or 
memories described. The goal of therapy, then, is the observation 
of patterns of interaction and the identification and correction of 
maladaptive models, principally through strengthening an over­
arching mental capacity to activate alternative models of inter­
action selectively; in language influenced by cognitive science,

this capacity may be labeled "mentalization" or "reflective func­
tion.'' 
THE OBJECT AT THE CORE OF THE SELF 
Our concern in this book has been with individual differences in 
self-representational capacities and consequent differences in 
affect (Bleiberg 1984, 1994) and mentalization. At one extreme 
clinically we encountered individuals whose self-representation 
was so fragmented as to appear almost nonexistent, or so dis­
torted that it seemed completely out of touch with real emotional 
experience. Bleiberg (Bleiberg et al. 1997) has described severely 
personality-disordered children who experienced a sense of al­
most total alienation from their core self. These children present 
significant disturbances of social and emotional development, 
including marked impairment of peer relationships, affect regu­
lation, frustration tolerance, and impulse control, as well as poor 
self-esteem and poor self-image. Some of them, designated 
as Cluster A, show a more fragile reality contact and thought 
organization, particularly when faced with lack of structure. 
Idiosyncratic, magical thinking pervades their lives, but it ac­
quires greater intensity in emotionally charged contexts. Shy and 
friendless, they retreat to a world of bizarre fantasies, haunted 
by ideas of reference, suspiciousness, and extreme discomfort in 
social situations. Their ability to "make sense" of human ex­
changes and empathize with others is strikingly limited. They are 
equally impoverished in their capacity to communicate, which is 
hampered by the oddness of their speech and the constriction or 
inappropriateness of their affect. Descriptively, they generally 
resemble a range of DSM-IVs diagnoses that include schizotypal, 
schizoid, and milder forms of pervasive developmental disorder. 
They also resemble the children described by Cohen and col­
leagues as suffering from "multiplex developmental disorder" 
(Cohen, Towbin, Mayes, andVolkmar 1994). 
In contrast, a second group of youngsters, designated as 
Cluster B, shows intense, dramatic affect and hunger for social 
response. Clinginess and a vulnerability to separations, hyper-

Our concern in this book has been with individual differences in 
self-representational capacities and consequent differences in 
affect (Bleiberg 1984, 1994) and mentalization. At one extreme 
clinically we encountered individuals whose self-representation 
was so fragmented as to appear almost nonexistent, or so dis­

(Cohen, Towbin, Mayes, andVolkmar 1994). 
In contrast, a second group of youngsters, designated as 
Cluster B, shows intense, dramatic affect and hunger for social 
response. Clinginess and a vulnerability to separations, hyper-

activity, and temper tantrums are common features of their early 
development. By school age, they meet diagnostic criteria for an 
Axis I diagnosis; more commonly, attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, conduct disorder, separation anxiety disorder, or mood 
disorder. Many of these children appear anxious, moody, irri­
table, and explosive. Minor upsets or frustrations trigger intense 
affective storms—episodes of uncontrolled emotion, which are 
wholly out of proportion to the apparent precipitant. This affec­
tive lability mirrors the kaleidoscopic quality of these children's 
sense of self and others. One moment they feel elated and 
expansive, blissfully connected in perfect love and harmony 
with an idealized partner; the next moment they plunge into 
bitter disappointment and rage, coupled with self-loathing and 
despair. 
Self-centeredness is a striking characteristic of these chil­
dren. They need constant attention and respond with rage to 
rejection or indifference. Alternating between idealization and 
devaluation, they seductively and manipulatively strive to coerce 
others to provide them with a stream of emotional supplies. By 
the time they reach adolescence, drugs, food, or promiscuous 
sex have become common strategies to block feelings of subjec­
tive dyscontrol, fragmentation, and loneliness. Self-mutilation 
and suicidal gestures are common among girls, while aggres­
sion, coupled with hidden fears of rejection, is more typical of 
boys. This cluster of patients has been linked to early manifesta­
tions of "dramatic** personality disorders (in the adult personality 
disorder classification of DSM-IV, these would be the Cluster B 
disorders). 
In spite of the heterogeneity—and the obvious need for 
systematic studies to determine the validity and reliability of 
particular clinical and developmental clusters—these youngsters 
seem to share a crucial characteristic: some pervasively— 
Cluster A—and others intermittently—Cluster B—seem to lack 
the capacity to be aware of their own and other people's mental 
states. 
We conceive of such children as showing an extreme version 
of the strategy of insecure infants. Confronted with a frightened 
or frightening caregiver, they adapt via a wholesale internaliza­
tion of the caregiver's reaction to them. This leaves at the core of Epilogue / 473 
their self-structure the representation of the object rather than 
of the self. Not only is the child then out of touch with his affect, 
but he also experiences the self-representation as foreign to his 
internal experience, yet very much a part of himself. Internal 
coherence later becomes impossible to achieve without first ex­
ternalizing this alien part of the self-representation. We have 
suggested that this is why young children, classified in infancy 
as disorganized in their attachment, have been shown to behave 
in an unusually controlling way toward their parents. The object 
must be consistently controlled in order that It can remain an 
effective vehicle for the alien part of the self. 
The mechanism we have described in this book is a type of 
projective identification, although that construct is perhaps too 
broad to convey exactly what we intend here. One hallmark of 
the special category of projective identification we are describing 
is the desperation felt by the individual to be able to get rid of the 
unwanted aspects of the self. The alien part must be externalized 
for the child to feel a sense of being in touch with the real, 
experiencing self. The closer to the core of the self such an alien 
object resides, the greater the need for the physical presence of 
the other, to permit this externalization. For the child who was 
disorganized as an infant, the object who was internalized as 
part of the self-representation is the most likely vehicle for this 
projective process. Thus, even brief separations may feel like an 
impossible challenge. Often, in young children, the difficulty is 
compounded by the continuing need of the child for a mirroring 
object. They continue to attempt to find themselves in the other, 
at the same time as externalizing onto the other their alien self-
representation. This is very often a self-perpetuating pattern, 
where the child struggles to rid himself of parts of himself and 
actualize them in the parent, at the same time desperately 
needing the parent to reflect and strengthen the feeble but true 
core. If the parent or later attachment figure is able to accept the 
projection and yet retain some capacity for reflective functioning, 
then the course of the-child's development may be changed. In 
our experience, relatively few parents are able to change in this 
way. Commonly, quite a vicious transactional cycle develops, 
where the relative strength of the true self weakens and the 
corresponding need for externalization increases; the contact

described as a sadomasochistic relationship, though we would 
see this as misleading in that it suggests perverse erotic gratifi­
cation as the driving force. 
SOME SPECULATIONS 
ABOUT PATHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT 
As we have said, a fundamental need of every infant is to find his 
own mind, or intentional state, in the mind of the object. For the 
infant, internalization of this image performs the function of 
"containment," which Winnicott has written of as "giving back to 
the baby the baby's own self* (Winnicott 1967, p. 33) . Failure of 
this function leads to a desperate search for alternative ways of 
containing thoughts and the intense feelings they engender. The 
search for alternative ways of mental containment may, we have 
suggested, give rise to many pathological solutions, including 
taking the mind of the other, with its distorted, absent, or 
malign picture of the child, as part of the child's own sense of 
identity. 
With development, and exacerbated by the apparently sado­
masochistic patterns described above, this picture can become 
the germ of a persecutory object that is lodged in the self but is 
alien and unassimilable. There will be a desperate wish for 
separation in the hope of establishing an autonomous identity or 
existence. However, sadly, this identity is centered around a 
mental state that cannot reflect the changing emotional and 
cognitive states of the individual because it is based on an 
archaic representation of the other rather than on the thinking 
and feeling self as seen by the other. 
As for children, so for adults whose search for mirroring or 
containment has failed, the striving for separation will only 
produce a movement toward fusion. The more the person at­
tempts to become himself, the closer he moves toward becoming 
his object, because the latter is part of the self-structure. This 
may account for the familiar oscillation of borderline patients 
between the struggle for independence and the terrifying wish r 
Epilogue / 475 
for extreme closeness and fantasized union. Developmentally, a 
crisis may be expected to arise in late adolescence and early 
adulthood, when the external demand for separateness becomes 
irresistible. Self-destructive and (in the extreme) suicidal behav­
ior may then be perceived as the only feasible solution to an 
insoluble dilemma: the freeing of the self from the other through 
the destruction of the other within the self. 
In some people, for whom separateness is a chronic problem, 
we have assumed that the experience of selfhood can only be 
achieved through finding a physical other onto whom the other 
within the self can be projected. Thus, many will find leaving 
home very difficult and only sustainable by finding an alterna­
tive, comparable figure onto whom the other within the self may 
be projected. If the other person dies or leaves, a pathological 
mourning process may be initiated, whereby the person feels 
compelled to maintain a live picture of the other in order to shore 
up the integrity of the self. 
Another possible outcome of poor development of the psycho­
logical self is that the body may be used to contain and enact 
mental states. In these cases the child's own body comes to serve 
the function of second-order representation of feelings, ideas, 
and wishes. Violence toward the body of the self (e.g., self-

or "mindless violence") may be a way of "controlling" mental

In both physical violence and self-destructive acts, a number

the person's own mind, (b) In both externally and internally

SOME SPECULATIONS 
ABOUT PATHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT 
As we have said, a fundamental need of every infant is to find his 
own mind, or intentional state, in the mind of the object. For the 
infant, internalization of this image performs the function of 
"containment," which Winnicott has written of as "giving back to 
the baby the baby's own self* (Winnicott 1967, p. 33) . Failure of 
this function leads to a desperate search for alternative ways of 
containing thoughts and the intense feelings they engender. The 
search for alternative ways of mental containment may, we have 
suggested, give rise to many pathological solutions, including 
taking the mind of the other, with its distorted, absent, or 
malign picture of the child, as part of the child's own sense of 
identity. 
With development, and exacerbated by the apparently sado­
masochistic patterns described above, this picture can become 
the germ of a persecutory object that is lodged in the self but is 
alien and unassimilable. There will be a desperate wish for 
separation in the hope of establishing an autonomous identity or 
existence. However, sadly, this identity is centered around a 
mental state that cannot reflect the changing emotional and 
cognitive states of the individual because it is based on an 
archaic representation of the other rather than on the thinking 
and feeling self as seen by the other. 
As for children, so for adults whose search for mirroring or 
containment has failed, the striving for separation will only 
produce a movement toward fusion. The more the person at­
tempts to become himself, the closer he moves toward becoming 
his object, because the latter is part of the self-structure. This 
may account for the familiar oscillation of borderline patients 
between the struggle for independence and the terrifying wish r

for extreme closeness and fantasized union. Developmentally, a 
crisis may be expected to arise in late adolescence and early 
adulthood, when the external demand for separateness becomes 
irresistible. Self-destructive and (in the extreme) suicidal behav­
ior may then be perceived as the only feasible solution to an 
insoluble dilemma: the freeing of the self from the other through 
the destruction of the other within the self. 
In some people, for whom separateness is a chronic problem, 
we have assumed that the experience of selfhood can only be 
achieved through finding a physical other onto whom the other 
within the self can be projected. Thus, many will find leaving 
home very difficult and only sustainable by finding an alterna­
tive, comparable figure onto whom the other within the self may 
be projected. If the other person dies or leaves, a pathological 
mourning process may be initiated, whereby the person feels 
compelled to maintain a live picture of the other in order to shore 
up the integrity of the self. 
Another possible outcome of poor development of the psycho­
logical self is that the body may be used to contain and enact 
mental states. In these cases the child's own body comes to serve 
the function of second-order representation of feelings, ideas, 
and wishes. Violence toward the body of the self (e.g., self-
cutting) or that of the other (apparently unprovoked aggression 
or "mindless violence") may be a way of "controlling" mental 
states that are invested in bodily states (e.g., the mother seen as 
part of one's own body) or destroying "ideas" experienced as 
being within the body of the other. 
In both physical violence and self-destructive acts, a number 
of factors combine, (a) In these acts the individual functions in a 
nonmentalizing mode of psychic equivalence. There is both an 
intolerance of alternative perspectives—that is, these have to be 
destroyed—and a belief that by destroying the person represent­
ing the idea, the persecuting idea itself will be eradicated from 
the person's own mind, (b) In both externally and internally 
directed aggression, there are indications of the persistence of a 
pretend mode of functioning, in that at one level the individual 
perceives his acts as inconsequential, except in obliterating the 
intolerable thoughts. External reality can be ignored: the overr 
dose can be conceived as getting rid of certain thoughts belong-

ing to another, yet leaving the body unharmed, (c) The absence 
of mentalizing removes key restraints on action against both the 
self and the other. Even when someone can intellectually con­
ceive of the impact of his or her actions on another person, this 
may be felt as meaningless, empty of emotional conviction (Blair 
1995). Linked to this may be a reason why women more com­
monly self-harm, whereas men are more often aggressive toward 
others. We would suggest that for women, the image of the 
mother (most often the primary caregiver in early life) resides 
more easily in their own body, whereas for men it is easier to 
externalize this and the thoughts it represents onto others. 
In extreme cases, where the child has found no alternative 
relationship in which his thoughts and feelings are perceived 
and reflected, his own potential for reflective capacity will not be 
fulfilled. In cases of abusive, hostile, or simply totally vacuous 
relationships with the caregiver, the infant may deliberately turn 
away from the object; the contemplation of the object's mind is 
overwhelming as it harbors frankly hostile intentions toward the 
infant's self. This may lead to a widespread avoidance of mental 
states, which further reduces the chance of identifying and 
establishing intimate links with an understanding object. 
As studies of resilient children suggest, even a single secure/ 
understanding relationship may be sufficient for the develop­
ment of reflective processes and may "save" the child. We do not 
anticipate that trauma outside the context of a close attachment 
would pervasively stunt the development of mentalization. It is 
because reflective function evolves in the context of intense 
interpersonal relationships that the fear of the mind of another 
can have such devastating consequences on the emergence of 
social understanding. 
If the traumatized child has had no social support of suffi­
cient strength and intensity for an attachment bond and then 
reflectiveness to develop, then the experience of later trauma or 
abuse will probably not be reflected on or resolved. Naturally, 
the unresolved experience of abuse diminishes the likelihood 
of meaningful relationships, which, in a self-perpetuating way, 
makes it more difficult to reach a satisfactory resolution of the 
disturbing experience through reflective processes. In fact, a Epilogue / 477 
pattern may be established whereby suspicion and distrust gen­
eralize and lead to a turning away from the mental state of most 
important others and to an apparent "decoupling" of thinking 
about people, leaving the person bereft. The "neediness" of peo­
ple with borderline personality disorders seems to be a step in 
this direction; no sooner do they become involved with another 
person than the malfunctioning of their mentalizing capacity 
leads them into confusion and chaos within the relationship. 
They may regress to the intersubjective state of earlier mental 
representation, no longer able to differentiate their own mental 
representations from those of others and either of these from 
external reality. As these processes combine, they may become 
terrorized by their own thoughts about the other—particularly 
their aggressive impulses and fantasies—experienced (via projec­
tion) as in the other; these become crippling, and most com­
monly they reject or arrange to be rejected by their object. 
Psychoanalysis or psychotherapy can break the vicious cycle by 
reinforcing reflective capacity. 
PSYCHOTHERAPY AND MENTALIZING 
Acceptance of this model does not imply a change in psycho­
therapeutic practice, or that these ideas are relevant to most 
forms of later pathology. Many patients with neurotic problems 
have relatively good reflective capacities, founded (we would 
suggest) on adequate early attachment relationships and on 
adequate mentalizing capacities in at least one caregiver. In these 
cases, we see traditional psychoanalytic understanding and the 
interpretation of current unconscious conflicts as very powerful 
and able to produce substantial, lasting change. It does, however, 
call for a reappraisal of the relative importance of aspects of 
technique in cases showing the kinds of early developmental 
failure that we have tried to describe. This means that certain 
more supportive techniques may shift from the status of param­
eter to mutative components, at least in the early stages of what 
is likely to be a prolonged analysis.

478 / Epilogue 
In these cases of severe character and developmental pathol­
ogy the focus on reflective function in psychopathology brings 
with it an implication concerning the role of insight. Insight is an 
unlikely goal early on, given the profound limitations on listen­
ing to and understanding interpretations shown by these pa­
tients. In some less severe cases, the therapist may be impressed 
by the patient's apparent receptiveness to interpretations and 
may only become suspicious in the long term when the apparent 
building of insight fails to lead to significant change. Patients 
such as these acquire insight within what we would see as a 
pretend mode, where reflection is possible as long as it is kept 
separate from everyday reality. In other words, the patient plays 
at being in analysis but is unable to integrate it with genuine 
feeling or meaning. 
What are the analyst's goals when understanding is unattain­
able at first and is in fact perceived as a serious threat? We aim 
to enhance certain psychic processes. To do this, the analyst 
needs, of course, to create an environment within which think­
ing about feelings and ideas can be experienced as safe, perhaps 
for the first time. There is then the opportunity for the patient to 
find himself as a thinking and feeling person within the analyst's 
mind. The analyst presents a picture to the patient that is 
related to the patient's experience at that moment but is also 
sufficiently different for the patient to learn the possibility of 
alternative perspectives. There is a constant and sometimes 
overwhelming pressure on the analyst to accept the patient's 
externalization, and this she must do, in a way, for a refusal to 
do so brings about the experience of the self as destroyed by the 
return of the alien other. Yet by becoming this other person, 
the analyst would have obliterated her capacity to think about 
the patient. The situation is made more difficult because un­
like talking to more neurotic patients about the transference, 
the simple presentation of the dilemma to the patient has little 
effect. 
The analyst's task is primarily to remain in touch with the 
patient's mental state, despite the patient's dramatic enact­
ments, to address and challenge the patient's mental capacities 
by verbalizing internal states, differentiating feelings, breaking Epilogue / 479 
down unmanageable anxiety-provoking experiences into simpler, 
more manageable entities, helping the development of an "as-if* 
attitude where ideas can begin to be thought about as ideas 
rather than as reality, yet retaining their links to the internal 
world, and so on. We think of these interventions as "small 
interpretations," generally pertaining to aspects of the mental 
world that are neither unconscious nor overly complex. In neu­
rotic patients, such feelings and thoughts would require no 
elaboration on the part of the analyst, yet without such back­
ground work the analysis of severely disturbed people is, we 
suggest, bound to fail, ending prematurely or turning into an 
impasse. 
Psychoanalysis inevitably deals with individuals whose past 
experience has left them vulnerable to current stress and to the 
repetition of adverse early experiences. The treatment of people 
such as those we have focused on in this chapter involves an 
elaborative, mentalistic stance. This enhances the development 
of reflective self-function and may in the long run enhance the 
psychic resilience of individuals in a generic way, providing them 
with improved control over their system of representation of 
relationships. It can equip them with a kind of self-righting 
capacity where, through being able to make their representa­
tional models more flexible, they can be reviewed and changed. 
Such gradual and constant adjustments facilitate the develop­
ment of an internal world where the behavior of others may be 
experienced as understandable, meaningful, predictable, and 
human. This reduces the need for the splitting of frightening and 
incoherent mental representations of mental states, and new 
experiences of other minds can more readily be integrated into 
the framework of past relationship representations. 
The abused or traumatized child, evading or entangled in the 
mental world, never acquires adequate regulatory control over 
the representational world of internal working models. Unhelpful 
models of relationship patterns emerge frequently, and the in­
ternal world of the child and adult comes to be dominated by 
negative affect. Caught in a vicious cycle of paranoid anxiety and 
exaggerated defensive maneuvers, the person becomes inextrica­
bly entangled in an internal world dominated by dangerous, evil,
