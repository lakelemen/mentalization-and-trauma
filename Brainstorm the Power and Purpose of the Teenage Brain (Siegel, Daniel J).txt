PART I
The Essence of Adolescence
Adolescence isasmuch aperplexing time oflifeasitisan
amazing one. Running roughly between theages oftwelve
andtwenty-four (yes, into ourmid-twenties!), adolescence is
known across cultures asatime ofgreat challenge forboth
adolescents andtheadults who support them. Because itcan
besochallenging foreveryone involved, Ihope tooffer
support toboth sides ofthegenerational divide. Ifyouarean
adolescent reading thisbook, itismyhope that itwill help
you make your way through theattimes painful, atother
times thrilling personal journey thatisadolescence. Ifyouare
the parent ofanadolescent, orateacher, acounselor,
anathletic coach, oramentor who works with adolescents,
myhope isthat these explorations will help you help the
adolescent inyour lifenotjustsurvive butthrive through this
incredibly formative time.
Letmesayfrom thevery start that there arealotofmyths
surrounding adolescence that science now clearly shows us
aresimply nottrue. And even worse than being wrong, these
false beliefs can actually make life more difficult for
adolescents andadults alike. Solet’s bust these myths right
now.
One ofthemost powerful myths surrounding adolescence is
that raging hormones cause teenagers to“gomad” or“lose
their minds.” That’s simply false. Hormones doincrease
during thisperiod, butitisnotthehormones thatdetermine
what goes oninadolescence. We now know that what
adolescents experience isprimarily theresult ofchanges in
thedevelopment ofthebrain. Knowing about these changes
12

canhelp lifeflow more smoothly foryouasanadolescent or
for you as an adult with adolescents in your world.
Another myth isthat adolescence issimply atime of
immaturity and teens just need to“grow up.” With such a
restricted view ofthe situation, it’s nosurprise that
adolescence isseen assomething thateveryone justneeds to
endure, tosomehow survive and leave behind with asfew
battle scars aspossible. Yes, being anadolescent can be
confusing andterrifying, assomany things during thistime
arenew andoften intense. And foradults, what adolescents
domay seem confounding andeven senseless. Believe me,as
the father oftwo adolescents, Iknow. The view that
adolescence issomething wealljustneed toendure isvery
limiting. Tothecontrary, adolescents don’t just need to
survive adolescence; they canthrive because ofthisimportant
period oftheir lives. What doImean bythis? Acentral idea
that we’ll discuss isthat, invery key ways, the“work” of
adolescence—the testing ofboundaries, thepassion toexplore
what isunknown and exciting—can setthestage forthe
development ofcore character traits that will enable
adolescents togoontolead great lives ofadventure and
purpose.
13

Athird myth isthatgrowing upduring adolescence requires
moving from dependence onadults tototal independence
from them. While there isanatural and necessary push
toward independence from the adults who raised us,
adolescents still benefit from relationships with adults. The
healthy move toadulthood istoward interdependence, not
complete “do-it-yourself” isolation. The nature ofthebonds
14

thatadolescents have with their parents asattachment figures
changes, and friends become more important during this
period. Ultimately, welearn tomove from needing others’
care during childhood, topushing away from ourparents and
other adults and leaning more on our peers during
adolescence, tothen both giving care andreceiving help from
others. That’s interdependence. Inthisbook we’ll explore the
nature ofthese attachments and how our need forclose
relationships continues throughout the life span.
When wegetbeyond themyths, weareable toseethereal
truths they mask, andlifeforadolescents, andtheadults in
their lives, gets a whole lot better.
Unfortunately, what others believe about uscanshape how
weseeourselves andhow webehave. This isespecially true
when itcomes toteens and how they “receive” commonly
held negative attitudes that many adults project (whether
directly orindirectly)—that teens are“out ofcontrol” or
“lazy” or“unfocused.” Studies show thatwhen teachers were
told that certain students had “limited intelligence,” these
students performed worse than other students whose teachers
were not similarly informed. But when teachers were
informed that these same students hadexceptional abilities,
thestudents showed marked improvement intheir testscores.
Adolescents who areabsorbing negative messages about who
they areandwhat isexpected ofthem may sink tothatlevel
instead ofrealizing their true potential. AsJohann Wolfgang
von Goethe wrote, “Treat people asifthey were what they
ought tobeandyouhelp them become what they arecapable
ofbeing.” Adolescence isnotaperiod ofbeing “crazy” or
“immature.” Itisanessential time ofemotional intensity,
social engagement, andcreativity. This istheessence ofhow
15

we“ought” tobe,ofwhat wearecapable of,andofwhat we
need as individuals and as a human family.
Brainstorm issetupasfollows: The first part examines the
essence ofadolescence andhow understanding itsimportant
dimensions cancreate vitality now and throughout thelife
span. The second part explores theway thebrain grows
during adolescence sothat wecan make themost ofthe
opportunities thisperiod oflifecreates forus.The third part
explores how relationships shape oursense ofidentity and
what wecandotocreate stronger connections with others and
with ourselves. Inthefourth part, wedive into theways in
which thechanges andchallenges ofadolescence canbebest
navigated bybeing present, bybeing receptive towhat is
happening sothat wecanbefully aware oftheinner and
interpersonal aspects ofthese experiences. I’llalso provide
practical steps along theway, intheMindsight Tools sections,
which offer science-proven ways tostrengthen ourbrains and
our relationships.
Because weeach learn most effectively indifferent ways, you
may want toexperience this book inwhatever approach is
best foryou after reading Part I.Ifyou enjoy learning by
blending concepts andfacts with science andstories, reading
thebook from front toback might bebest. Ifinstead youlearn
best bydoing, byactual practice, then thefour Mindsight
Tools sections would beauseful place tostart; you can
explore thescience andstories later. Iwrote thebook insuch
away that ifyou want todive into aparticular topic, you
candosobyreading that part first—for relationships that
would bePartIII,while forthebrain thatwould bePart II.If
you learn best bystory-driven discussions, you might read
Part IVfirst, andtheearlier sections andpractice entries later.

Mix itupandfind what works best foryou. Theparts andthe
Tools sections fittogether asawhole; it’suptoyouhow to
sample them in a way that meets your needs.
This book isallabout understanding and nurturing the
essential features ofadolescence tobring themost health and
happiness into the world regardless of what age we are.
The Benefits and Challenges of Adolescence
The essential features ofadolescence emerge because of
healthy, natural changes inthe brain. Since the brain
influences both ourminds and ourrelationships, knowing
about thebrain canhelp uswith ourinner experience andour
social connections. Inour journey I’ll show how this
understanding, andlearning thesteps tostrengthen thebrain
inpractical ways, canhelp usbuild amore resilient mind and
more rewarding relationships with others.
During theteen years, our minds change intheway we
remember, think, reason, focus attention, make decisions, and
relate toothers. From around agetwelve toagetwenty-four,
there isaburst ofgrowth and maturation taking place as
never before inourlives. Understanding thenature ofthese
changes canhelp uscreate amore positive andproductive life
journey.
I’mthefather oftwoadolescents. Ialso work asaphysician
inthepractice ofchild, adolescent, and adult psychiatry,
helping kids, teens, adults, couples, andfamilies make sense
ofthis exciting time inlife. Inaddition toworking asa
psychotherapist, Ialso teach about mental health. What has
struck meineach ofthese roles isthat there isnobook
available that reveals theview that theadolescent period of
lifeisinreality theonewith themost power forcourage and
17

creativity. Life isonfirewhen wehitourteens. And these
changes arenotsomething toavoid orjustgetthrough, butto
encourage. Brainstorm was born from theneed tofocus on
thepositive essence ofthisperiod oflifeforadolescents and
for adults.
While theadolescent years may bechallenging, thechanges
inthebrain that help support theunique emergence ofthe
adolescent mind cancreate qualities inusthathelp notonly
during ouradolescent years, ifused wisely, butalso aswe
enter adulthood andlivefully asanadult. How wenavigate
theadolescent years hasadirect impact onhow we’ll livethe
restofourlives. Those creative qualities also canhelp our
larger world, offering new insights and innovations that
naturally emerge from thepush back against thestatus quo
and from the energy of the teen years.
Forevery new way ofthinking andfeeling andbehaving with
itspositive potential, there isalso apossible downside. Yet
there isaway tolearn how tomake themost oftheimportant
positive qualities oftheteenage mind during adolescence and
to use those qualities well in the adult years that come later.
Brain changes during theearly teen years setupfour qualities
ofour minds during adolescence: novelty seeking, social
engagement, increased emotional intensity, and creative
exploration. There arechanges inthefundamental circuits of
thebrain that make theadolescent period different from
childhood. These changes affect how teens seek rewards in
trying new things, connect with their peers indifferent ways,
feel more intense emotions, and push back ontheexisting
ways ofdoing things tocreate new ways ofbeing inthe
world. Each ofthese changes isnecessary tocreate the
important shifts that happen inour thinking, feeling,
18

interacting, anddecision making during ouradolescence. Yes,
these positive changes have negative possibilities, too. Let’s
seehow each ofthese four features oftheadolescent brain’s
growth hasboth upsides anddownsides, andhow they fillour
lives with both benefits and risks.
1.Novelty seeking emerges from anincreased drive for
rewards inthecircuits oftheadolescent brain thatcreates the
inner motivation totrysomething new and feel lifemore
fully, creating more engagement inlife.Downside: Sensation
seeking and risk taking that overemphasize thethrill and
downplay therisk result indangerous behaviors andinjury.
Impulsivity canturn anidea intoanaction without apause to
reflect ontheconsequences. Upside: Being open tochange
andliving passionately emerge, astheexploration ofnovelty
ishoned into afascination forlifeandadrive todesign new
ways of doing things and living with a sense of adventure.
2.Social engagement enhances peer connectedness and
creates new friendships. Downside: Teens isolated from
adults andsurrounded only byother teens have increased-risk
behavior, and the total rejection ofadults and adult
knowledge andreasoning increases those risks. Upside: The
drive forsocial connection leads tothecreation ofsupportive
relationships that aretheresearch-proven best predictors of
well-being, longevity, and happiness throughout the life span.
3.Increased emotional intensity gives anenhanced vitality to
life. Downside: Intense emotion may ruletheday, leading to
impulsivity, moodiness, and extreme, sometimes unhelpful,
reactivity. Upside: Life lived with emotional intensity canbe
filled with energy and asense ofvital drive that give an
exuberance and zest for being alive on the planet.
19

4.Creative exploration with an expanded sense of
consciousness. Anadolescent’s new conceptual thinking and
abstract reasoning allow questioning ofthe status quo,
approaching problems with “out ofthebox” strategies, the
creation ofnew ideas, and theemergence ofinnovation.
Downside: Searching forthemeaning oflifeduring theteen
years canlead toacrisis ofidentity, vulnerability topeer
pressure, andalack ofdirection andpurpose. Upside: Ifthe
mind canhold ontothinking andimagining andperceiving
theworld innew ways within consciousness, ofcreatively
exploring thespectrum ofexperiences that arepossible, the
sense ofbeing inarutthatcansometimes pervade adult life
canbeminimized andinstead anexperience ofthe“ordinary
being extraordinary” canbecultivated. Notabadstrategy for
living a full life!
While wecanbrainstorm lotsofnew ideas inside usthatwe
canshare collaboratively during thecreative explorations and
novelty seeking ofadolescence, wecanalso enter another
kind ofbrainstorm aswelose ourcoordination andbalance
andouremotions actlikeatsunami, flooding uswith feelings.
That’s when wegetfilled with notonly mental excitement but
also with mental confusion. Adolescence involves both types
of brainstorms.
Inanutshell, thebrain changes ofadolescence offer both risk
and opportunity. How we navigate the waters of
adolescence—as young individuals onthejourney orasadults
walking with them—can help guide theship that isourlife
into treacherous places orinto exciting adventures. The
decision is ours.
Maintaining thePower andPurpose oftheAdolescent Mind
into Adulthood
20

Too often Ihear adults inmypractice saythattheir lifeisina
rut. They feel “stuck” or“empty,” have lost their
novelty-seeking drive, andarefilled with theboredom ofjust
doing thesame oldthings over andover again. They also find
their lives filled with alack ofsocial connectedness —they
feel isolated and alone. And formany, life has lost its
emotional intensity, things feel lackluster, even boring. This
ennui can lead toapathy oreven depression and despair.
Nothing seems tomatter; nothing seems tofeelalive orvital.
When adults stop using their potential for creative
exploration ,theway they reason andapproach life’s problems
becomes simply arepeated familiar routine andimagination
goes outthewindow. Life canbecome, well, lifeless. When
adults lose thecreative power oftheadolescent mind, their
lives can lose vitality and become meaningless.
The playfulness andhumor thatemerge from thecreation of
new combinations ofthings areessential tokeep ourlives full
ofvitality. Hang outwith teens andyou’ll often hear laughter
andhysterics. And sometimes you’ll hear alotofcrying. So
emotional intensity canbring joy, anditcanbring tears, for
sure. Hang outwith many adults, and you’ll often hear
predominantly serious talk. Yes, lifeisserious. Butwecan
bring joyandhumor tothese lives welead. Weneed tolive
with humor andzest, notinspite oftheworld’s problems but
because of them.
Yet when adults lose thefour distinguishing features of
adolescence, when they stop cultivating thepower ofnovelty
seeking, social engagement, emotional intensity, andcreative
exploration, life can become boring, isolating, dull, and
routinized. Who would intentionally choose tolivelikethat?
Most likely noone. Butithappens allthetime. Itseems we
21

adults areprone tojustcruise onauto pilot. Why? Itcanbe
difficult coping with life’s circumstances, toface theworld’s
stresses. Sometimes it’s easier tojust shut down these
essential aspects ofavital lifethatcome during adolescence
andinstead tryandstay in“survival mode” aswedevelop a
routine wecanrelyontofunction. Butallowing ourselves to
lose ourvitality will only make lifeharder—and italso can
lead tonotkeeping thebrain asstrong asitcould beaswe
age.
SoI’msuggesting thatwhat adolescents have going forthem
thatisboth achallenge andagiftisactually what adults need
inorder tomaintain vitality intheir lives. Here’s another
myth. People tend toassume that thebrain stops growing
after childhood. Butthat’s nottrue. Thebrain notonly grows
andchanges during childhood andadolescence, butcontinues
togrow throughout thelifespan. Myproposal toyouisthat
thefour features ofadolescence areexactly what weneed to
notonly liveavital lifeasteens, butalso tokeep ourbrains
growing throughout our lives.
Here’s away toremember this“essence” ofthebrain changes
inadolescence. Ilove acronyms, much tomystudents’ either
delight ordismay. Soifthisacronym ishelpful foryou, great.
Here itis:The essence oftheadolescent brain changes that
aretheessence ofhealthy ways ofliving throughout thelife
span spell the word essence itself:
ES: Emotional Spark —honoring these important internal
sensations thataremore intense during adolescence butserve
to create meaning and vitality throughout our lives.
22

SE: Social Engagement —the important connections wehave
with others that support our journeys through life with
meaningful, mutually rewarding relationships.
N:Novelty —how weseek outand create new experiences
that engage usfully, stimulating our senses, emotions,
thinking, and bodies in new and challenging ways.
CE: Creative Explorations —the conceptual thinking, abstract
reasoning, andexpanded consciousness thatcreate agateway
to seeing the world through new lenses.
This istheessence ofliving well during adolescence and
during theadult years: Emotional Spark—Social
Engagement—Novelty—Creative Explorations .
Adol-ESSENCE. Or: Adolescence is Adult-ESSENCE .
23

Iwonder ifsome ofthetension that Iseeinparents asa
reaction toward adolescents isattimes adeep longing for
these very features they themselves may have lost. Nothaving
anemotional spark canmake ateen’s exuberance threatening.
Not being socially engaged can make anadult feel
disconnected intheface ofateen’s social life. How many
new friends didwemake atages thirty, forty, orfifty? Allthe
drive fornew things inanadolescent’s lifecan make an
adult’s daily routines seem dull. And thecreative explorations
that drive ateen into allsorts ofnew ways ofthinking and
24

behaving canmake thehumdrum andpredictability ofadult
life at times seem too controlled and too limiting.
Perhaps ifadults could recapture some ofthisvital essence
thegapbetween thegenerations would lessen. What Imean
bythisisthatsometimes what weseeinothers canremind us
ofwhat wearemissing inourselves, andthisreminder makes
usfrustrated, disappointed, angry, orsad.Asatherapist, Isee
this alltoooften, when, forinstance, parents cannot stand
some aspect oftheir child’s personality because itreminds
them ofsomething thatbugs them about their own life. Ifwe
take adeep breath and realize wearealllifelong learners,
then anadult’s intense emotional reaction toateen, for
example, canserve asareminder forustoexplore ourown
inner lives and not simply react outwardly.
Adults have things tolearn from adolescence asaperiod we
went through andfrom adolescents astheones going through
thatdevelopmental period right now. Adolescents canremind
usofwhat wehave aright toexperience inour lives.
Similarly, asadolescents wehave things tolearn from adults,
asadults share with ustheir experiences asthey support our
development toward independence.
Learning tousethepower oftheadolescent mind canhelp us
have apositive experience asitemerges during thisperiod of
intense change. When navigated well, these brain changes can
lead topositive outcomes later on.Holding ontotheessential
power oftheteenage mind intolater adolescence andbeyond,
into theadult years, can enable ustocontinue lifelong
learning andrecognize theimportant life-affirming sense of
adventure, vitality, and courage that adolescence brings.
Learning tousethepower oftheemerging adolescent mind
25

well isasimportant forusasadolescents asitisforusas
adults!
Adolescence from the Inside Out
We’ll be exploring the essence of adolescence from an “inside
out” approach. What this means isthat wecanlearn how
understanding ourown orothers’ inner workings canhelp us
understand theouter behaviors ofourselves and ofothers.
This inside-out understanding canhelp uscreate thelifewe
want, notsimply settle forwhat wearegiven. Totake onthis
inside-out approach, we’ll learn about how the brain,
self-awareness, and relating toothers allhelp create the
experience ofwho we are—how they help create our
minds—so thatwecanbebetter equipped forthisperiod of
life.
We’ll also explore important andrelevant scientific ideas and
reveal how toapply science inhelpful ways. This book is
written sothat itfeels like aconversation between meas
author andyouasreader. Myhope isthatreading itwillmake
you feel asifweareactually talking together, inperson,
about this important period of life.
I’m excited toinvite you tojoin with me inthis
conversation-like exploration toput yourself inthe
experience, toreflect onwhat isgoing oninyour own life.
With two adolescents inmypersonal lifenow, one inhis
early twenties andtheother inherlateteens, Iampresented
every daywith theopportunities andchallenges ofbeing a
parent oftwo individuals going through this period oflife.
And being their father also recalls the memories and
meanings ofmyown adolescent years. I’llshare with youas
26

wegoalong some ofthese inside-out reflections that are
directly relevant to the topics we’ll be focusing on.
Foryouasanadolescent, these discussions caninvite youto
think about your own lifenow. Ifyou areanadult reading
this, you may find yourself reflecting onwhat isgoing on
now orwhat went oninyour own adolescence. Your reading
experience—like mywriting experience—is intended asan
invitation for ustobecome actively involved ina
conversation with each other andforyou toreflect onyour
own experiences with me.You may find ithelpful tokeep a
personal journal tocapture your own reflections, aprocess
that may feel good and also one that hasbeen shown to
support theability tomake sense ofthings. Ifyouarelooking
forajourney ofdiscovery where what youlearn andwhat you
reflect oncanhelp you travel through theadolescent years
andharness thecreative power ofthisperiod andhold onto
itsessence with more knowledge, insight, andunderstanding,
you’ve come to the right place.
27

Wenever stop discovering who weareorwhat hasmeaning
inlife. Our minds continually emerge inways that can
support ahealthy, exuberant lifeaswegrow and develop
throughout ourlives. Sothis istruly anexploration Iam
asking you tojoin mein,notsome download offacts and
figures, notjustabunch ofopinions andmandates onwhat
youshould do.And whether youareinadolescence oradult
years, thisexploration canhelp your mind emerge inhelpful
ways. Since thisisaconversation, itmeans we’ll beasking
questions, basic questions, that we’ll wrestle with aswe
attempt toanswer them. The fact isthat wedon’t know the
28

final answers toalotofquestions about thebrain orthemind,
butasking them andsearching fortheanswers areessential
steps for us to take.
Myown kids askmewhy Iliketeaching somuch, andIsayit
isbecause Iamalways learning when Iconnect with people
ineducational experiences. Ifeelit’sanimportant stance to
take—that wearelifelong learners. Tohave anunderstanding
ofwhere another person iscoming from during this
developmental period helps everyone navigate itwell and
continue to grow.
During childhood, parents areoften seen asthebe-all and
end-all ofrolemodels. Infact, adolescence isatime when we
begin toseeourparents asactual people, notheroes, who
have their own flaws andlimitations. Perhaps seeing parents
inthisway helps usleave them andgooutintotheworld. As
Mark Twain once said, “When Iwas aboy offourteen, my
father was soignorant Icould hardly stand tohave theold
man around. But when Igot tobetwenty-one, Iwas
astonished athow much theoldman had learned inseven
years.”
Naturally, pushing away from thestatus quoisafundamental
way tocreate novel experiences. And novelty seeking isboth
apart ofthe push back and inherently rewarding.
Adolescence isalso atime filled with new ideas. Inmany
ways, seeking novelty isrewarding asitfills experiences,
behaviors, perceptions, thoughts, ideas, intentions, andbeliefs
with the spirit of adventure.
This striving fornovelty isacreative power that can be
harnessed forthebenefit ofeveryone, ifweseethis move
toward new things andindependence inapositive way. On
29

theother hand, ifadults fight against these fundamental
features ofadolescence, it’slike fighting against thenatural
push ofawaterfall. The force ofadolescence will find some
way tomanifest itself inateen’s external actions andinternal
mental shifts. You cannot stop awaterfall, butyoucanlearn
to direct its course and harness its power.
Thegood news isthatthedevelopmental state ofadolescence
does not have tobeexperienced asawar between the
generations. Ifadults trytoblock theflow ofadolescence, it
30

islikely that communication, soimportant torelationships,
will betainted with tension and disrespect. Disconnection,
secrecy, isolation, andmany other negative andhurtful social
responses canemerge. The keyisfortheadolescent andthe
adult-who-once-was-an-adolescent to recognize these
important brain changes and learn tonavigate these years
constructively and collaboratively inorder tokeep
communication open between them, tooptimize life for
everyone, andtoavoid tragic endings ofrisky behaviors. The
challenge is not easy, but it at least should be made clear.
This isourbalancing act,foradolescents and adults alike:
making thepush toward independence, thedrive forreward,
and the passion for novelty result in positive outcomes in life.
The brain isourenabler—our control center—and thegood
news isthatwhen weunderstand thebrain, wecanharness its
powerful drives tomake positive choices and constructive
changes inourlives. Understanding how thebrain links its
different circuits, how itbecomes integrated with
development, isauseful way ofseeing how wecan help
promote optimal functioning inourlives during adolescence
and beyond. This integration isaltering the linkage of
different areas inthebrain, andeven between people, thatcan
help usunderstand and optimize theimportant changes in
adolescence.
Here isthepowerful finding from science: You canlearn the
steps tomake your brain more integrated andtostrengthen it.
You canlearn how toimprove theway your mind functions
and make your brain healthier and your relationships more
rewarding. These arethebasic things we’ll explore inthe
pages ahead. You’ll learn through stories andscience about
these important aspects ofyour life; and you’ll beoffered
31

practices tocreate more integration inyour life. And ifyou
learn these things, they canmake therestofyour lifebetter.
No kidding.
Risk and Reward
While most measurable aspects ofourlives areimproving
during adolescence, such asphysical strength, immune
function, resistance toheat andcold, andthespeed andagility
ofhow werespond, wearethree times more likely tosuffer
serious injury ordeath during this time than wewere in
childhood orthan wewill beinadulthood. This increase in
riskisnot“bychance”—scientists believe itcomes from the
innate changes in how the brain develops during this period.
The question iswhether wecansupport theexploration of
new things while wealso minimize thechance ofpermanent
harm. That’s theissue, andthat’s oneofthechallenges we’ll
address in the pages ahead.
Just before myson’s first birthday, heand Iwere walking
around theblock near ourapartment, gathering stones we
could tossaround (afavorite pastime ofhis), when Inoticed a
line ofcars jammed along what was usually apretty quiet
street. When wegothome, Iheard from some neighbors who
had been stuck inthetraffic that there had been aterrible
accident just a mile from our apartment.
That evening I was horrified to find out what had happened.
Myfavorite teacher during mypsychiatric training program
was pulling outofhisdriveway with hiswife that late
afternoon, headed foraFriday night dinner andamovie. I’ll
call myteacher Bill. (As inallthetrue stories you’ll read
about, I’ve changed thenames andidentifying features ofthe
32

people inthese nonfiction narratives tohonor their privacy
and protect theconfidentiality ofallconcerned—except,
naturally, I’ve leftmyown details and those ofmyfamily
members.) AsBillandhiswife leftfortheevening, hiswife
later toldme,they were excited togoouttogether. Billdrove
hiscartothecorner oftheir residential street, looked both
ways, andwhen thecoast was clear carefully drove hiscar
across thewestbound lanes tohead easttoward therestaurant,
atrip heand hiswife had been taking fornearly ahalf
century. But this time was different. Inthat brief time
crossing over thelanes, acarsuddenly appeared headed west
andbarreled intothem. Before they knew it,their carwashit
head-on, split inhalf, and Bill was killed instantly.
Amazingly, Bill’s wife and thedriver ofthespeeding car
were unharmed, physically at least.
The driver was anineteen-year-old young man ina
brand-new sports car.Two months earlier, after crashing into
atree, hehad been arrested forspeeding down that same
twisty boulevard. Hisparents replaced thatwrecked sports car
with another. Bill’s wife told methattheinvestigators atthe
scene later estimated that theteenager had been driving at
least ninety-five miles anhour. Itraced thepath ofthatteen’s
carinmymind over andover again, trying tomake sense of
thissenseless accident. Atthatspeed andwith those curves,
Billcould never have seen thecarapproach before crossing
those westbound lanes tohead east, andtheoncoming teenage
driver atthatspeed would never have seen Bill’s carcrossing
his path until it was too late.
Ididwhatever Icould tosupport Bill’s family, friends, and
colleagues inthememorial services attheuniversity andat
theclinical institutions where Bill had taught forsomany
33

years. Ireflected onwhat hehadtaught measanexpert in
development andthemind—how ourearly experiences shape
who weare, shape who webecome; how somuch ofour
behavior isdriven bymental processes outside ourawareness.
Justafewweeks before histragic death, BillandIhadmetto
talk about some oftheresearch Iwas starting todoon
attachment and memory. “That’s sofascinating!” Bill said.
“Tell memore!” Hewas such aninspiring teacher, someone
who would listen closely towhat was going oninside me,
support myinterests, encourage metopursue mypassions.
And atthat meeting Itold him so.“Thanks, Dan, butyou
know Ithink ofyou more asapeer now, acolleague.” I
thanked him, and felt honored tobeconnected tohim
however hedefined ourrelationship. Iwondered how Bill’s
lifedevotion toexploring why people dowhat they domight
help all of us comprehend this reckless and fatal accident.
34

35

When Ibegan tolook into thefacts about theadolescent
period, Iwas shocked tofind thatthough teenagers aremore
physically fitand healthier than children oradults, they
actually make upthelargest group with avoidable causes of
death. Byavoidable Imean thatrisky ordangerous behaviors
lead topermanent injuries orfatalities. With accidents, drug
use,wounding from weapons, suicide, andmurder, theperiod
from twelve totwenty-four isthemost dangerous time ofour
lives. Bill’s death fitwith well-established statistics. The
reality is that many teenagers—like this
nineteen-year-old—act inextreme ways that risk life and
limb, harming their own and others’ lives inirreversible
ways.
Why dosuch risk-taking, limit-testing, sensation-seeking
behaviors happen? With myone-year-old sonthere bymy
side around thetime ofBill’s death, Iwondered ifthere was
anything Icould doashisfather toprevent him from
participating insuch destructive behavior. Ifthat was
possible, Iwanted tofigure itoutand share itwith my
patients and themental health community sothat tragedies
like the one that ended Bill’s life might be avoided.
Adolescence isatime ofgreat boundary pushing thatcanbe
challenging and create catastrophes; butthis pushing-back
propensity canalso bearemarkably positive, essential partof
ourlives. Our challenge istoengage and explore ways to
push atlife’s boundaries without driving ahundred miles an
hour down apublic street andkilling someone inourpath.
Formales especially, who seem tobiologically need tocourt
danger, insome fashion to“come ofage” asyoung men, to
testlimits and face risk toprove they cancome outalive,
there must besome culturally sanctioned rites ofpassage we
36

canreinvent that don’t involve atwo-ton weapon barreling
down theroad with innocent victims initswake. When an
adolescent gazelle runs upclose toacheetah toinspect its
potential predator, itisrisking itsown life, notthelifeofits
fellow gazelles, adolescents oradults. Asmodern human
beings who share with other mammals thisadolescent drive
toward danger, carsandalcohol make accidents oneofthetop
killers in this otherwise healthy period of life.
Inthetwenty years since Bill’s death, thetragic school
shootings andpublic explosions webear witness tohave often
been carried outbymales intheir adolescence. There isan
increasing disconnect intoday’s world and weneed todo
something tohelp teens sothatsuch destructive behavior can
be understood and made less likely to happen.
Rather than simply wondering what isgoing on,itwould be
much more productive toexplore thenature ofadolescence
with individuals intheir teens and twenties and with the
adults who help support them insuch away thatmaybe, just
maybe, thechances ofthese destructive actions occurring
might belessened, even ifinsome small butpersonally
significant way. Ithink Billwould behappy ifunderstanding
theadolescent processes leading tohistragic death could help
avoid such tragedies for others in the future.
Pushing Away
Inbroad terms, theadolescent push against what isknown,
safe, and familiar isatwo-sided coin. Yes, that adolescent
pushing away from adults seems tobebuilt into ourgenes.
It’swhat gets ustodrive outrageously fast down apublic
street. That isthedestructive side oftheadolescent coin, a
side weshould trytocontrol sotheadolescent cangrow well
37

andstretch hisorherwings butminimize damage toselforto
others.
Yet there is a constructive side that can be used, too.
With awareness, thepower oftheadolescent mind canbe
utilized tobenefit oneself andothers. Itisthisconstructive
sidethathasledtosomany innovations thathave transformed
ourmodern world inart,intechnology, inmusic. This period
oftheteenage years and early twenties isatime ofgreat
potential andofgreat constructive power. The push against
traditional ways ofdoing things andofthinking about reality
canyield ways ofthinking outside thebox that enable new
and creative ways of doing things to emerge.
With theproblems ourworld faces today—the energy crisis,
changes intheenvironment, overpopulation, war, poverty,
and threats totheavailability ofhealthy food, water, and
air—never before have wesodesperately needed away to
think beyond ourusual strategies tocreate innovative ways of
sustainable living onourprecious planet. Mysuggestion to
you isthat thepower oftheadolescent mind hasjust that
spark ofemotion andsocial drive, justthat push toexplore
new solutions tooldways ofdoing things, thatmay save life
on our planet.
The keyishow todiscover these hidden positive aspects of
adolescence andwork together asadolescents andadults to
make them work for us rather than against us.
Even ifwedon’t buyinto theidea thatadolescents will save
theworld, atleast understanding brain science may help
explain how wecanencourage ateen todecide tocallhome
orcome inbyoneinthemorning instead ofthree. Wemay be
more open tothenotion that brain science shows how the
38

very essence ofadolescence canhelp individuals behealthier
andhappier. Butthetruth, too,isthatthese essential features
also can help improve our planet.
Letmesayhere thatifyouasanadolescent begin tograsp the
science behind thechanges inyour brain during your teenage
years, your adolescence and your adulthood will bebetter.
And ifadults cangain insight into these same fundamental
aspects oftheadolescent mind, they, too,will have healthier
andhappier lives. Wehave alottolearn from theadolescent
mind asitemerges inthese years andabout how wecanhold
ontoitsessence throughout ourlives. Whether you area
teenager oranolder adolescent, oryou areanadult making
sense ofadolescents inyour lifenow orwondering what
happened toyou when you were this age, these essential
features areanimportant part oftheunfolding ofyour
individual life history.
The Timing of Puberty, Sexuality, and Adolescence
Two changes happen universally inourhuman adolescence.
One isthataspuberty hitswebegin toexperience changes in
thebody andchanges inouremotions. Thesecond isthatwe
push away from ourparents, hanging outwith ourpeers more
and trying to do things in new ways.
With puberty, oursexual organs develop andcreate changes
inhormone levels andinoursecondary sexual characteristics,
such asbreasts ingirls andfacial hairinboys. Formany ofus
after puberty, ourfeelings ofsexuality begin toemerge. We
become attracted toothers innew ways that canbeintense,
wonderful, and frightening allatonce. Puberty and sexual
maturation often mark theonset ofadolescence. Forsome
individuals, thebrain changes ofadolescence may occur even
39

before puberty, incases, forexample, ofdelayed sexual
maturation.
Whenever puberty occurs, thenew emerging sexuality gives
rise tofertility—the ability toreproduce. Ahundred years
ago, thetime between theonset ofadolescence andthetaking
onofadult responsibilities ofworking andhaving andraising
children was very short, acouple ofyears. Inthose days,
puberty ingirls happened around agefifteen orsixteen, and
justafewyears later teens would create anew family home.
What haschanged isthat now there isalonger duration
between puberty andthe“end ofadolescence,” atransition
that hasnoclear endpoint. The time forsetting upanew
family andbecoming employed inmany modern cultures can
beadecade ortwo. With theonset ofpuberty now ata
younger agethan ever before—in girls, often before theteen
years—and the later timing ofsetting upahome and
assuming other adult responsibilities, adolescence isnow
quite extended.
While pushing away from adults isuniversal, what also may
beunique tomodern life isthe increasing number of
adolescents who respond tothese challenges bycompletely
excluding adults from their lives. Forboth adolescent and
adult, keeping thelines ofcommunication open isthemost
basic principle of navigating these years well.
Inallcultures throughout theworld theyears thatfallbetween
childhood andadulthood areconsidered adistinct period of
life. Interestingly, scientists have noted that itisamarked
period intheanimal kingdom aswell—dogs and cheetahs,
parrots and finches allexperience adolescence asadistinct
lifestage. It’spossible that this adolescent period, then, is
something encoded in our genetic material; it’s in our genes.
40

Ifwecontinued todothings just like they didinprevious
generations, wewould beusing thesame old-world strategies
that may not work inanew environment created bya
constantly changing world. Bypushing away from adults and
hanging outmore with peers during ouradolescence, wecan
find new ways ofdealing with theworld and create new
strategies forliving. Inthe “adapt ordie” realities of
evolution, adolescents are our adaptive force.
Yetadults sometimes forget their own adolescence andsettle
into thestatus quo, feeling more comfortable with theway
things are.While thatsense offamiliarity inastressed lifeof
adult responsibilities isunderstandable, aswe’ve seen, itmay
alsobeareason why theadult-adolescent relationship isfilled
attimes with tension. Adults desire things tostay thesame;
adolescents aredriven tocreate anew world. This ispart of
thesource ofwhat canbecome intense friction, sometimes
destructively so,thatcancreate pain ineveryone, adolescent
and adult alike.
We’ll explore ingreat detail how ourrelationships shape our
identity aswe move from the important attachment
relationships with ourparents totherelationships webegin to
cultivate more with ourpeers during adolescence. Aswepush
away from adults during adolescence webegin toassociate
much more with peers. Associating with ourpeers during this
time isvital foroursurvival. There issafety innumbers aswe
“leave thenest” andhelp oneanother brave thisnew world.
This increased social engagement also helps uscollaborate
with our peers, with whom we’ll set up a whole new world.
Throughout human history, we stayed together as
communities, with adolescents exploring and establishing
independence while maintaining arange ofimportant and
41

instructive interactions with their adult elders. Those strands
ofconnectedness are being stretched intoday’s world,
sometimes severing them with negative consequences of
isolation andalienation. Wearemeant toliveinacommunity,
meant tolive inconnection with others. Soifthepushing
away from adults leads ateen tobecome isolated even from
hisorherpeer group, then that total disconnection canbe
quite disorienting. Remember, adolescents pushing away
from others isnatural; shutting others outtotally isnothelpful
(nor isitnatural) foranyone. An important take-home
message isthatitisvital tokeep thelines ofconnection and
communication open and to remember that we
all—adolescents and adults—need tobemembers ofa
connected community.
The Stress and Distress of Our Extended Adolescence
Isatrecently with agroup ofolder adolescents andyoung and
older adults tobrainstorm some new approaches toeducation
andtheInternet. Inorder togettheconversation going, we
focused onwhat ourteenage years were like andtook ona
group exercise tooffer one word that captured asense of
those years. Here arethewords these individuals offered to
thegroup: isolated ,crazed ,confused ,amess ,alone ,terrified ,
wild,out of control ,lost,seeking , and frightened .
Imyself offered theword disconnected ,which Ifelt,andright
away Iwondered iftheword wastooabstract, toointellectual,
toodisconnected itself from myown emotional experience or
theirs. Such doubt, aswe’ll seelater on,may beapartofour
temperament, asitiswith me.Buttheadolescent years are
also filled with asense ofuncertainty bynature. Why?
Because thisisatime ofgreat transition. Wemove from the
relative safety andfamiliarity ofthehome nest toatemporary
42

period—one thatmay lastdecades—of having norealhome
base. Soright there wehave tworeasons fordistress: losing
the familiar and safe, and gaining the unfamiliar and
dangerous. You never know what lurks intheworld outside
the home nest, do you?
Infacing such newness, adolescence isatough time. Itcanbe
disorienting, disturbing, discombobulating, and distressing.
Wecanbecome disengaged, disenchanted, anddiscouraged.
Maybe youcanthink ofsome other terms thatdescribe these
“dis-” states, like thefeeling you’ve disappeared orare
dissolving. These arethedistasteful aspects ofthetransition
from dependency andthenest-home lifeofchildhood tothe
come-what-may years that lieahead intheoutside world
before the more settled interdependency of adult life.
One source ofnotjustcomfort butbasic survival istoidentify
more with your peers than with your parents, toconnect with
other adolescents andpush away from adults. Bybeing apart
ofanadolescent group, you getcompanionship onthis
transitional trek, aswell assafety innumbers: Predators will
beintimidated byalarge group, andyoucanlose yourself in
thegroup mass. That isonereason why formany butnotall
teens, fitting incanfeel soimportant—it’s anevolutionary
holdover oflife ordeath. You can feel comforted
bymembership inthegroup, strengthened bymembership in
the group, and even more creative inthe collective
intelligence of the group.
While group collaboration can certainly beasource of
collective intelligence, itcanalso getyoutojump offacliff
ordrive toofast. And that’s probably why some form of
continued connection totheadults andtheir adult perspectives
still exists intraditional cultures, and even inouranimal
43

cousins. Without adults around, young adolescents can
literally go wild.
Inmany cultures theperiod ofadolescence ismarked bya
culturally sanctioned riteofpassage. Forboys, there isoften a
sense ofdanger and actual risk taking, with thesuccessful
completion marked byaceremony welcoming theyouth into
theadult world ofresponsibility. Forgirls, adolescence isa
time ofacknowledgment offertility, theability tobear
children and care forthem, sogirls arewelcomed into the
community asnew members ready tobecome apart ofthe
adult generation. These rites ofpassage are formal
acknowledgments of this important transition in life.
Inmodern culture, ourrites ofpassage areoften missing or
minimized inimportance. Weseem tohave lostmany ofour
communal and sanctioned ways oftaking risks and
acknowledging thetransition from childhood toadulthood.
Human adolescents—and even adolescents ofmany other
mammal species—leave thehome andmove away from those
towhom they aregenetically related. Some argue that the
biological benefits ofsuch geographical migration make
commingling similar genes among ourrelatives less likely.
From agroup point ofview forhumans, there needs tobea
clear separation ofthedependency ofthechild and the
responsibility of the adult.
With alack ofjobs and agreat deal ofuncertainty about
participating in contemporary society, however, the
adolescent period may inmany ways beeven further
prolonged. Because modern cultural practices donotoffer
transitional relationships with non-parental adults tohelp
acknowledge and facilitate theadolescent period, wehave
some major challenges asadolescents inourmodern times.
44

This might besomething wemay want tochange inthefuture
in our evolving cultural practices.
With this perspective, perhaps collectively wecancreate a
cultural rite ofpassage, away inwhich adolescents are
connected tonew adults who can help support them in
risk-taking and novelty-creating experiences that minimize
danger yetoptimize theessence ofadolescence. There isalot
ofpower intheemotional spark ofthisperiod. And with some
adult involvement, the social engagement during this
important time canfuelthedrive fornovelty andthecreative
explorations that emerge. The key ishow wecanallwork
together, across thegenerations, tohonor this essence of
adolescence, todiscover andcultivate thehidden power and
purpose of the adolescent mind.
Adolescent Transitions and the Centrality of Our
Relationships
AsIembark upon thisconversation with you, Iamalso living
these transitions inmyown life. Theweight ofitall,butalso
thebeauty, hitmerecently onthemorning mydaughter was
preparing toleave ustogoofftocollege. Iwant toshare this
experience with you, asIhope itwill speak toyour own
experiences asboth adolescents and parents going through
these changes.
Thesunisrising slowly onanovercast dayhere inthisdesert
citybythesea. LosAngeles iswhere Igrew up,andthisis
where my wife and Ihave raised our two kids—now
twenty-two andeighteen years ofage. Clothes arefolded in
piles along thewalls inthehallway outside ourdaughter’s
room. Iwake early thismorning, restless inbed, tumble outin
45

thehazy light, andstep into thehall that foreighteen years
has been our passage to her room.
Shewas born four andahalf years after herbrother, whose
room, empty since hemoved away tocollege, has long
become therepository ofboxes ofthings tobesorted outand
stored inhiscloset likememories ofyears now past. Alothas
been happening allatonce inourfamily inthepast few
months.
Myfather’s recent passing, thefirst death inourimmediate
family indecades, marks theunfolding ofthegenerations
with afinality that underlines theflow ofthis lifewecall
being human. Life isconstantly changing, continually moving
forward intime, nomatter how much wemay want things to
simply stay asthey are. This isthelastday inourhome
before ourdaughter will take allthose piled clothes, pack
them upinboxes andsuitcases, putthem inherbrother’s car,
and then drive off to college.
Somuch ishappening, allatonce, thatIcan’t seem tograsp
andhold ontoitall.Ithink ofadear family friend, anIrish
poet named John O’Donohue, who died suddenly justafter he
turned fifty-two. John wasanaccomplished, insightful author
andphilosopher, who leftbehind magnificent books onlife
and love. Inaninterview shortly before hisdeath, hewas
asked ifthere wasanything thatstillbothered him, something
hecould notdeal with. John said thatnomatter how much he
thought, nomatter how much hewrote, hehad anagging
feeling thattime waslikefinesand thathecould nothold on
to,however tightly hetried tograsp it—it justranthrough his
fingers.
46

And that’s how Ifeelnow. Somuch happening, somuch life
anddeath andchange, andnomatter what Ido,Ican’t hold
on to any of it. It just slips onward, ever forward.
Tobeaware, toawaken tothemomentous time ofitall,to
feelitsweight, tosense theinevitability ofthese tides oflife,
this flow ofbirth, childhood, adolescence, emergence into
adulthood, transition, illness, death. Tobeaware ofour
dependence onone another, onourindividual development
from theearliest days into maturity—whenever thatactually
is—to alifefilled with discovery, connection, growth, and
then dissolution. When John andIwould teach together, he’d
always laugh andsaythat the“pain level isdropping now”
andthatthe“joy level isrising rapidly” when we’d greet each
other after along time apart. Love fills these moments with
laughter andlight even intheface ofthistransience ofour
being.
When Iwasateen, Ifirst started wrestling with some ofthese
notions oflifeand death, trying tomake sense ofhow we
could live lightly inlifewhile knowing theheaviness ofits
finality. The streets ofthiscity were myplayground, where
I’dridemybike forhours, reflecting onthiswild journey and
how weshould beaware ofthereality ofwhat itmeans tobe
awake, tobehuman. Icame back here after leaving formy
own education, returning tothese streets andtothiscoastal
citywhere theshore meets thesand, letting thewaves ofthe
sea be my companion all these years later.
Our own children have walked those same sandy paths, their
footprints aslight andtemporary asmine decades ago. The
waves washing away oursteps through life, thetides moving
inandoutwith thecycle ofourdays. Their childhood joys,
andsorrows, asrealandalive forthem asthey were then for
47

me,asthey areforeach ofusnow. Nomatter ourage, weare
on this life journey together.
Ifeeltheweight oftime here andnow. Isthisthesadness of
herleaving? The sadness ofmyfather’s dying? Isthissome
sense ofhelplessness attheuncertainty ofitall,oftheonly
certainty inlifebeing change itself? I,too, cannot grasp the
sand inmyhands, cannot stop time from moving forever
forward. I sit here, now, filled with it all.
Ilook atmydaughter’s clothes andIalso seeinmymind’s
eyeayoung toddler’s toys strewn inthissame hallway. Ifeel
therhythm ofthemusic sheandIwould play inherpreschool
years, when onWednesdays I’dtake theafternoon offfrom
work topick herupfrom school and then we’d dance the
afternoon away. We’d twirl intempo, herfeetdancing inair,
mytoes clinging tocarpet asIswung herround andround.
“More ...More ...More!” she’d cryout, and round and
round we’d go, collapsing on the couch, exhausted,
exhilarated, giggling, together.
Icansee,too,anexcited kindergarten kidholding hersweater
asshecarried hershoes downstairs, tiedherlaces justso,and
picked upherlunch boxasshebounded outthefront door. If
patients’ appointments permitted, I’drunhome forherarrival
attheend oftheday and seethat boundless energy of
excitement assherecounted theday’s events. I’dhead back to
work, seeing people intherapy whose attachment totheir own
parents wasoften filled with strife. We’d work tomake sense
oftheir lives, their histories, their struggles. And I’dbe
working tomake sense ofmyown, toembrace theprofound
importance of our relationships with one another.
48

How dowefind abalance between ouradolescents’ personal
decisions andourparental regulation, ourconcerns? Structure
with empowerment ishow mywife andIwould think ofour
strategy ofparenting. How could wesupport ouradolescents
while also allowing them tofind their own voices? And how
atthesame time could wesetthelimits andcautions ourown
years of living had taught us?
Science would call this “authoritative parenting,” ahelpful
approach that isfilled with warmth, limit setting, and
honoring ofautonomy inage-appropriate ways. Such astance
isalso thebalanced approach ofsecure attachment: lending
support while supporting separation. Infact, attachment isall
about thisway inwhich weprovide asafe haven while also
encouraging exploration. Attachment isallabout both
security athome andsecurity intheworld. Wedidourbest to
supply thebasic S’sofattachment, letting ourkids beseen,be
safe,besoothed ,andfeelsecure .Itisfrom thisfoundation of
secure attachment that adolescents can then ride the
white-water rapids ofthistumultuous journey with thebest
hopes of balance and agility.
Since those earliest days raising ourson, after myteacher Bill
hadbeen killed bythatneed-for-speed racing teen, Ialways
thought inthe back ofmy mind that providing secure
attachment would bethebest wecould doasparents tocreate
thekind ofself-awareness inoursonanddaughter thatwould
minimize the chances for such preventable destructive
behaviors. Challenging tocreate inabusy lifebutcrucial. As
ourkids each grew into their own adolescence, thatsecurity
ofchildhood seemed todisappear, onthesurface, and was
replaced with emotional tension, quick reactivity, andsense
ofdisrespect anddisregard. When thestudies came outthat
49

many adolescents experience more distress and negative
emotional states, itmade sense forhow our own kids’
experiences were unfolding during those early teen years.
And asayoung adult student once said tomeabout what he
learned from hisown adolescence, weneed toremember that
teens arechanging alot,andsometimes they’ll beoneway,
with onekind ofidentity, feeling alotandfeeling intensely,
and sometimes they’ll beanother way, feeling nothing and
notinteracting much. “Just letthem bewho they areatthe
time, notwho you expect they should be” was hisgreat
advice.
Fortunately, thetectonic shifts inemotion and identity of
those early adolescent years give risetoamore stable state
for many teens as they leave the middle school years.
High school istheultimate testing ground forsuch balancing
acts ofrelationships, tests ofattachment tousand new
attachments tofriends. Parenting adolescents isan
emotionally challenging task when facing thedecision to
speak ornotspeak, toconstrain orpermit, tohold close in
times ofuncertainty, togive comfort when things don’t go
right. Finding anetwork ofsupportive relationships for
parents seems crucial ingiving usthereflective space to
move through adolescence. When werealize that inour
evolutionary past weraised children collaboratively andclose
family orfriends orother designated andtrusted individuals
inourtribe cared forouroffspring, werealize how unnatural
being isolated asaparent, orasafamily, truly is.When it
comes tovillage lifefortheteen, during thetime heorsheis
pushing against parents, there would beother adults inthe
tribe towhom theteen could turn forsecurity andconnection.
50

Butwhen theonly close adult isyour parent, thenatural way
to go in adolescence is entirely toward other adolescents.
Aswegrow through development, ourneeds forattachment
donotendwhen ourchildhood emerges intoadolescence; we
transfer those needs forsupportive connections with others to
ourfriends and lifepartners. We need tobeseen byour
friends who serve asimportant attachment figures inour
lives; weneed tobesafe with them; weneed tobesoothed by
them; andweneed tofeelsecure with them. Mywife ismy
secure attachment figure, and Iamhers. Weseek comfort
from theother attimes ofstress andinternalize thesense of
theother tobring aninternal sense ofsecurity throughout the
day.
Thelastthree years ofourdaughter’s adolescence hasbeen a
test, forherand forus,inpatience. Aswith herbrother’s
development, thismiddle period ofadolescence feels like a
preparation forphysical departure andemotional separation.
From fifteen toeighteen years old, ourdaughter, like other
teens during thisperiod, hasfound herway from experiencing
life’s moments ofdecision asstruggles forclarity tosensing
them asmoments ofexpressing heridentity. She, and we,
have moved from eyerolls andintense emotional wrestling
over issues ofwhat shewears, how long shestays out, and
what movies shecanseeandwith whom, tofinding amutual
space ofrespect where wecansaywhat weareconcerned
about andshecanstate what sheneeds, what shewants, and
what herthinking isregarding these day-to-day decisions as
well as major life choices.
Ittook awhile, butafter alotoftearful conflicts onallsides,
welearned thatbysaying what was going oninside ourown
minds—what each ofuswas feeling, thinking, hoping for,
51

how wewere seeing things, andwhat wewere hearing—we
could then listen closely totheother’s inner lifeand the
intention behind what often had become simply
proclamations ofaction, ifnotoutright declarations ofwar.
That’s reflection, that’s reflective conversation. Without such
reflective dialogues with oneanother, theexperience ofthese
years would have been so different.
Ourdaughter’s clothes areneatly folded along thewall ofthe
hallway; herplans forthese next twenty-four hours before her
brother drives herand thepacked caruptoschool, where
we’ll flynorth tomeet them, arelaid outandinclude time
spent mostly with herfriends; andIstand here, feetheavy on
thefloor, eyes glued toherdoor, myheart inawe ofher, of
hergrowth, andofwho shehasbecome. Sheisready togo.
Butlikesomany parents atthismoment, Iamnotsosure ifI
am ready to see her leave.
Asparents wecanonly dothebest wecan. Itishelpful to
realize that sometimes, inmore than athird ofusatleast,
there isactive, intentional reflective andrelational work tobe
done tomove from ahistory ofinsecurity toapresent lifeof
security. Such aconscious presence onourpartcanhelp bring
integration intoourchildren’s lives, tobring security tothem
asthey push away and push oninto their adolescence, so
they’ll carry thebest intentions andconnections from usthat
wecanoffer. That isagiftwecangive toourchildren, and
one we can offer to ourselves as well.
The intention, alltheeffort tolive andtolearn andtolove
from theinside out,thatparents cultivate intheir home lives
will indeed provide theformative experiences tohelp our
children thrive asthey livetheir adolescence well andhold on
toitsessence asthey emerge intotheir adult years. Ifyouare

MINDSIGHT TOOLS #1
Seeing and Shaping the Sea Inside
IntheMindsight Tools sections we’ll explore practical ways
youcanstrengthen your mind, make your brain more flexible
andresilient, andimprove your relationships. Aswe’ve seen
inPart I,thechanges during adolescence arenotsomething to
justgetthrough; they arequalities weactually need tohold on
toinorder toliveafullandmeaningful lifeinadulthood. The
practices we’ll dive into will strengthen these essential
qualities of living well throughout our lives.
Inthisfirst practice entry, we’ll focus onwhat Irefer toas
“mindsight.” Mindsight istheability totruly “see” orknow
themind. It’saword Icreated years agoinmedical school
when Ifound that many ofmy professors lacked this
ability—or atleast didn’t exercise itwell with their patients,
ortheir students. Ineeded some word toremind methat
seeing themind, being empathic, compassionate, and kind,
were important inallrelationships, especially the one
between aphysician andapatient. Itturns outthatthegreater
our ability tounderstand theworkings ofour minds, the
healthier ourinternal worlds become. This isbecause when
wefocus ourattention onthemind, it’spossible tobuild
specific circuits inour brains. The mind istruly
“plastic”—changeable through experience—and itispossible
at any age to move it toward greater health and harmony.
Mindsight includes three fundamental skills.
Thefirst isinsight ,theability tosense your own inner mental
life. Insight letsyou know who you arenow, who you’ve
been inthepast, andwho you’d liketobeinthenear future.
54

Insight connects past, present, andfuture andsoitincludes a
mental time-travel ability that cangive you afullandclear
sense of who you are.
The second aspect ofmindsight isempathy ,ortheability to
sense theinner mental life ofanother person. Empathy
enables usto“see” from theother person’s perspective, and
toimagine what it’slike towalk intheir mental shoes.
Empathy isagateway tocompassion andkindness, anditis
also akeytosocial intelligence, asitallows ustounderstand
others’ intentions andneeds sowecaninteract inamutually
satisfying way.
Thethird component ofmindsight isintegration ,theability to
link different parts ofsomething into aninterconnected
whole. Integration enables ustomake our relationships
rewarding as we honor differences and promote
compassionate connections inhow we communicate.
Integration inside ourselves helps uslinkthedifferent aspects
ofmemory together connecting ourpast, present, andfuture
inacoherent way sothat wehave alifestory that makes
sense ofwho weare.Integration also helps uslink different
aspects ofthebrain and body sothat wearehealthy and
function well. Integration creates coordination andbalance in
ourinner andinterpersonal worlds. Integration isthebasis for
living ahealthy life, and sotheskill ofmindsight with its
insight, empathy, andintegration enables ustocreate health
in our bodies, our relationships, and our minds.
The highest region ofthebrain, thecortex, makes “maps” or
patterns offiring neurons—the basic cells ofthenervous
system—that create animage orrepresentation ofvarious
things. The back ofthecortex makes maps ofwhat wesee,
andtheside areas make maps ofwhat wehear. Inthefrontal
55

area wemake many kinds ofmaps, including amap ofpast
events andamap ofpossible future experiences. The most
forward part ofthisfrontal area, theprefrontal cortex, makes
amap ofthemind itself. This ishow wesense andimagine
another person’s feelings, thoughts, andmemories, among the
many aspects ofourmental life.Icallthese “mindsight maps”
because they enable ustoperceive that others have amind
justaswedo.When wesense themind ofanother person, we
aremaking amap inourbrains ofwhat weimagine that
person’s internal mental experience isatthat moment. Itis
thisability tomake maps ofone’s mind andoftheminds of
others that Irefer toasmindsight, animportant skill that
powerfully changes how weunderstand ourselves. Mindsight
isthekey ability atthecore ofboth emotional and social
intelligence. And mindsight issomething that wecanlearn,
and learn well, to make our lives stronger.
Every person hasfeelings andthoughts andmemories. But
having mindsight empowers ustohave apicture, amap ofthe
mind sothat wecan use those feelings, thoughts, and
memories innew andhelpful ways. Forexample, mindsight
enables ustogobeyond “being sad” or“being angry” andto
recognize thatwehave these feelings ofsadness oranger, see
thatthey arenotthetotality ofwho weare,accept them for
what they are,andthen allow them totransform sothey do
not lead to depression or anger and rage.
Amindsight map isakind ofpicture inside ourselves ofour
inner mental life—the feelings and thoughts and
perspectives—of others, or of ourselves.
56

Three Basic Kinds of Mindsight Maps
Wehave mindsight maps ofmeforinsight, sometimes called
self-awareness or self-knowing awareness. We have
mindsight maps ofyou forempathy orother-knowing. We
even have amindsight map ofwefortheway wethink,
imagine, reason, andbehave knowing weareapartofalarger
whole, apartofa“we.” This mindsight map ofweenables us
tolive with morality asweconsider thelarger social good.
57

Insight, empathy, and morality emerge from mindsight
mapping in our brains.
Asteens wecanmake these maps innew andevolving ways.
Themore wegrow ourability tomake these mindsight maps
ofme,you, andwe,thefreer, fuller, andmore flexible our
lives will be.Animportant aspect ofour journey during
adolescence isdeveloping amore intricate way of
understanding ourselves and others.
Mindsight isaskill. Butwedon’t need togotoatraining
camp tostart building thisimportant integrative ability inour
lives. Wecansimply start theregular practice ofreflection
andreflective conversations thatwe’ll explore throughout the
mindsight tools sections. One ofthemost exciting things to
remember aswesetouttolearn these skills isthat science
suggests that such training ofaskill grows connections
among ourneurons thathelp create amore integrated setof
circuits inthebrain. And these integrated circuits support how
webalance our emotions, focus our attention, understand
others and ourselves, approach problems, and interact with
others. This iswhy integration issohelpful tocreate.
Mindsight skills build integration in your brain.
Aswe’ve seen, learning mindsight skills means three things.
One isseeing themind ofoneself forinsight. The second is
seeing theminds ofothers forempathy. And thethird means
moving our own minds and those ofothers toward
integration. That’s mindsight in a nutshell.
Seeing Inside the Sea Inside
When wereflect onthings going oninside us,inourinner
subjective mental life, wedevelop themindsight mapmaking
circuits ofthebrain. That’s right. Aswepractice mindsight
58

skills, weactivate those prefrontal circuits and help them
grow stronger. Since thisregion inthebrain helps coordinate
and balance our inner and interpersonal life, developing
mindsight skills canhelp youunderstand what isgoing onand
help you make what is going on work best.
Buthow does what wedowith ourmind’s awareness, how
webecome conscious ofourown subjective mental lifeand
then make mindsight maps ofourseainside, change the
physical structure ofourbrains? This happens because ofa
process called neuroplasticity, theway thebrain changes its
connections inresponse toexperience. And experience here
means how youfocus your attention. When wepayattention
toourinner mental life, wegrow those important fibers that
help usunderstand ourselves and others. That’s what
mindsight maps candoforus.They help illuminate thesea
inside ourselves and others.
But what is this inner mental sea?
This rich inner world includes your feelings, thoughts,
perceptions, memories, images, and sensations, aswell as
your intentions, attitudes, beliefs, hopes, dreams, anddesires.
Even though that’s along listofinner mental processes, you
canimagine that there areeven more things inourinner
mental seathat wecanbeaware of,like motivations and
longings and impulses.
These mental activities, thecontent ofourmental life, can
occur even without ourbeing aware ofthem. Butwhen we
payattention tothese inner experiences, when weplace them
inawareness, something very important happens. When our
mental lives become something weareaware of,wecan
59

develop themindsight ability tosense thisseainside andto
transform our inner life in a positive direction.
How can mindsight actually change ourmental lives? To
learn how thiscanhappen andtolearn how tomake ithappen
forus,weneed toaskabasic question about what themind
is.Ifthisisatopic that isofspecial interest toyou, please
read anin-depth exploration ofthemind inmyPocket Guide
toInterpersonal Neurobiology ,inwhich Idiscuss ingreat
detail what we’ll discuss inpractical ways here. Ifyou’d like
toexplore how these skills can beused toface various
challenges across thelife span, please see therange of
examples illustrating this approach in my book Mindsight .
What isthemind? There isnosingle answer tothisquestion.
And many science fields actually have noanswer tothis
simple butchallenging query. Odd asthat might seem, it’s
true. Here we’ll explore thepractical applications ofwhat I
think the mind is in ways that I hope will empower your life.
While theterm “mind” isoften used tomean ourinner,
subjective experience oflifeandtheprocess ofbeing aware
orconscious, themind also regulates theflow ofenergy and
information. The mind regulates how energy moves both
within us(embodied energy) and between usand others
(relational energy). And since regulation entails both
monitoring andmodifying, themind tracks andchanges how
thatenergy andinformation flow over time. Arepresentation
ormap shows thepattern ofenergy regarding aspecific
image, memory, orthought inwhat iscalled information
flow.
Recognizing the mind’s role inregulating energy and
information allows ustolearn todirect their flow inapositive
60

way. Inorder tomove inahealthy direction, wemust engage
ourminds inintegration—linking different aspects ofour
inner andinterpersonal worlds into amore harmonious and
functional whole.
Itisimportant tonote that(1)themind affects notjustyour
internal processes, butyour relationships with others aswell,
and(2)themind isaregulatory process thatisself-organizing
inthatitenables ustosense andthen shape how energy flows
within usandwith others. This ishow mental activities are
formed.
What aremental activities, really? What dothey allhave in
common?
Mental activities likefeelings andthoughts canbedescribed
aspatterns ofenergy and information that flow inside us.
Energy comes inmany forms, likelight thatenables ustosee
these words orthesound energy thatweusetohear them. In
thebrain, ions flowing inandoutofthemembranes ofits
basic cells, theneurons, lead totherelease ofchemicals that
allow these neurons tocommunicate with oneanother. That’s
electrochemical energy. Atitsmost basic level, whatever its
form, energy is the capacity to do stuff.
Certain energy patterns have information inthem. When
patterns ofenergy contain information, itindicates that the
pattern means something beyond just thesensation ofthe
energy itself. When Iwrite “Golden Gate Bridge,” thatenergy
ofthelight oftheletters orofthesound waves forhearing the
words isnotthebridge over theSan Francisco Bay. Words
arecarried onenergy patterns, yes, butthey arepatterns that
contain information. Information iswhen energy flow
represents something—it re-presents ittous.And this
61

movement across time, this flow that wearesaying isan
aspect ofthemind, isallabout energy andinformation and
how it changes across time.
Insight enables ustosense this flow ofenergy and
information inside ourselves. How dowesee this inner
world? Webegin with sensing energy andinformation flow
bydirecting ourattention inward. Attention, bytheway, is
defined ashow we direct the flow ofinformation. So
consciously paying attention toourinner mental lifemeans
focusing theinformation ofourminds into awareness. With
awareness, wecanlearn tonavigate ourinternal worlds, to
seeclearly andtomove easily within theseainside. This is
how mindsight empowers ustodevelop more inner
understanding and inner strength.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE A: Insight and SIFTing the Mind
Right now, tryclosing your eyes and simply askyourself,
what amIsensing right now inmybody? You may feel
tension inyour muscles oryoumay sense your heart beating,
your lungs breathing, orsimply awash ofsensations from the
body as a whole.
What images come upinmymind’s eye? Images may take
many forms, including thefamiliar visual ones. Butyoucan
also have images ofsounds andtouch, animage ofatime of
your lifeorsome hope forthefuture. Images may behard
toputinto words, butdon’t worry about that—simply being
aware of these inner mental experiences is what matters now.
And what feelings areinside me? Emotions can involve
bodily sensations, yes, butthey also link ourbodies toour
thoughts, toourmemories, andtoourperceptions. Becoming
aware ofyour emotional feelings canfillyouwith awash of
62

energy thatmay bechallenging toname, which isfine. Just
becoming aware ofyour emotional state isagreat starting
place.
And now, what thoughts are streaming through my
consciousness? It’sfunny, butnoonereally knows exactly
what athought orthinking really is!Sodon’t worry ifit’s
hard todefine what youmean when yousayyouarethinking
this orthat. Some experience aninner voice that they can
hear, others justasense thathasnowords. Itisfinehowever
thoughts emerge; you justneed toletyourself beaware of
whatever comes up for you right now.
This isthebasic way wecanSIFT ourseainside toseewhat
isgoing on.When weSIFT through ourminds, wecheck
inwardly onthesensations, images, feelings, and thoughts
going oninside ourselves atanygiven moment. “Sift” isan
aptterm todescribe theprocess, ofcourse, because allofthe
many sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts that may
come upinawareness areoften connected tooneanother ina
free-flowing process.
Wedon’t need toworry about putting words tothese inner
experiences; simply becoming aware ofourinternal world is
theessential component forthis SIFTing practice. Aswe
become more familiar with it,wecan tryjournaling asa
means for further exploration.
Physical Sight oftheMaterial World Versus Mindsight ofthe
Inner World
Theway weinteract intheworld canbedivided between two
views ofreality, oneaview ofthemind wecallmindsight,
another view intothephysical nature oftheworld ofobjects.
Modern lifeoften depends more onphysical sight rather than
63

onhonoring themental inner view. This lack offocus onthe
inner subjective world isaconcern because notseeing the
mind canlead topeople treating others without respect or
compassion. Since theexperiences wehave shape who we
are,athome with family orfriends, atschool with teachers
andpeers, andinourinteractions with thelarger social world
ofculture and society, how weattend tothose experiences
canpromote mindsight ordiscourage it.Soifmost ofthese
experiences are externally focused, harnessing only our
physical-object perceptual system, then we won’t be
developing ourskills toseeandshape thepersonal world of
our inner and our interpersonal life.
When weclose oneeye, wecanseetheworld inonly two
dimensions. Then, with both eyes open, wecan see in
binocular vision with thethree dimensions thatsurround us.
That shift inperception from 2-D to3-D isasubtle analogy
forhow wemove from object vision tomind vision. When we
have mindsight, weseethemind within ourhuman lives inits
fulldimensions. Without it,ourperception islimited tothe
surface level ofobject-filled physical spaces thatsurround us,
and we do not see the sea inside.
Ionce began working with someone who was inhisearly
nineties, someone I’llcall Stuart, who, sadly, lacked much
mindsight ability. Helived mostly inaflat,physically defined
reality. Stuart was notprepared toface some ofthemany
challenges andchanges inhislifeatthat age, including his
emerging illnesses andthose ofhiswife ofsixty-five years.
Ashehaslearned mindsight skills, hislifehasgotten fuller
andfreer andisnow imbued with adeep sense ofgratitude
and joy.
64

How could Stuart learn anew skill? Byfocusing hisattention,
hecould stimulate theactivity ofhisbrain innew ways. And
when thebrain gets activated, itcanchange theconnections
among neurons inahelpful way. Focusing themind can
change the structure of the brain no matter our age.
Aswemove through life,thebrain canbethedriver incharge
ofwhich direction wetake. ForStuart, thatmeant living ina
flattened world hehadgrown accustomed to.Hisbrain called
the shots. Our brains can create automatic behaviors,
automatic thinking, andautomatic responding. The brain can
runtheshow, forsure. Butourminds cangetourbrains to
fireandgrow innew ways thatwechoose. That sounds pretty
wild, butitistrue. Science hasclearly shown that how we
focus ourattention will grow ourbrains inspecific ways.
Amazingly, when welearn toseeinside theseainside with
more depth, wecanusethemind tochange thebrain toward a
more integrated function and structure. Integration inthe
brain is what creates health and flexibility in our lives.
This isthekeytomindsight’s power. Wecanlearn theskills
thatcanplace usinthedriver’s seatofourlife’s journey. We
candothatbyunderstanding thebrain, aswe’ll seeinPartII,
andbylearning how tousecommunication with others ina
more effective way, aswe’ll seeinPart III.And wecanlearn
theskills ofseeing themind more clearly sothat wemight
shape itinaway wechoose thatcanchange thebrain’s firing
andeven thephysical connections that make upitswiring.
That’s what we’ll bedoing inallofthese mindsight-building
practice entries.
Ifwespend alotoftime learning amusical instrument, that
encourages those activated parts ofourbrains togrow. Ifwe
spend alotoftime focusing ourattention onasport, the
65

regions ofthebrain involved inthat athletic activity will
grow. And likewise, thekinds ofsocial media and video
games weengage inontheInternet will shape ourbrains as
well. Thegood news isthatwith balance, ourbrains canlearn
many skills, notjustone. The keyistofind things welove
and develop those passions inourlives. Taking some time
each daytoseeinside theseainside willhelp usdevelop our
mindsight circuits.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE B:Mindsight Illuminated
Look around where you arenow and locate aninanimate
object, likeachair orarock. Ifyouareoutside, seeifyoucan
notice something moving, likeacloud orastream. Now try
watching people walking down thestreet orinatelevision
program orinaphotograph, andimagine them only asobjects
moving through space, objects without aninternal mental life.
This isyour physical sight that allows you tonotice the
surface features ofobjects. Now turn onyour mindsight and
look atthose same people andimagine what they might be
experiencing in their minds.
Theenergy wereceive from those same images ofthepeople
canbeprocessed inside usintwoways. Wecanseethem as
justimages ofobjects—that’s ourphysical perceptual system
thatmakes amap ofthephysical world intime andinspace.
And wecan turn onthemindsight perceptual system that
enables ustomap themind oftheother person. This ishow
we can “see” or sense the inner mental life of another person.
Ifyou’ve never done much mindsight looking around, this
may benew foryou, soplease bepatient with yourself. If
you’ve already learned abitofthis, there arealways new
skills youcandevelop aswego.And ifyou’ve spent alotof
66

time sensing themind, then thiswill beagreat review and
strengthening of your skills.
Empathy
When weuse our ability tomake mindsight maps of
ourselves, wecallthisinsight. And when weusethissame
ability tosense andrespect theinner mental lifeofsomeone
else, tomake amindsight map ofanother person, thatcanbe
called compassionate understanding orsimply empathy. The
way wecultivate empathy canmake thedifference between a
relationship thatisrewarding forboth people andonethatis
frustrating and unfulfilling.
But what exactly is a relationship?
When youspeak with afriend, youaresending energy inthe
form ofairmolecules moving from you toyour friend. Her
eardrum picks upthat energy and thenerve inher ear
translates that energy ofair molecules moving into
electrochemical energy thatstreams now intothebrain itself.
The patterns ofthat energy flow contain within them
information that stands forthesounds you aresending, the
words that have meanings attached tothem. Because you
speak thesame language, your friend gets theinformation in
theenergy patterns you’ve sent. That energy andinformation
flow shared between people isreally how wecommunicate
with each other.
Soarelationship canbedefined asthesharing ofenergy and
information flow.
When thatsharing includes information about themind itself,
when you areinterested inwhat isgoing onwithin thesea
inside your friend, you areattuning toherinner life. That
67

attunement ishow youcreate amindsight map ofherinside
you. And that is the essential aspect of empathy.
Instead ofsimply responding tothephysical things someone
does intheir behavior, mindsight enables youtomap outthe
inner mental lifeofyour friend revealed bytheir physically
sent signals, bytheir communication. Mindsight enables you
to sense the mind that is creating the behavior.
You may have noticed that there arethree elements to
relational communication. One issensing what isgoing on
between youandanother person. Asecond isbeing intouch
with what isgoing oninside you, orinsight. Theother iswhat
isgoing oninside another person, orempathy. For the
“between” sense ofyour relationship, you can feel how
communication ishappening between you and another
person. This means that signals being sent match what is
being received. Does someone hear what you arereally
saying? Ishepaying attention toyouorishedistracted? Ishe
trying tomake sense ofwhat you say? And isthis friend
making aninner map ofwho youareandofyour mind, not
justwhat your behavior is.When wefeelthatanother person
feels our feelings, that can becalled “feeling felt.” This
feeling isoneofthemost important aspects ofaclose and
supportive relationship.
Ontheempathy side ofrelationships, wecanmap outthose
internal mental experiences weimagine aregoing onfrom
what wearereceiving assignals from other people. These
signals include what they saywith words andwhat non-verbal
signals arebeing communicated. These non-verbal signals
include eyecontact, facial expressions, tone ofvoice, posture,
gestures and touch, and timing and intensity ofresponses.
Such nonverbal signals areoften adirect clue astowhat is
68

happening inthemind before andbeneath theworld ofwords.
Paying close attention tothese signals canbeakeytomaking
mindsight maps of another’s mind.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE C: Empathy
Focusing onnon-verbal signals cangive usafeeling inside
that may bedifficult todescribe with words, butitisan
important way ofturning onourmindsight circuits. Afun
practice istotryturning offthesound onatelevision show or
film and seeing ifyou can soak inthe feelings being
conveyed bythenon-verbal signals onthescreen. Try a
foreign film inalanguage you don’t understand, without
subtitles, andleave thesound onsoyoucanalso take inthe
tone ofvoice ofthecharacters inthestory. Justletyour mind
SIFT theimagined world ofthecharacter, exploring inyour
own mindsight mapmaking view what thesensations, images,
feelings, and thoughts might beofthecharacters ineach
scene. Don’t worry about how accurate youare.Justinviting
yourself toimagine themind ofanother person activates those
prefrontal regions inyour brain thatwillbecome strengthened
bysuch aperspective-taking practice asyoutrytoseethrough
the mental lens of another person.
Integration
Mindsight isnotonly theability tosense theinternal seaof
others with empathy orofourselves with insight; mindsight
also cultivates integration, askill that empowers usto
coordinate and balance theinternal world ofothers orof
ourselves, and the relationships we have with one another.
What does integration really mean, andwhy does itcultivate
clarity from confusion, calm from chaos?
69

Integration isthelinkage ofdifferent parts ofsomething.
When weintegrate within arelationship, forexample, we
honor differences between ourselves and theother person.
Then we promote linkage through compassionate
understanding and communication. Inthebrain, integration
happens when wehonor thedifferences between ourhigher
andlower regions andthen linkthem, orbetween ourleftand
right sides, and then link them.
When weareintegrated, asystem such asarelationship ora
nervous system with itsbrain andwhole body moves into a
flexible and harmonious flow. Integration creates harmony.
Integration iscreated asparts ofasystem areallowed tobe
unique andspecialized, likeyouandmeinarelationship or
like members ofachoir singing inharmony. The
differentiated parts retain their unique aspects andthey also
become linked. Theleftandright sides ofthebrain work ina
coordinated and balanced manner, and thecommunication
between you and me honors differences and promotes
compassionate connection so our relationship flourishes.
Ifeither differentiation orlinkage does not occur, then
something very specific happens. When integration is
blocked, asystem moves toward oneorboth oftwopossible
extremes: chaos on the one hand, and rigidity on the other.
Ithink ofthis like ariver. The central flow isone of
integration andtheharmony itcreates. One bank outside this
central harmonious flow ischaos; theother isthebank of
rigidity. When things arechaotic, they areoutofcontrol,
wild, overwhelming, completely unpredictable. And when
things arerigid, they arestuck, unchanging, boring, and
completely predictable. Life hasanatural movement toward,
rather than getting stuck on,thebanks ofchaos andrigidity as
70

wewind our way down theriver oflife, theriver of
integration.
Theriver ofintegration represents themovement ofasystem
across time. When thesystem isintegrated, itisadaptive and
harmonious initsfunctioning. When linkage ofthe
differentiated elements (integration) does not occur, the
system moves torigidity orchaos, orsome combination of
both. From Daniel J.Siegel, M.D., Mindsight: The New
Science ofPersonal Transformation ,copyright ©2010 by
Mind Your Brain, Inc. Adapted with permission.
You may beasking, “Where does thisintegration take place?”
And you may be wondering what exactly is being integrated.
71

Great questions. Integration takes place inside you and
between youandothers. This iswhere themind is—within us
and between us.The mind isboth embodied and itis
relational. Sowhat isbeing integrated? The core elements of
the mind as we’ve been defining it: energy and information.
Theprocess ofmindsight hasinsight inwhich welook inward
andhonor ourdifferentiated experiences andlinkthem within
awareness. Mindsight includes empathy with which wehonor
ourdifferences with others and make maps ofourminds
within our own differentiated self. That’s linking
differentiated parts within anempathic relationship. And so
wecanseehow insight and empathy naturally support the
third fundamental power ofmindsight topromote integration.
Where? Within and between.
Now here’s another amazing finding. People who usetheir
minds toreflect ontheinner nature oftheir mental lives grow
circuits inthebrain that link widely separated areas toone
another. This linkage, called “neural integration,” creates the
coordination andbalance ofthenervous system. Another term
thatsome researchers often useforthisis“self-regulation.” In
thenervous system, regulation iscreated through neural
integration. And notonly canpeople who develop theskill of
mindsight promote self-understanding and empathy, they
create integration and regulation within themselves, within
their relationships, and within others.
Ifweactively useourattention toexplore theinner world, we
canbegin toseehow mindsight canhave positive effects that
help make life,especially during adolescence, amore positive
experience.
72

Aswe’ll seeinthenext part, adolescent brain growth isall
about increasing levels ofneural integration. Sowith these
practices that cultivate mindsight, we’ll actually becreating
more integration in our own brains and in those of others!
When welearn tousemindsight skills, welearn tofocus our
attention inaway thatgrows theimportant fibers inthebrain
thatlinkwidely differentiated areas tooneanother. You may
seethisrepeating idea here: Mindsight isaway offocusing
attention that integrates thebrain! And that’s why learning
mindsight skills issuch anempowering thing forustodoat
any age.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE D:Sensing the Harmony of
Integration
Forthispractice, you’ll belearning todetect various states of
integration. When arelationship you have with another
person, oreven with yourself onagiven day, isworking well,
canyou sense thefeeling ofconnection you have? Try to
observe how astate ofharmony hasthequalities ofbeing
flexible, adaptive, connected, energized, andstable. Ifyouare
considering your connection with another person, seeifyou
can sense how your differences are being honored and
compassionate communication isbeing cultivated between
you. Ifyouarefocusing onyour own inner life, then seeifat
this harmonious time you’ve enabled different aspects of
yourself toberespected andthen linked byhow you’ve given
time forthevarious needs youmay have. Forexample, inmy
own life, I,likemany people, have different states ofmind,
different “parts” ofmyself thathave different needs. One part
likes being social while another distinct part really loves and
needs solitude. What canIdo? Itisliterally impossible to
satisfy mydifferentiated needs allatthesame time. Sothe
73

solution tocreate harmony inmylifeistosetouttime during
theday when each oftheconflicting needs can bemet
separately. That coordination and balance ofmy various
needs create adeep sense ofbeing flexible, adaptive,
connected, energized, andstable inside me.Ifapart ofyou
likes acronyms asmuch asIdo,youmight enjoy noticing that
this collection ofwords can spell FACES. And itisthis
FACES flow that describes an integrated harmonious state.
When Integration Is Not Present: Chaos or Rigidity
Mindsight enables ustonot only detect integration and
harmony butalso feelwhen integration isnotoccurring. We
each canhave moments oflosing ourtemper; ofsaying things
weshouldn’t say, ofreacting inanegative and sometimes
hurtful way. We are allhuman. The key toliving an
integrated life istoembrace thehuman reality ofthese
moments ofimpaired integration andmake arepair, totake
responsibility for what we’ve done, acknowledge those
actions, and move toward amore integrated way ofbeing
back onahigh road andrepair theconnection toothers andto
ourselves. When werealize, asdomany people inworkshops
Iteach, orpatients Itreat, orfriends Iknow, that feeling
disconnected feels badandmaking areconnection feels good,
these feelings letusknow theinner sense ofharmony that
emerges with integration. When your system—which isyour
body and itsbrain, and itisyour relationships—honors
differences andpromotes linkages, when itcreates integration
within usandbetween us,thatistheharmony ofintegration.
And that feels good.
When theenergy and information flow that isinchaos or
rigidity inthis non-integrated state arenot brought into
balance, our inner and interpersonal worlds arenotvery
74

pleasant, tosaytheleast. Inwardly wecanfeellikewe’ve lost
ourminds. Interpersonally wecan feel outofcontrol and
terrify notonly others butourselves aswell. These abrupt
emotional explosions arewhen we’ve “flipped ourlids” or
“gone down thelowroad.” Theactions thatcanhappen down
thelowroad arenotnecessarily “the realperson revealed,” as
some people argue. They aretheolder areas ofthebrain, our
primitive mammalian circuits and oldreptilian brains, as
we’ll seeinPart II,thatarenow acting without theoversight
of the prefrontal region.
Forsome people, thetime between atriggering event andthe
lowroad canbeshort. Those people need towork toidentify
theinternal cues thatreveal thelowroad process isstarting.
Forothers, thetime between islonger, buttheawareness that
aprocess isunfolding, leading totheimpairment ofthe
prefrontal cortex andflipping ourlids, isjustnotaccessible.
Inretrospect, thetrigger canbeunderstood butnotasitis
happening.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE E: Name It to Tame It
Repair ofdisintegrated low-road states starts with the
self-reflection ofmindsight. What was thetrigger? What is
themeaning ofthathotbutton issue foryou? What were the
signs that letyou know something was being triggered in
you? Once down thelow road, didyou take abreak andif
possible leave the scene? Could you feel your way to
lowering your nervous system’s chaotic flooding orrigid
shutting down? Drinking aglass ofwater, stretching, getting
some fresh air,moving around theroom areallways of
changing your present state of agitation or withdrawal.
75

Ofcourse ifyouaretherecipient ofsuch low-road states, in
thatmoment there may belittle youcandoexcept toremove
yourself from asituation. Out oftheheat ofthemoment, it
may beextremely useful toname thisprocess “low road” or
“flipping out.” These are reactive states, farfrom the
receptive state weneed totruly connect with others. And so,
even stating that“Iamreactive now, Ineed ashort break” is
better than simply exploding.
Inthebrain, naming anemotion can help calm it.Here
iswhere finding words tolabel aninternal experience
becomes really helpful. Wecancallthis“Name ittotame it.”
And sometimes these low-road states cangobeyond being
unpleasant and confusing—they can even make life feel
terrifying. Ifthat isgoing on,talk about it.Sharing your
experience with others can often make even terrifying
moments understood and nottraumatizing. Your inner sea
and your interpersonal relationships will allbenefit from
naming what isgoing onandbringing more integration into
your life.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE F:Detecting Chaos orRigidity
and Balancing the Mind
Trytorecall atime when your lifebecame filled with chaos
orrigidity. This may have been within some interaction with
another person inwhich youfeltthechaos ofbeing flooded
with anemotion, likeanger orsadness orfear. Oritmay have
been atime ofrigidity, inwhich some repeating thought kept
atyouwithout changing, oryou feltyourself withdrawing
from interactions with others. Ifthis memory isabout a
specific incident, canyoudetect anytriggering event thatmay
have been apart ofanon-integrated experience? Was
differentiation notoccurring, such assomeone was insisting
76

onthings being done their way and notrespecting your
viewpoint? Orwas linkage absent, such asbeing ignored,
misunderstood, orexcluded? Notice how such blockages to
integration put you in a period of chaos or rigidity.
Ifsuch atime was more extended, trytosense what might
have been going oninyour lifethen, when you may have
been inarigid, unchanging state offeeling bored ordown in
thedumps. Orchaos may have been your extended state,
flooding you with emotions orthoughts orimages or
memories out ofyour control. Try tosense how some
fundamental integration may have been missing atthat time
ofyour lifeandhow you tried topull yourself outofthose
uncomfortable states.
The key tothis practice istofirst detect chaos orrigidity.
Next youcanexplore what aspect ofyour lifemay have been
non-integrated inthat itwas notenabling differentiation or
linkage tooccur. One simple practice totrywhen you feel
distressed bythememory ofthischaotic orrigid time istodo
thefollowing physical positioning ofyour hands. When the
memory ofsome chaotic orrigid time isinthefront ofyour
mind, tryplacing onehand onyour chest—over your heart
region—and oneover your abdomen. Place asmall amount of
pressure from each hand and seehow you feel. Now try
moving thehand onyour chest tothebelly, and theother
hand now uptoyour chest. Apply some gentle pressure and
simply notice how you feel. Now place your hands inthe
positions thatfeltthebest. What doyounotice? Didyoufeel
acalming sensation? Could you tellthedifference between
left on top or right on top?
I’ve offered thispractice tomany people inworkshops with
some fascinating results. Forreasons wedon’t yetunderstand,
77

thispositioning ofthehands onthebody iscalming forthe
majority ofindividuals who tryit.And about three-quarters of
people prefer theright hand over thechest, one-quarter the
lefthand. This preference seems tobeindependent ofwhether
theperson isright- orleft-handed. Ididasmall study ofone
subject, showing thatformethismovement (I’m aleft-on-top
person) created more integration, more coordination and
balance, inmy nervous system asassessed bysome
physiological monitoring ofmy heart. One possibility
suggested bythissingle-person “study” isthattheprefrontal
region isactivated tobalance thebrakes andaccelerator of
ourbodies—the parasympathetic andsympathetic branches of
theautonomic nervous system—and then soothes theheart
andcreates thestate ofcalm inourminds, aswe’ll seemore
inPart II.Though wedon’t yetknow exactly how orwhy this
practice works, forsomany itishelpful tobring calming
within, andsoIinvite you tousethiswhenever your inner
world becomes stuck onthose banks ofchaos orrigidity
outside the flow of integrative harmony.
InPartIIwe’ll dive intothebrain’s functions andhow wecan
understand how topromote integration toachieve these
balanced states. Then, inPart III,we’ll explore how our
attachment relationships may have shaped integration during
ourdevelopment sothatwecanbecome familiar with ways to
make more harmony outofchaos and rigidity inourlives
now.
Mindsight Strengthens the Mind, the Brain, and Our
Relationships
Aswemove through these various practice entries, we’ll be
building theskills ofmindsight tosupport thedevelopment of
insight, empathy, andintegration inourlives. Since themind
78

isboth within usandbetween usandothers—it isembodied
anditisrelational—then wecanseehow knowing about our
body’s brain and knowing about ourrelationships areboth
fundamental tostrengthening ourminds. Inthepages that
follow, we’ll find important concepts that can help bring
integration into ourinner lives and ourinterpersonal lives.
That’s using mindsight tocreate astrong lifeforourselves
from the inside out.

PART II
Your Brain
Aseventeen-year-old senior inhigh school, Katey looked
terrified asherstomach was being pumped inthelocal
hospital emergency room after anight ofheavy drinking. She
was writhing inpain from theemetic-induced vomiting, and
stilldrunk from theseven shots oftequila andfour glasses of
wine shehadconsumed atanend-of-summer gathering that
evening. Atleast that was herparents’ version ofwhat had
occurred based onwhat Katey’s friends hadtold them. For
her part, Katey couldn’t remember much ofwhat had
occurred that evening.
Asitturns out, Katey brought thehard liquor totheparty,
shared itwith herclassmates, andeven coaxed thehost ofthe
event—the daughter ofthedirector oftheir school—into the
drinking spree. Katey wasexpelled from school thefollowing
week, which was theweek shecame inforherfirst therapy
session. Inspeaking more with herabout what happened, I
learned thatshehadplanned to“have fun” attheparty even
though it was at the home of the director of her school.
Katey knew how “off” it all sounded.
“What were youthinking before thatparty?” Iasked her.She
looked sheepish, glancing away with thebeginnings ofa
smile appearing onherface. “What didyou think might
happen after theparty when theschool rules state thatthere is
‘zero tolerance’ foralcohol atschool-related functions?”
Katey looked atme, hereyes wide open and locked with
mine, herhalf-smile widening, suggesting that perhaps her
80

anxiety was increasing orthatshewas somewhat amused at
the whole situation.
“Well ...”shebegan, hersmile now wide across herface. “I
didthink about it.”Shepaused andlooked around theroom as
ifsomeone might belistening, andthen sheturned back to
me. “Iknew what might happen, Iguess, butthefunof
getting completely smashed atthedirector’s own house just
seemed liketoomuch toturn down.” Hereyes shone with a
sparkle of delight.
The fact that Katey herself admitted that shehad“planned”
what would happen attheparty even intheface ofknowledge
about thepotential outcomes resonates inrecent studies
revealing thatteenagers usually have awareness oftherisks of
potentially dangerous behaviors. Asteens weareoften not
oblivious tothe negative consequences ofour actions .
Instead, even though the negative consequences—the
cons—are fully known, weplace more emphasis onthe
potential positive aspects—the PROS—of anexperience: the
thrill, theshared experience, thefun, theexcitement of
breaking therules. That emphasis onthepositive, wenow
know, isaresult ofshifts inthebrain’s structure andfunction
during the adolescent period.
Dopamine, Decisions, and the Drive for Reward
Katey’s enhanced focus onthepositive was infactanatural
consequence oftheincreased reward drive intheadolescent
brain. Thebrain isacollection ofcells thatcommunicate with
oneanother using chemicals called neurotransmitters. During
adolescence there isanincrease intheactivity oftheneural
circuits utilizing dopamine, aneurotransmitter central in
creating ourdrive forreward. Starting inearly adolescence
81

andpeaking midway through, thisenhanced dopamine release
causes adolescents togravitate toward thrilling experiences
andexhilarating sensations. Research even suggests that the
baseline level ofdopamine islower—but itsrelease in
response toexperience ishigher—which can explain why
teens may report afeeling ofbeing “bored” unless they are
engaging insome stimulating and novel activities. This
enhanced natural dopamine release can give adolescents a
powerful sense ofbeing alive when they areengaged inlife.It
canalso lead them tofocus solely onthepositive rewards
they aresure areinstore forthem, while failing tonotice or
give value to the potential risks and downsides.
The brain’s increased drive for reward inadolescence
manifests inteens’ lives inthree important ways. One is
simply increased impulsiveness ,where behaviors occur
without thoughtful reflection. Inother words, impulse inspires
action without anypause. Pausing enables ustothink about
other options beyond theimmediate dopamine-driven impulse
pounding onourminds. Telling thatimpulse tochill outtakes
time andenergy, soit’seasier justnottodoit.This said, with
thedrive forreward stronger and more pressing than ever
when we are teens, taking the time needed for
processing—for reflection andself-awareness—becomes very
important. Ifany notion turns immediately into anaction
without reflection, weareliving ourlives allgaspedal andno
brakes. This can bevery stressful foradolescents and the
adults who care for them.
The good news isthat such impulses canbeputonhold if
certain fibers inthehigher part ofthebrain work tocreate a
mental space between impulse and action. Itisduring the
time ofadolescence thatthese regulatory fibers begin togrow
82

tocounteract therevved-up “go” ofthedopamine reward
system. The result isadecrease inimpulsivity. This is
sometimes called “cognitive control” and isone important
source ofdiminished danger andreduced risks asadolescents
develop. Aswe’ll seeshortly, there areways toenhance the
growth ofthose regulatory fibers thatcreate apause, andthey
can be developed at any age.
Asecond way inwhich increased dopamine release affects us
during adolescence isthe documented increase inour
susceptibility toaddiction. Allbehaviors andsubstances that
areaddictive involve therelease ofdopamine. Asteens not
only arewemore likely toexperiment with new experiences,
wearealso more prone torespond with arobust dopamine
release thatforsome canbecome partofanaddictive cycle. A
drug, alcohol forexample, canlead torelease ofdopamine,
andwemay feel compelled toingest beer orwine orhard
liquor. When thealcohol wears off,ourdopamine plummets.
Wethen aredriven tousemore ofthesubstance thatspiked
ourdopamine circuits. Studies reveal that foods with ahigh
glycemic index—those, like processed foods oreven the
simple carbohydrates ofpotatoes orbread, thatlead toarapid
rise inblood sugar—can alsolead torapid rises inour
dopamine levels and activity inthereward circuits ofthe
brain. Sadly, intheUnited States such addiction tofoods with
high caloric but low nutritional value isthought tobe
responsible for the dangerous epidemic ofobesity in
adolescents, amedical crisis created and reinforced byour
society’s supplying uswith justthistype ofaddictive food.
Aswith anyaddiction, wecontinue toengage inthebehavior
despite knowing itsnegative impacts onourhealth. That’s the
power of the dopamine reward centers.
83

Athird type ofbehavior shaped bytheincreased reward
drives ofthe adolescent brain issomething called
hyperrationality .This ishow wethink inliteral, concrete
terms. Weexamine justthefacts ofasituation anddon’t see
thebigpicture; wemiss thesetting orcontext inwhich those
facts occur. With such literal thinking, asadolescents wecan
place more weight onthecalculated benefits ofanaction than
onthepotential risks ofthat action. Studies reveal that as
teens weareoften fully aware ofrisks, and even attimes
overestimate thechance ofsomething bad happening; we
simply putmore weight ontheexciting potential benefits of
our actions.
What happens with hyperrational thinking isnotalack of
thought orreflection ashappens with impulsivity, andit’snot
amatter ofmerely being addicted toaparticular behavior or
something weareingesting. Instead, this cognitive process
comes from abrain calculation thatplaces alotofweight on
thepositive outcome and not much weight onpossible
negative results. Byweight Imean thattheevaluation centers
ofthebrain downplay thesignificance ofanegative outcome,
while atthesame time they amplify thesignificance given to
apositive result. The scales thatteens usetoweigh outtheir
options arebiased infavor ofthepositive outcome. PROS far
outweigh the cons, and quite simply, the risk seems worth it.
This positively biased scale canbeactivated especially when
teens hang outwith other teens orbelieve their friends will
somehow observe their actions. The social and emotional
context weexperience asteens sets thestage forhow our
brains will process information. While that’s true forany
person whatever their age, theinfluence ofpeers isespecially
strong during adolescence.
84

Inother words, inKatey’s situation herbrain focused onthe
rewarding images ofthethrill, thecore ofsensation seeking,
and shedisregarded thepotential negatives. The emotional
meaning ofheractions waswoven together with herability to
plan andshehyperrationally calculated that thiswas aPRO
thing todo. Katey’s behavior was not impulsive—she
planned her evening long ago in a hyperrational way.
Asourteen years unfold, wemove from theliteral thinking of
hyperrationality tothebroader considerations called “gist
thinking.” With gistthinking, weconsider thelarger context
ofadecision anduseintuition toaimforpositive values we
care about rather than focusing primarily ontheimmediate
dopamine-driven reward.
Soasyoucansee,itisnotassimple assaying thatteens are
just impulsive. And it’salso notassimple assaying, “Oh,
raging hormones,” asissometimes stated. Research suggests
that risky behaviors inadolescence have less todowith
hormonal imbalances than with changes inour brain’s
dopamine reward system combined with the cortical
architecture that supports hyperrational decision-making
creating thepositive bias that isdominant during theteen
years.
When your dopamine circuitry isturned way up,it’slikean
amplifier with itsgain turned up.Enhanced dopamine release
drives ustoward reward andsatisfaction. The gain isturned
upforhow attention isdrawn tothePROS, putting usatrisk
of deemphasizing the cons during these years.
Hyperrationality canbeillustrated intheextreme example of
Russian roulette, agame played with one bullet and six
chambers ofapistol. You have five outofsixchances to
85

make the$6million offered toyouifyouwin. That means,
overall, ifhundreds ofpeople play thisgame, then theaverage
youaremost likely toget,statistically winning fiveoutofsix
times, isfive-sixths of$6million, which is$5million overall.
Let’s goforit!Theproblem is,ofcourse, ifyouaretheonein
six, you aredead. And forthat one person insix, itisa
hundred percent certain that lifeisover. You can seethe
challenge. Itistrue that“most likely” you’ll getmillions of
dollars. Ifyour brain circuits focus onthatpositive outcome,
thePROS, andminimize thesmaller chance oftherisk, the
cons, you’ll take part intheactivity. “Why not?” Yes, that
seems like math gone mad. But tonot jump into this
probability assessment, thetrap of“What ismost likely to
happen soI’lldoit,”requires agutfeeling, theintuition that
isthebasis ofgistthinking, thatliftsyououtofhyperrational
calculations. With development andthegrowth ofthebrain, a
gutfeeling rises andwegetafeeling thattheRussian roulette
game makes no sense.
Paradoxically, intuition plays avery important roleinmaking
good decisions. This isbecause ourintuitions, orgutfeelings
andheartfelt sensations, tend tofocus onpositive values, like
thebenefit ofstaying inschool ordriving atthespeed limit or
keeping fit.Many teens can betoorational, and need to
incorporate the non-rational input oftheir intuitive gut
feelings andheartfelt sensations, feelings thatenable them to
focus onpositive values versus mythical rewards that, in
reality, areoften justoutofreach. Learning toexperience life
from this standpoint isnotabout inhibiting impulses like
driving fastoreating junk food, butrather about embracing
positive goals thatintuitively mean something tous.Katey’s
behavior was not impulsive and itwas not intuitive or
gist-like. Itwas dopamine-driven and hyperrational. She
86

needed towork onbeing more aware ofwhat herintuitive gut
andheart feelings could tellherabout thepotential downsides
to reckless behavior.
Family, Friends, and Fooling Around
Another important factor thatcontributed toKatey’s decision
making isthat she was quite preoccupied with how her
friends would react ifshepulled thisescapade off,literally,
under theschool director’s nose, andwith hisdaughter, no
less! Here weseeanother aspect oftheteenage brain. Ontop
oftheemotional spark anddrive forthereward ofnovelty,
intense social engagement with peers isalso part ofthe
essence ofadolescence. Unfortunately, risk behaviors often
significantly increase inthe company ofpeers, as
demonstrated inexperiments that have measured how teens
dowhen driving onasimulated automobile program when
alone and when with their friends.
Myson’s friend Benji, now inhismid-twenties, tells thestory
ofwhen helived insouthern Spain with hisfamily asa
thirteen-year-old. Ahalf-dozen boys ofthesame agewere
running around thecliffs near thebeautiful coastal town
where hewas staying. One ofthelocals decided tojump the
fifty feetorsoofftheedge ofthecliff andintothesea.Then,
onebyone, thegroup dynamics lured each ofthem tojump.
When Benji jumped, hemay have been justafewfeetover
from where theothers entered thewater, hetold me, or
perhaps itwas because none ofthe local boys had
remembered totellhim, asapparently they knew, that he
ought tobend hislegs right after entering thewater. Straight
inhewent, hurtling toward thebottom and hitting arock
beneath the surface, severely fracturing his right leg.
Struggling tothesurface with theshock ofsuch acrushing
87

injury, hewas losing consciousness when hewas rescued by
two oftheboys andcarried amile back tothetown tobe
hospitalized formuch ofhisremaining time inSpain that
summer. Ifthose boys were notthere inthewater, Benji
would not have been telling me the story.
Iasked Benji ifhethought hewould have jumped ifhewas
on his own. “Are you out of your mind?” he said. “No way.”
The collective process ofbeing with ourfriends, oreven
imagining theimpact onourfriends, asinKatey’s planning
stage ofherescapade, increases thedrive toward reward, the
drive toward novelty, andthedrive totake risks, andthese
reduce thefocus onweighing thepotential risks. Sowith
peers wearemuch more likely asteenagers toengage in
behaviors that may work outmost ofthetime, butifthey
don’t, they may have serious, sometimes irreversible,
consequences. Benji’s and Katey’s behaviors were not
impulsive. They both hadplenty oftime toseewhat was in
the offing and change course. Their decisions were a
combination ofreward drive, peer process, andhyperrational,
non-gist thinking. That’s the nature ofrisky behaviors
emerging from the teenage brain.
Sothetwo broad ways that risky behavior emerges in
adolescence arehyperrationality, thedownplaying ofthecons
ofanaction, andimpulsivity, orsimply flying offthehandle,
aswe’ll discuss later. Katey didnot,andgenerally does not,
show atendency tobeimpulsive. Neither does Benji. In
Katey’s case, thisiswhat drove herparents mad when they
picked her up. Katey isnot impulsive, sowhy such a
seemingly impulsive act?
88

Hyperrationality combined with anincrease inherdopamine
drive isthecause. And sometimes there areother things at
play, such asthedopamine-dependent onset ofaddiction, that
arenotlimited tobeing anadolescent butmay also be
influencing such behaviors, aswe’ll discuss forKatey and
adolescents ingeneral regarding drug useandabuse inPart
IV.
The Purpose of Adolescence
Inrecent years, surprising discoveries from brain imaging
studies have revealed changes inthestructure andfunction of
thebrain during adolescence. Aswe’ve seen, interpretations
ofthese studies lead toavery different story than theold
raging-hormone view oftheteenage brain. Acommonly
stated butnotquite accurate view often presented bythe
media isthatthebrain’s master control center, theprefrontal
cortex, attheforward part ofthefrontal lobe, issimply not
mature until theendofadolescence. This “immaturity” ofthe
brain’s prefrontal cortex “explains immature teenage
behavior.” And this notion also explains why rental car
companies generally won’t letsomeone younger than
twenty-five take outacar.Butthissimple story, while easy to
grasp, isnotquite consistent with theresearch findings and
misses an essential issue.
Instead ofviewing theadolescent stage ofbrain development
asmerely aprocess ofmaturation, ofleaving behind
outmoded ornon-useful ways ofthinking andtransitioning to
adult maturity, itisactually more accurate andmore useful to
seeitasavital andnecessary part ofourindividual andour
collective lives. Adolescence isnotastage tosimply getover,
itisastage oflifetocultivate well. This new andimportant
take-home message, inspired bythe emerging sciences,
89

suggests that thechanges that occur intheadolescent brain
arenotmerely about “maturity” versus “immaturity,” but
rather are vitally important developmental changes that
enable certain new abilities toemerge. These new abilities, as
we’ve discussed, arecrucial forboth theindividual andour
species.
Why should thismatter tous,whether weareteens, inour
twenties, orolder? Itmatters because ifweseetheadolescent
period asjustatime towade through, atime toendure, we’ll
miss outontaking very important steps tooptimize the
essence ofadolescence. When weseeouremotional spark,
oursocial engagement, ournovelty seeking, andourcreative
explorations aspositive and necessary core aspects ofwho
adolescents are—and who they might become asadults if
they cancultivate these qualities well—this period becomes a
time ofgreat importance thatshould benotjustsurvived but
nurtured.
Yes, there arechallenges instaying open tothe“work” of
adolescence. Important opportunities for expansion and
development during thistime canbeassociated with stress for
teens andfortheparents who love them. Forexample, the
pushing away from family thatadolescents tend todocanbe
seen asanecessary process enabling them toleave home.
This courage tomove outandaway iscreated bythebrain’s
reward circuits becoming increasingly active and inspiring
teens toseek novelty even intheface oftheunfamiliar asthey
move outinto theworld. After all,thefamiliar canbesafe
and predictable, while the unfamiliar can be unpredictable and
filled with potential danger. One historical view forusas
social mammals isthat ifolder adolescents didnotleave
home andmove away from local family members, ourspecies
90

would have toomuch chance ofinbreeding andourgenetics
would suffer. And forourbroader human story, adolescents’
moving outandexploring thelarger world allows ourhuman
family tobefarmore adaptive intheworld asthegenerations
unfold. Ourindividual andourcollective lives depend onthis
adolescent push away.
Hard asitisforparents toworry about their teen’s potentially
risky behavior, thepositive bias ofhyperrational thinking
helps adolescents take onrisks thatthey’ll need toembrace if
they aretoleave thenest andexplore theworld. Aswe’ve
seen, thedrive tohave increased social connections cankeep
ussafeasweassociate with ouradolescent peers who arealso
making the journey out into the unfamiliar world. Our
increased sensitivity toourown heightened emotional states
andtoourpeers’ influence—our emotional spark andsocial
engagement—are fundamental tothis journey aswell.
Seeking outnovelty andcreating new ways ofdoing things
also helps ourspecies adapt totheever-changing world. Ifthe
brain throughout thelifespan isindeed a“work inprogress,”
asrecent studies suggest, then thework that occurs during
adolescence issomuch more than simply aprocess ofmoving
from immaturity tomaturity. The essence ofadolescence
enriches our lifelong journey to embrace life fully.
What wearecoming toseeisthat there isacrucial setof
brain changes during ouradolescence creating new powers,
new possibilities, and new purposes fueling theadolescent
mind andrelationships that simply didnotexist like thisin
childhood. These positive potentials areoften hidden from
view andyetthey canbeuncovered andused more effectively
andmore wisely when weknow how tofind them andhow to
cultivate them. Wecanlearn tousecutting-edge science to
91

make the most ofthe adolescent period oflife. It’s a
pay-it-forward investment for everyone involved.
Fortheteen, thegrowth ofthebody itself, with alterations in
physiology, hormones, sexual organs, and thearchitectural
changes inthebrain, also cancontribute toourunderstanding
ofadolescence asanimportant period oftransformation.
Changing emotions revolutionize how wefeelasteens inside,
making more complex theways ofprocessing information
and ourideas about theself and others, and even creating
huge developmental shifts andtransitions intheinner sense of
who weareandwho wecanbecome. This ishow asense of
identity shifts and evolves throughout adolescence.
From theinside, these changes canbecome overwhelming,
andwemay even lose ourway, andfeelthatlifeisjust“too
much” tonavigate attimes. From theoutside, such changes
may attimes seem likewearelostand“out ofcontrol.” Our
adolescent years, atime oflifefilled with challenges thatcan
strengthen who weare,canbechallenging forsure. Butthe
great news isthat with increased self-awareness ofour
emotional and social lives, and with an increased
understanding ofthe brain’s structure and function, the
powerful positive effects ofthecomplex changes that occur
during adolescence can beharnessed with the proper
approach and understanding.
Making Decisions
Throughout adolescence, different areas ofthebrain link
together, aprocess we’ve discussed called “integration.” One
outcome ofintegration isthegrowth offibers ofcognitive
control that ultimately decrease impulsivity. Asaresult,
adolescents areafforded more andmore space inthemind to
92

pause andconsider other options ofresponse than aninitial
impulse. Another outcome ofthis integrative growth is
sharpened gistthinking, whereby theadolescent isable torely
more and more onintuition toseethelarger picture ofa
situation and therefore make wiser decisions.
Let’s seehow abetter focus ondeveloping gistthinking in
ourearlier example ofthecaraccident might have helped a
teen make better decisions, decisions thatcould have saved a
life. Iftheteen orhisparents were able toacknowledge his
longing forspeed asanatural dopamine reward drive, then
theurge could have been channeled inaconstructive way.
There aremany options, including taking partinathletics
where competition and speed and power areparts ofthe
sport—racecar driving, running, bicycling, skiing—risky and
adventurous activities that don’t putinnocent bystanders in
harm’s way. For example, when myson was inhisearly
teens, we’d spend hours onthe weekends racing long
skateboards down closed multilevel parking garages atthe
university where Iwork. When we’d gettothebottom, we’d
take theelevator back upand race down again. Having
helmets onandwearing hard gloves tokeep ourskin from
scraping ontheconcrete aswemade those sharp turns helped
minimize thedamage toourbodies, most ofwhich Iseemed
toget, nothim. There’s nothing wrong with thedrive for
thrills—the issue ishow toharness those drives soasto
minimize harm tooneself orothers. The idea here isto
respect thedopamine-driven need forspeed orother risky
activities, butthen channel thisdrive inhelpful ways. Ifwe
caninstill awareness ofthepositive sides ofthese drives, and
then find constructive approaches toaddressing them, tragic
outcomes likemyteacher’s death might beavoided. Notonly
might Billstillbealive, buttheyoung man would nothave
93

theburden ofliving with thefeeling ofresponsibility forthat
accident.
Sadly, instead ofaddressing apotentially dangerous problem
with their son, hisparents may have unintentionally rewarded
hisearlier risky behavior with abrand-new car. Sowhy
wouldn’t hetrysomething dangerous again? That’s how risky
behavior without anegative consequence canreinforce itself
tohappen again and again. Many ofusknow ofother
examples ofreckless teen behavior that went unaddressed:
driving acarwithout alicense andlosing theability todrive
later on,taking thechance ofhaving unprotected sexand
risking getting adisease orgetting pregnant, trying
combinations ofstreet drugs without knowing their
potentially lethal effects, orgetting atattoo from a
disreputable source andriskgetting hepatitis. There areeven
more minor risks, likenottaking thetime tosleep before an
exam because youaretalking with friends onthephone late
into thenight, orgetting lostinsocial media andposting an
insulting comment about someone’s looks oradrunk party
photo ofyourself thatacollege admissions officer later sees.
Inallthese situations theteen isseeing thePROS and
de-emphasizing therisks. That’s thepositive bias ofthe
adolescent mind.
Honoring the important and necessary changes inthe
adolescent mind andbrain rather than disrespecting them is
crucial forboth teens and their parents. When weembrace
these needed changes, when weoffer teens thesupport and
guidance they need instead ofjustthrowing upourhands and
thinking we’re dealing with an“immature brain that simply
needs togrow up,” or“raging hormones inneed oftaming,”
94

weenable adolescents todevelop vital new capacities that
they can use to lead happier and healthier lives.
Gist thinking emerges with both experience andprogrammed
brain development. Inother words, the timing ofthe
development ofthe brain is shaped by both
experience-induced neural activation and by genetic
information. Experience shapes theconnections inthebrain
itself even ifitcannot affect thegeneral timing ofsuch
maturation. And studies suggest that gist thinking emerges
from thegrowth ofintegration inourbrains asteens. The
timing may beinpart genetically determined, butwecan
shape thedegree ofdevelopment ofintegration inourbrains.
Experience shapes ourdevelopment during ouradolescence

“Don’t DoIt”Doesn’t DoIt:The Power ofPromoting the
Positive
Gist thinking draws onthegutfeeling andheartfelt sense ofa
positive value, ofaiming forsomething rather than inhibiting
something. Soinstead oftrying toshut down animpulse by
inhibiting it,adults with adolescents intheir lives and
adolescents themselves should focus onapositive factor to
promote. Choosing nottogetatattoo atanunknown place
95

because youvalue your health isvery different from saying,
“Iwon’t doitbecause mymother toldmenotto.”Incontrast,
hyperrational thinking considers theimpulse andsenses the
reward drive to realize the positive thrill, the
sensation-seeking speed-driven adrenaline rush ofgetting a
tattoo with some friends. And itdoesn’t hurt thatyouarealso
breaking your parents’ rules.
Public health advocates’ efforts toreduce teen smoking are
powerful examples ofhow appealing totheadolescent’s
emerging strength interms ofgistthinking canhelp promote
healthy behaviors. The adolescent period is,aswe’ve seen, a
time ofgreat vulnerability tobecoming addicted tovarious
substances, including cigarettes. It’snotjustthatteens smoke
more, butalso that thechanging teen brain itself isopen to
becoming addicted inpart because ofitsenhanced dopamine
response. Ifpeople aregoing tosmoke cigarettes, they most
likely start during their teenage years. The same istrue with
drug addiction. Themost effective strategy togetadolescents
toavoid smoking wasnotoffering teens medical information
ortrying tofrighten them with images ofgraveyards, two
strategies thatdidnothing toreduce teens’ taking upsmoking
orcontinuing tosmoke. The strategy that worked was to
inform them about how theadults who owned thecigarette
companies were brainwashing them tosmoke sothat they
could gettheir money. Rather than getting teens tosaynoto
smoking because some adult wasfrightening them intoit,this
strategy focused onthepositive value ofbeing strong inthe
face ofmanipulative adults out toget rich. When this
embracing ofhow theadolescent mind worked was taken up
bypublic health advocates, therateofteen smoking dropped.
Simply saying “Don’t doit”wasn’t enough. Aiming fora
96

positive value, like not letting someone—especially an
adult—brainwash you, worked.
Knowing about these understandable and genetically based
changes intheteenage brain can help adults support the
adolescent’s need forpushing back ontheadult status quo
and theexploration ofnew possibilities. Encouraging the
reflection onvalues and ongut instinct, not simply the
inhibition ofimpulses, isthedifference between turning down
acompelling impulse andembracing athoughtful belief and
value.
Integrating Your Brain
Inmany ways, how wedecide todothings inlifereveals who
weareatthat moment. When weunderstand how thebrain
changes during ouradolescence, wecanunderstand how the
decision-making process changes, too. The brain changes
during thisperiod intwodimensions. One ishow itreduces
thenumber ofthebrain’s basic cells, theneurons, andtheir
connections, thesynapses. This decreasing ofneurons and
synapses iscalled “pruning” and appears tobegenetically
controlled, shaped byexperience andintensified with stress.
How canwetolerate losing some neurons? During childhood
there isanoverproduction ofneurons and their synaptic
connections. The blossoming ofour neuronal populations
begins inutero andextends toourprepubertal period, toabout
eleven years ofageingirls andtwelve andahalf inboys.
Some pruning begins early aswelearn anddevelop skills, but
theremoval ofour overall number ofneurons and their
connections reaches itspeak during therobust remodeling
period ofadolescence. Inadolescence weprune those excess
connections away, leaving theones we’ve been using and
discarding the ones we don’t seem to need anymore.
97

Experience shapes which neural circuits—the neurons and
their synaptic connections—will bepruned away. Soifyou
want tohave amusical skill, best tostart itearly, before the
end ofadolescence. And ifyou want tobeagold-medal
Olympic athlete, best tostart inyour field before adolescence
begins. Even ifyou’re notaiming forathletic prowess, it’s
simply important toremember thatyour brain willrespond to
how you focus your attention inyour activities. Attention
streams energy andinformation through specific circuits and
activates them. The more you useacircuit, thestronger it
gets. The less you useacircuit, themore likely itmay get
pruned away during adolescence.
How youfocus your attention throughout life, andespecially
during theadolescent period, plays animportant role in
shaping thegrowth ofyour brain. Attention maintains and
strengthens existing connections, and aswe’ll see, ithelps
grow new connections and make those connections more
effective. Our mindsight tools sections areallabout learning
tofocus your mind’s attention tointegrate your brain’s
connections.
Asecond way thebrain transforms during thisperiod isthatit
lays down “myelin,” asheath covering themembranes among
interlinked neurons. This myelin sheath enables thepassage
oftheelectrical flow, the“neuronal activations” among the
remaining linked neurons, toallow faster and more
synchronized information toflow. When thatflow isfastand
coordinated, itmakes foramore effective and efficient
process. Aswelearn specific skills andacquire knowledge,
wegrow new connections andeven new neurons. Once we’ve
established these new synaptic linkages, wecanlaydown
98

myelin tomake that circuit quicker, more coordinated, and
more effective.
These two fundamental changes—pruning and
myelination—help the adolescent brain become more
integrated. Integration, thelinking ofdifferent parts, creates
more coordination in the brain itself.
We develop gist thinking asthis pruning and myelination
creates integration in the brain.
These more precise and efficient connections inthebrain
make forwiser judgment anddiscernments based notonthe
small details that arewithout alarger context butonthe
overall gistthatsees thebigpicture. Weuseourintuition to
guide ourdecisions asweaim forpositive values, honoring
what matters tous.That isgist thinking, one ofthemany
things that thegrowth ofintegration inthebrain during our
adolescent years creates.
Aswe’ll see, thevery specific forms ofchange inthe
architecture ofthebrain enable usasadolescents tostart to
usejudgment based ongistthinking, which isinformed by
experience and intuition rather than reliant onthereward
drive and the literal calculations of our earlier years.
Think ofitthis way: With those neural connections from
childhood that were sonumerous, lots ofdetails filled our
minds. That’s what weneeded aschildren soaking upfacts
and figures from school. With adolescence, wehave an
increased reward drive andincreased emotional reactions and
increased sensitivity tosocial engagements. This combination
means that we’ll have lots ofdetails still filling ourminds
before pruning, andintense emotions andheightened concern
about ouracceptance bypeers will drive either impulsive
99

behavior orreward-driven hyperrational decision-making that
isbased mainly onliteral calculations. The upside ofthis
period offunctioning isthepositive bias weneed totake the
necessary risks toget ready toexplore the world as
adolescents. From adecision-making perspective, theprocess
looks like this: Details without perspective from experience
win theday asprobabilities areassessed and theRussian
roulette gunisfired. Chances aremost likely thatallwill be
fine. Butsometimes itisnot.Justthink ofsome ofthethings
you may have tried inyour younger years, orwhat you are
trying outnow. When youthink about those risks youtook,
youmay even shake your head indisbelief thatyouactually
didthose things. Ifyour gistthinking andintuitive wisdom
areatwork, youmay reflect onthose times andwonder what
in the world you were thinking. Now you know.
Wecanseewhy parents canbevery concerned about the
adolescent tendency toseek thrills. The tripling inaccidental
injuries and mortality during this otherwise very healthy
period isnotjustinaparent’s imagination; itisastatistical
fact. Itmay behard foryouasanadolescent tohave empathy
forwhat your parents arefacing, butinthebigpicture this
understanding may behelpful notjustforthem butforyou,
too. When you communicate with your parents about these
statistical matters, andthen deal with your individual needs
andplans, everyone canfeelheard andmore effective ways of
coming to a decision can be created.
Weneed toincrease ourcommunication about these issues,
honoring thehealthy andnecessary essential aspects ofour
adolescent years andlearning tochannel thispower inmore
helpful ways. Knowing about thespecific circuits inthebrain
thatcreate thismore integrated way offunctioning canhelp
100

usenvision amore constructive approach tohow weliveand
make our decisions as adolescents and as adults.
A Handy Model of the Brain
The reason toknow some basic details about thebrain is
simple. When weknow something about theparts ofour
brains, wecanlearn todirect ourattention innew ways that
help those parts work inamore coordinated and balanced
way. What weknow about thebrain canhelp usgrow our
brains in integrative ways. That’s it. And that’s pretty useful.
Handy Model of the Brain
The brain inthepalm ofthehand. This “handy model”
depicts themajor regions ofthebrain: cerebral cortex inthe
101

fingers, limbic area inthethumb, andbrainstem inthepalm.

Wewill look into thebrain notonly because itiswhat is
changing inusasadolescents, butalso because knowing
about itcanhelp usoptimize theopportunities ofadolescence.
This understanding canhelp you think, feel, andbehave in
ways that help you getalong better inyour life, feel better,
andbemore theperson you want tobe.Wewon’t need a
plastic model orbigposter ofthebrain forthisexploration.
We’re about togettoknow avery handy model ofthebrain,
one you can take with you wherever you go.
Ifyou fold your thumb into your palm, and then fold the
fingers over your thumb, you’ll have facing youauseful hand
model ofthebrain. Give itatryright now andlet’s seehow
these parts fittogether. Inthis model thearea ofyour
fingernails facing youisjustbehind theface—and theback of
your hand iswhere theback ofthebrain attheback ofyour
head would be.
The highest part ofthebrain, represented byyour fingers, is
justunder your scalp within your skull. This isthecortex or
outer bark ofthebrain. Wethink andreflect, perceive and
remember, plan and make decisions with our cortex.
Awareness comes, inpart, from what happens inthecortex,
andsoself-awareness comes from thiscortical region. Ifyou
liftyour fingers, you’ll seebelow them thethumb, which
represents theemotion-generating limbic area ofthebrain.
Thelimbic area isincharge ofalotofthings, including what
motivates us,how wefocus our attention, and how we
102

remember things. Liftthethumb, andyou’ll findinyour palm
thelowest andoldest area ofthebrain, thebrainstem .This
ancient region isinvolved inkeeping usawake orletting us
sleep. And it’sthepart ofthebrain thatcaninteract with the
thumb region above it,thelimbic area, tocreate reactive
states ofbeing angry orscared. Since thebrainstem and
limbic areas are below the cortex, we call these the
“subcortical regions.” Lift your fingers and putthem back
over thethumb and palm and you’ll seehow thecortex
literally sits on top of these two subcortical regions.
The brain itself sitsatop thespinal cord, represented byyour
wrist. Input from thisneural tube within thebackbone, along
with other neural inputs from thebody andfrom thebody’s
organs such astheheart andintestines, enables theprocesses
ofourorgans, muscles, andbones todirectly influence the
neural firings intheskull itself, neural activity within the
subcortical and cortical parts ofthebrain. Not represented
here directly isthecerebellum ,which would bejustbehind
thelimbic area andplays animportant role inbalancing the
body’s motions and also balancing theinteraction ofour
thoughts andfeelings. Aband ofneurons, called thecorpus
callosum ,links theleftandright sides ofthebrain toeach
other and coordinates and balances their activities.
103

This isaleftward-facing model oftheright side ofthebrain.
Thebrainstem andthecerebellum arepartofthe“hindbrain”
and regulate basic processes like heart rate and states of
alertness. Connecting thetwosides ofthebrain isaband of
tissue called the corpus callosum. The amygdala and
hippocampus, which arepart oftheoldmammalian region
called thelimbic area, form the“midbrain” and help with
functions such asemotional balance andmemory processes.
The cortex, also known asthe “forebrain,” makes
representations orimages ofthings. Thefront-most partofthe
cortex isthe prefrontal cortex, which coordinates and
balances thefunctions ofmany areas bylinking input from
the cortex, limbic area, brainstem, body, and social
interactions. The insula isacircuit that connects bodily
processes totheprefrontal area forself-awareness. From
Daniel J.Siegel, M.D., The Developing Mind, 2ndedition,
copyright © 2012 by Mind Your Brain Inc.
Thecortex helps usbeconscious inourlives, tothink clearly
about things, toassess asituation andreason through it,to
104

remember other events, andtopause andreflect onwhat is
going on.Those arealotofimportant functions, andit’swhy
thecortex, especially thefront part, iscalled theexecutive
region. Itisthemaster control center that coordinates and
balances the whole brain and the body itself.
Theforward partofthecortex, thefrontal lobe, develops alot
during infancy and toddlerhood, and itcontinues togrow
during theremainder ofchildhood. When ouradolescence
begins, even more dramatic changes inthis frontal region
occur. The reason this area issoimportant isthat it
participates inthelinkage ofdifferent neural regions toone
another. Inthisway, thecortex hasanintegrative role asit
coordinates andbalances much ofwhat happens throughout
thebrain, andeven inthenervous system throughout thebody
as a whole.
Aswe’ll see,thefrontal areas ofthecortex also linkourown
neural firing totheactivity ofother nervous systems, toother
brains within other people. Inthis way, thefrontal area is
involved inboth theshaping ofour own internal mental
processes such asthinking anddecision making aswell asthe
social processes such asempathy and moral behavior. So
when wespeak about changes intheadolescent brain, we’ll
seethatmany ofthese important changes involve increasing
levels ofintegration, especially carried outinthecortex. This
increased cortical integration enables such diverse abilities as
cognitive control, emotional regulation, gist thinking,
self-understanding andsocial functions tochange andemerge
throughout adolescence.
One ofthecentral hubs that link thenodes ofourlarger
cognitive, emotional, and social networks ofcircuits into a
functional whole isinthefrontal region ofthecortex. A
105

network contains many different parts, ornodes, andahubis
theaspect ofthenetwork that links those different nodes to
one another. Anode inthenervous system, forexample,
might becollections ofneurons inthelimbic area orinthe
cortex. One important nervous system hub that links the
nodes together isjustbehind theforehead. Because itisatthe
front ofthefrontal areas, itiscalled theprefrontal cortex .
Notice how inyour hand model this integrative prefrontal
region, located atthe ends ofyour fingers, your
prefrontal-fingernail region, connects the cortex tothe
subcortical limbic-thumb and brainstem-palm regions. In
addition, thisprefrontal region links input from thebody itself
and from other people. Energy and information from the
cortex, limbic area, brainstem, body, and social world are
coordinated andbalanced bytheprefrontal region. Itisthis
integrative role, connecting and coordinating many
differentiated inputs, thatmakes thegrowth oftheprefrontal
cortex socentral toourunderstanding ofhow wechange and
become more integrated as adolescents.
Adolescence as the Gateway to Creative Exploration
Inanutshell: The overall movement ofthe brain’s
development istobecome more integrated .What thatmeans
isthat areas will become more specialized and then
interconnected tooneanother inmore effective ways. That’s
what thepruning down ofconnections andthemyelination of
remaining connections create—the differentiation of
specialized regions and then their coordinated linkage. The
result ofsuch aprocess istohave more efficient and
specialized processing ofinformation. This isconsistent with
ourdiscussions ofthegist-based thinking thatsees through all
thedetails tofind thewisest judgment about asituation. What
106

arethebasic ways such atransformation ofthinking can
occur? What arethebasic units ofthebrain’s structure that
support such reconstructive and integrative changes in
adolescence?
Aswe’ve seen, both ourgenes andourexperiences contribute
tohow synaptic connections will form andinterconnect the
various parts ofthenetwork intocircuits. What thismeans is
that thechanges inthebrain will bedueinpart togenetic
information we’ve inherited and inpart toexperiences we
engage in.Experience streams energy flow through particular
neurons andstrengthens their connections with oneanother. It
isimportant toknow about ourneuronal connections because
they shape how we feel, think, reason, and make decisions.
Because thispruning andmyelination restructures thebrain’s
networks ofconnections, itisoften called “remodeling.” The
remodeling changes intheintegrative frontal areas ofthe
cortex areresponsible forthefinding thatasteens webegin to
become aware ofourselves and tothink about life in
conceptual andabstract ways. Ouremerging adolescent minds
begin toconsciously and creatively explore the deeper
meanings oflife, offriendships, ofparents, ofschool, of
everything. Even the ability toreflect on our own
personalities emerges during theyears ofadolescence. While
genes determine some ofthe timing ofthese changes,
experience—what wethink about, what wediscuss with
friends, how wespend ourtime—will help expand onthis
new way ofthinking about theworld. Forexample, some
teens may not engage insuch reflective thoughts or
conversations with their friends orwith their family. Inthis
situation, their interpersonal experience ofcultivating
self-awareness may not be so well developed.
107

What wefocus ourattention onand what wespend time
doing directly stimulate thegrowth ofthose parts ofthebrain
that carry out those functions.
108

109

Rather than theconcrete way ofthinking andthefact-based
learning that dominates inchildren during theelementary
school years, thelearning curve forusasteens involves a
focus onmore complex concepts. Our literal experience of
being aware oflifeexplodes with new visions ofwhat isreal,
visions that inchildhood may nothave even crossed our
minds. This iswhy adolescence issuch anamazing time. The
growth ofthefrontal lobes permits ustoexperience our
human ability ofknowing about knowing—of reflecting on
how wethink, how wefeel, why wedowhat wedo,andhow
wemight dothings differently. AsDorothy said inThe
Wizard of Oz , “We’re not in Kansas anymore.”
Iremember thatwhen Iwas ateen, thisnew awareness was
overwhelming. Iwent from smiling alotduring mychildhood
tobeing more grumpy, more inward, more confused and
pensive. When Ifirst hitmyteens, myfather would askme
why Ididn’t smile anymore, andIjustdidn’t know what to
saytohim. When Igotolder, Isaw thefilm Harold and
Maude with some friends andcouldn’t stop thinking ofCat
Stevens’s lyrics intheclassic song “IfYou Want toSing Out,
Sing Out”: “Well, ifyou want tosing out, sing out. And if
youwant tobefree, befree.” There were amillion things I
could be,thesong said, andIcould dowhatever Iwanted, I
could make things come true. Iused tosing itinmyhead,
over andover; itplayed likeanendless tape. When Ilisten to
thesong now asanadult, Icanseethatthose lyrics capture
theessence ofour journey into those teen years. It’s a
coming-of-age song, ofletting adults gointo thebackground
as we create a new world as adolescents.
This emergence oftheadolescent mind isourbirthright as
human beings.
110

Our species name isHomo sapiens sapiens. Sapiens means
“knowing.” Sowith thedouble knowing wearetheones who
notonly know, butknow weknow. And this knowing we
know emerges firstinadolescence. Creative and conscious
explorations ofconceptual thinking and abstract reasoning
enable thebrain toapproach oldproblems innew ways. A
fifteen-year-old isn’t simply aten-year-old with five
additional years ofexperience. Brain development means that
asadolescents wecanthink inconceptual andabstract ways a
ten-year-old cannot even imagine. One aspect ofthis
exploration canbedivergent thinking, away ofapproaching
problems creatively to“think outside thebox.” We can
approach problems innew ways, andwecanapproach our
self-understanding innew ways never before possible. This
creative exploration encompasses ways ofperceiving and
reasoning and problem solving with abstract capacities and
thinking strategies andreflective capabilities thatpermit usto
tackle life’s challenges in more innovative ways.
111

The changes inhow we think and expansions inour
awareness arebecause ofthebrain’s remodeling and area
healthy part ofouradolescence. The reconstruction ofthe
cortex enables conceptual thinking andcreative explorations
to emerge and blossom.
With this expanded capacity ofconsciousness, we are
entering apotentially new way ofapproaching theworld and
how wefitinto it.Instead oftheoldpattern ofjust going
along with earlier knowledge sponged upfrom adults when
wewere elementary school–aged children, asadolescents our
brains now permit this new form ofthinking that can
challenge oldways ofdoing things. This new conceptual
thinking even enables ustoseethat theoldway ofdoing
112

things embedded inourbrains isjustoneapproach—and we
cannow come upwith another approach thatmay bejustas
good or perhaps even better.
The power oftheadolescent mind emerges from these brain
changes, which permit ustosolve problems innew and
innovative ways. We might even saythat this isalso the
primary work and purpose oftheadolescent period—the
essence of adolescence.
Aswe’ve seen, many revolutionary ways ofinterpreting and
shaping our world—in music and artand intherecent
creation ofourdigital age—emerge during theemotionally
vibrant, socially connected, novelty-seeking adolescent
period. Adolescence isagolden ageforinnovation because it
isduring this time ofgrowth and change that thebrain’s
developmental shifts inthereward centers andinthecortex
encourage creative thought anddrive adolescents toexplore
the world in new ways.
Soabstract andconceptual thinking, increased reward drive,
and enhanced novelty seeking are three sources ofthe
potential and passion forcreative thought. These capacities
need tobeblended with disciplined study, naturally, toallow
knowledge to inform innovation.
Yes, these years canbechallenging tonavigate because in
addition toinnovation, they also involve riskandrebellion, as
we’ve seen. Impulsivity andhyperrational thinking enable us
todrive toofast, take onunnecessary risks, and endanger
ourselves andothers. Wejump offcliffs into theseaandget
hurt. Butthere isamiddle ground, aplace tohonor thedrive
fornovelty and thecreation ofnew explorations. Ifweas
adults push back severely against these natural changes,
113

rejecting adolescents asthey reject us,theresult canbea
shutting down of all communication between the generations.
The call istoincrease empathetic understanding and
respectful communicating, creating integration across the
generations.
Just aswhen adolescent elephants aredeprived oftheir male
elders inaherd and then runwild and become destructive
without theadults’ presence, total isolation ofadolescent
humans from theadult community can beanunhelpful
standoff. Technology’s products—cars, synthesized drugs,
weapons, theworldwide web—make thestakes higher. Soan
important lesson for adults and adolescents isthis:
Adolescents’ pushing away isnot thesame asshutting
completely out. Ifboth sides ofthegenerational divide
understood each other more fully, perhaps these important
years ofinnovation andtransition could benavigated better,
helping adolescents grow intothepeople they have thepower
and potential to become.
Ourchallenge, simply put,istoseethepower andpotential of
theteenage brain andtheemerging adolescent mind asassets
rather than liabilities.
Creating Collaboration Across the Generations
Inmiddle school, myson and hisfourteen-year-old band
mates once stacked upalltheamplifiers intheir music
practice room toseehow huge a“wall ofsound” they could
make with alltheinstruments being played atthesame time
through thesame system. Onthefloor above thepractice
room were theschool’s administrative offices. Needless to
say, thenearly shattered windows inthebuilding were an
incentive forthehead oftheschool tocome down onmyson
114

and hisfriends with severe consequences. One ofthose
consequences was tobarthem from using thepractice room
forthree months. The result was that those adolescents, not
being able tohave their creative outlet ofmusic atschool,
started doing even more egregious things. The cycle of
pushing back bytheteens andthen pushing back bytheadults
began. Atameeting, Isuggested that theadministrators, as
theadults inthecycle, trytoseethrough thevicious feedback
loop andconsider thedrive fornovelty andexploration that
the amplifier-stacking experiment was really meant to be.
Fortunately, oneoftheadministrators remembered herown
brother’s experience ofasimilar cascade ofevents. She
suggested they try adifferent approach. The school
administrators brought theband mates in,told them the
negative effects oftheir actions, gave them back their
privilege ofusing thepractice room, andsaid they could keep
that privilege ifthey didn’t violate thebasic rules ofthe
school. Alloftheir “conduct problem” behavior disappeared
for the next five years.
The key tothis creative solution was honoring thenatural
adolescent drive forinnovation andthecreation ofnew ways
ofdoing things. Honoring does notmean setting nolimits. It
means acknowledging the intention behind the actions.
Adolescence isallabout experimentation. Ifadults shut that
down, thepassion fornovelty willbethwarted, theteens will
become disillusioned and disconnected, and noone will
benefit. Ifeltgrateful thatthose administrators could think in
creative andcollaborative ways, asthey drew ontheessence
oftheir “inner teenager,” tocome upwith adevelopmentally
appropriate, behaviorally andpsychologically effective plan.
They understood thatthewaterfall wasgoing toflow, sothey
115

used their adult skills tochannel itspath. Itwas awin-win
situation foreveryone. And theband went ontocreate and
perform some really fine music.
Sometimes asadults weseetheadolescent drive toward
experimentation tocreate novelty asonly anegative change,
asonly aproblem, asasign ofteens being “crazy.” Asan
adult and asaparent, Iunderstand theidea behind this
sentiment. Butperpetuating thenotion thatthese natural and
healthy pushes toward novelty mean teens areonly “out of
their minds” isnotahelpful message foranyone. Weare
moving out ofour old minds and into new ones as
adolescents, andouradolescent mind isfullofpositive power
andthepotential forcreativity. And thispower issomething
weallneed tohonor. Thekeyasanadolescent orasanadult
is to tap into that potential and help cultivate that power.
Vulnerability and Opportunity
Adolescence canbeseen asatransformative period inwhich
individuals gofrom being open toeverything (inchildhood)
tobecoming expert atafew things (inadulthood). We’ve
seen thatoneaspect ofthisremodeling ispruning, orletting
gooftheconnections inthebrain thatarenotneeded. Pruning
ingeneral canlead toimportant changes inhow wefunction
asteens—and sometimes itcanunmask potential problems.
This iswhy anumber ofmental health challenges, likemood
difficulties such asdepression and bipolar disorder, or
thinking difficulties such asschizophrenia, may emerge more
inadolescence than inchildhood. Pruning, along with
hormonal changes andalterations inhow genes areexpressed,
shapes ourneural activity andsynaptic growth andmakes the
brain’s functioning change dramatically during theteenage
years.
116

Ifthere isany vulnerability inthebrain’s makeup during
childhood, adolescence can reveal those brain differences
because oftheparing down oftheexisting butinsufficient
number ofneurons andtheir connections. Such vulnerability
may have awide array ofcauses, from genetics totoxic
exposures toadverse childhood experiences such asabuse or
neglect. This developmental view proposes that the
vulnerability oftheadolescent period happens because the
pruning ofchildhood circuits that may have been “atrisk”
leads tothe unmasking ofthose deficiencies. The new
activation ofgenes during adolescence, which shape how
neurons grow andhow they interact with other neurons, may
also influence thevulnerability ofateenager’s brain. Even if
average pruning occurs, what remains may beinsufficient to
enable mood tobekept inbalance orforthought tobe
coordinated with reality. Ifstress ishigh, thispruning process
may beeven more intense, andmore oftheat-risk circuits
may bediminished innumber andeffectiveness. Theresult is
theunmasking ofunderlying vulnerability during thepruning
ofadolescence. Thebrain’s integrative growth willnotoccur
optimally, and depending onwhich circuits areaffected,
impaired coordination and balance in the brain can happen.
During high school andthecollege years, major psychiatric
disorders, such as depression, bipolar disorder, or
schizophrenia, canexpress themselves forthefirst time, even
inotherwise well-functioning individuals. When mood or
thought becomes dysfunctional, filled with rigidity orchaos
thatdisrupts adaptive functioning forlong periods oftime, it
ispossible that ateen isexperiencing not simply the
unavoidable intense emotions ofadolescence butsomething
more. Perhaps there issimply aperiod ofimpaired integration
during remodeling inthebrain thattemporarily leads tosuch
117

chaos andrigidity andfurther development may correct that
impairment. But sometimes that onset ofsevere behavioral
issues isthesign ofadisorder thatmay beappearing andthat
needs evaluation andtreatment, aswith amood disorder, a
thought disorder, or an anxiety disorder with
obsessive-compulsive orpanic behavior. Since some ofthese
serious psychiatric conditions goalong with suicidal thoughts
andimpulses, seeking help tofigure outthesignificance of
such changes inyourself, inyour friend, orinyour teen, can
beextremely important. Imyself have afriend whose
daughter developed such amood condition incollege, andno
oneinthedorm helped herfind support. Shewas justcalled
“nuts” andbecame isolated, andnoonereached outtohelp
her until it was too late.
Naturally, with impaired integration inthebrain, themind
will notbeasflexible orasresilient. Sometimes thatlack of
integration can respond totherapy with apsychotherapist,
sometimes itmay also require amedication, butalways it
should begin with anopen mind andagood evaluation. When
your own mind stops working well, itcanbevery distressing
foryourself and forothers. And thestress ofhaving a
tumultuous mind can itself create more stress. Here,
remodeling hasuncovered anunderlying vulnerability, and
thedysfunction thatensues from theimpaired integration may
create itsown intensification ofthepruning process. This is
why getting help canbevery important toreduce stress and
reduce excessive pruning. Thekeythatisbeing explored now
inresearch ishow thispruning process, intensified bystress,
may create inadequate ways inwhich theconnections inthe
brain can function.
118

Clearly, early interventions tocreate astable lifeexperience
fortheindividual andreduce stress areessential tosupport the
healthy growth ofthebrain during thisperiod ofchange and
development. This isnot an“all-or-none” proposition in
which agenetic vulnerability always becomes apsychiatric
disorder. The reality isfarmore complex. Even identical
twins who share thesame genetic makeup donothave one
hundred percent probability thatboth ofthem will develop a
disorder. Experience plays abig role inhow thebrain
develops, even intheface ofgenetic orother riskfactors. We
canlook atgenes andother important variables assome ofthe
many factors that contribute toalarger picture ofbrain
growth. Genes may influence some aspects ofneural growth,
butthere isamuch fuller setoffactors thatcontribute toour
well-being than genetics alone. How themind unfolds, how
relationships aresupportive, how people feel asense of
belonging toalarger group allinfluence how thebrain
achieves andmaintains integrative development attheroot of
our pathway toward health.
During adolescence, thepruning and myelination and the
remodeling that they create happen primarily inthecortical
regions. While oneofthose areas istheprefrontal cortex, itis
important tokeep inmind thatthismost forward part ofthe
frontal cortex isnotsuper-special byitself; itismore accurate
tosay that the prefrontal region and related areas are
important because they coordinate andbalance other regions
ofthebrain. Inthisway, wecansaythattheprefrontal cortex
isintegrative asitlinks differentiated areas tooneanother.
This integration enables the“whole tobegreater than thesum
ofitsparts.” With thisintegration weachieve more complex
and useful functions. Aswe’ve seen, examples ofthese
119

include self-awareness, empathy, emotional balance, and
flexibility.
Astheprefrontal region serves asamaster integrative hub,
what some might callamaster control center oranexecutive
region, itsrewiring during theadolescent period permits a
more extensive form ofintegration tobeachieved inthe
transition from childhood toadulthood. Aswe’ve noted
earlier, thishubisboth forthenetworks within thebrain and
body asawhole, and forthenetworks ofinterconnecting
brains wecallrelationships. Here weseehow theintegration
ofourinner networks andourinterpersonal networks shapes
ourexperience ofmind. Themind isembodied within usand
itisembedded between us.Our mind iswithin usand
between us.
The Remodeling Brain and Flipping Our Lids
Under theactive influence ofvarious drugs including alcohol,
ourminds canstop functioning well because ourprefrontal
region isnolonger able tocarry outitscoordination and
balance ofthestreams ofinformation from within ourbodies
andfrom theoutside world. While various drugs canshut off
our brain’s integrative functioning intheshort run and
chronic drug usage candistort thatcoordination andbalance
inourlives inthelong run, wecanalso beprone tolosing
integration inother ways that don’t involve drug use.
Sometimes wecan simply “flip our lids” and have the
prefrontal integrative fibers ofourbrains stop coordinating
ourwhole system. Since theprefrontal area isinastate of
reconstruction during adolescence, itmay beespecially prone
atcertain times totemporarily lose itsintegrative functioning
in linking separate areas to one another.
120

Even when wearedeveloping well, sometimes during this
remodeling period theprefrontal region’s ability tocarry out
thecoordination andbalance ofitsintegrative role may not
function optimally. Remodeling inthebrain isanecessary
part ofitsdevelopment and builds integration through the
adolescent years. This remodeling involves different phases,
with females andmales undergoing pruning andmyelination
indifferent regions atdifferent times. And remodeling is
energy consuming. Butwhile trajectories dodiffer between
thegenders, where thisremodeling process ultimately ends up
is actually quite similar across the genders.
The brain functions inastate-dependent way, meaning that
while itisinacalm state, certain integrative functions may
work well andefficiently. Butinother situations, those same
functions may notwork sowell. For many ofus,bythe
middle ofadolescence, when weareaway from ourpeers and
ouremotions areinbalance wecanbeasefficient asadults.
Butunder settings with increased emotion orinthepresence
ofpeers, reasoning canbecome skewed. The context weare
inandtheinternal emotional state ofourminds directly shape
how sensitive wearetolosing certain functions. This canbe
interpreted asbeing “too emotional” or“too swayed by
peers,” butanother view isthatouremotional sensitivity and
interest inpeers isadaptive. This isnotimmaturity buta
necessary step inhuman development. Weneed tolisten to
ourpeers inorder tobecome apartofthatvital survival group
as we leave our family home.
From afamily point ofview, thisincreased emotionality and
social influence canbecome disruptive tolifeathome. An
extreme form ofthisiswhen wegetreally agitated and“flip
our lids” or“fly off the handle.” Such astate of
121

non-integration canhappen abruptly inanyone, butinour
early adolescence wemay beespecially prone tobeing this
way under certain conditions, aswhen ourparents interrupt us
when they know wearebusy, orwhen afriend does notcall
even though she said she would.
Ifyouputyour hand model together andthen suddenly liftup
your fingers, you’ll seetheanatomic way wecansymbolize
how welose theintegrative role oftheprefrontal cortex.
Without thecalming influence ofthatcortical region, sudden
outbursts oflimbic lava andbursts ofreactivity—the ancient
reactions offight, flight, freeze, orfaint—can emerge
suddenly, sometimes without warning toanyone. These are
ourearly, primitive, subcortical reactions tothreat. Since the
cortex isacenter forawareness, these lower brain areas can
become active without ourconscious mind’s knowing what is
stirring deep inside thebrain. Then wham! Outcomes asetof
reactions wedidn’t even know were cooking inside us.Sound
familiar? Ithappened tomealotwhen Iwas ayoung teen.
And itcancertainly happen tousasadults, too.Itisatthese
moments when avulnerable prefrontal cortex isnotatthetop
ofitsgame monitoring andmanaging thesubcortical world
thatsuch “low road” reactions canerupt. Ifwehaven’t slept
well, haven’t eaten, are under pressure, orfeel some
underlying emotional agitation, the prefrontal cortex’s
calming influences may notwork sowell andwecanflipour
lids. Adolescent or adult, this is a part of being human.
122

The Low Road
Now, when itcomes toteenagers, thisflipping one’s lidis
often seen asbeing a“crazy teenager.” But let’s make an
agreement not tocall this crazy; let’s call itwhat it
is—remodeling and shifts inintegration. Inaconstruction
site, sometimes the previously working plumbing and
electricity aretemporarily disabled. Wedon’t have tocallthat
afaulty building—it’s just areconstruction project.
Remodeling hasitsinevitable downsides, forsure. Forashort
time, orforbursts oftime, those utilities ontheconstruction
site areoff-line. Noeffective electricity, noplumbing, no
workable staircase. These arealltemporary shifts inwhat
works well. The good news isthat remodeling isaprocess
that will create new and improved ways offunctioning.
Remodeling isnecessary toadapt thestructure ofourneural
foundation toadjust tonew needs, and remodeling in
adolescence isnecessary toadapt ourhuman family tothe
new needs ofachanging world. New levels ofintegration are
being created and new capacities arebeing established and
strengthened. Remodeling constructs new integration.
123

That said, sometimes theremodeling comes with challenging
ways ofthinking andfeeling andinteracting thatareparfor
the course in neural remodeling.
The reconstruction zone oftheprefrontal cortex inparticular
means thatmany ofthefunctions thatthisfrontal area ofthe
brain enables through its integrative role—balancing
emotions, planning for the future, having insight and
empathy—are more easily thrown off-line with intense
emotions andpeer influence. They may bemore fragile, more
easily disrupted, than they willbeintheyears ahead. Infact,
oneofmyfriends, whose sonisafewyears younger than my
son, once saidthatitfeltlikenight anddaywhen hissonwent
from nineteen totwenty years ofage. After hissoncompleted
hisfirst year ofcollege, myfriend toldmethathe“seemed to
have returned totheworld ofnormal human interactions.”
Now what didhemean bythat? His son’s balancing of
emotions hadbeen turned off,planning forthefuture wasnot
happening, insight into himself—or empathy for
others—seemed nottohave been displayed, atleast tothis
young man’s dad. How canwemake sense ofthiscommon
experience?
When youunderstand thattheprefrontal region isnecessary
foreach ofthese important functions tooccur, then youcan
understand why thechange toward asettling inafter some
intense periods ofremodeling feels sodifferent—likely
because theremodeling period isstabilizing andtheprefrontal
region can do its thing.
What isthat thing exactly? This region coordinates and
balances thewhole brain with thewhole body, andeven our
inner networks with thesocial world. Yes, thisregion behind
theforehead connects alltheparts ofthebrain intheskull to
124

oneanother, andlinks those functions towhat isgoing onin
thebody (signals from theheart, intestines, muscles). Then
those connected signals arewoven together with theinput
from other people. That’s alotofintegration, thelinkage of
different parts. Soasadolescents weneed tocutourselves
some slack, and asadults weneed togive respect tothe
remodeling adolescents aregoing through. That doesn’t mean
theshop isclosed, itmeans wemake adjustments forthefact
thattheadolescent mind isshaped, attimes, byaconstruction
zone.
Adolescence Builds Integration in the Brain
Take alook atyour hand model ofthebrain. Put your
limbic-thumb area over your brainstem-palm area. Those are
thelower parts ofthebrain, theones that generate emotion
andreactivity andreward drive, among other things. Now put
your fingers over your thumb, andtake alook atthemiddle
two fingernails. This istheprefrontal region. Notice how
when youliftupyour fingers-cortex andputthem back down,
youcanseehow thisprefrontal-fingernail area isconnected to
thecortex; itsits ontop ofthelimbic-thumb, and also
connects directly tothebrainstem-palm. Inaddition, signals
from thebody itself—from muscles and bones, from the
intestines and heart—all come uptothis prefrontal region,
too. And ifthat was notenough, thisprefrontal region also
makes maps ofwhat isgoing oninside other people’s nervous
systems. That’s right! The prefrontal region maps thesocial
world. Itisthis prefrontal area that creates ourmindsight
maps ofyouforempathy andofusformorality, aswell asa
mindsight map of me for insight.
Solet’s review thisnow with your hand model inmind. Five
separate areas ofinformation flow are coordinated and
125

balanced bytheprefrontal region. Here they are.The cortex.
The limbic area. The brainstem. The body proper. And the
social world. When these separate sources ofinformation
flow arelinked together, wecall that “integration.” And
integration iswhat creates the master functions of
self-awareness, reflection, planning, decision making,
empathy, andeven morality—thinking about thelarger social
good.
When theprefrontal region achieves anew state ofbeing
remodeled, those important functions become more
dependable andstronger. Integration cannow happen more
consistently andreliably. Brain, body, andsocial world are
woven together into one whole bytheprefrontal cortex.
Knowing about how thisprefrontal remodeling happens can
help usasadolescents andasadults notonly tounderstand
better what isgoing oninside thebrain buttodosomething
about itthat isconstructive, aswe’ll soon see. Infact, the
mindsight practices we’ll explore throughout thebook can
promote thegrowth ofthese integrative regions ofthebrain.
Yes, itturns outthat wecan cultivate thegrowth ofthe
integrative fibers oftheprefrontal cortex. Positive interactions
with others and self-reflection aretwo ways toincrease
prefrontal integration. That’s right: You cangrow those fibers
if you choose to learn how to do that!
The Emotional Lower Brain
Did you know that along with these prefrontal changes, the
lower brain areas below thecortex (your limbic-thumb and
brainstem-palm inthe hand model) are more active in
adolescents than they areinchildren orinadults? What this
means isthatemotions canarise rapidly andintensely without
thecalming influences oftheprefrontal cortex. Theprefrontal
126

region cansend soothing circuits, called “inhibitory fibers,”
down to these lower areas and keep their firing calmed.
Brain scans reveal thatwhen teens areshown aneutral face in
aphotograph, amajor area ofthe limbic region, the
amygdala, becomes activated, whereas inadults thesame
photograph merely activates thereasoning prefrontal cortex.
The result forteens canbeaninner sense ofconviction that
even another person’s neutral response isfilled with hostility
andhecannot betrusted. Ablank expression orabump inthe
hallway can beinterpreted asintentional, and ateen may
respond with anirritated remark even ifthelook orbump was
completely innocent. Knowing this scientific finding has
helped me asaparent tounderstand the often intense
reactions ofmyown adolescents tostatements Imade that, in
my view, were pretty neutral, but they experienced as
aggressive.
There aretworoutes thatsend information totheamygdala.
One isaslow route, inwhich thehigher cortex sifts through
information, reasons, reflects, andthen informs theamygdala
inacalm andrational way. There’s asecond route, onethat
bypasses thecortex and simply sends incoming streams of
perception directly totheamygdala. This isthefast route.
Studies ofadolescents reveal thateven under calm conditions,
thefast route toamygdala activation often occurs more
readily inteens than inadults; theslow route isused more in
adults. What thismeans isthattheintense emotions ofapure
amygdala response may riseupeven when nothing isshutting
offthecortex, aswhen we’ve flipped ourlidsinanagitated,
chaotic state orinashutdown, rigid state. Asteens wemay
simply have amore immediate emotional response thatisnot
filtered bycortical reasoning. That’s thefastroute inaction.
127

This iswhat wemean, inpart, when wesaythatadolescence
isaperiod ofmore emotional intensity, more emotional
spark. The fast route tothe amygdala ismore readily
activated during this period than it ever was, or ever will be.
Forallofus,asteenagers oradults, when intense emotions
erupt inourminds, weneed tolearn tofeel them anddeal
with them. AsFred Rogers used tosay ontelevision, if
feelings arementionable, they canbecome manageable. As
wehave seen intheMindsight Tools #1,wecan usethe
notion of“Name ittotame it.” Learning todeal with
emotions means being aware ofthem and modifying them
inside ussothat wecanthink clearly. Sometimes wecan
name ittotame itand help balance ourbrain’s emotional
intensity byputting words towhat wefeel. Ifwesaythename
ofanemotion inside ourown minds, itcanhelp. There are
even some brain studies thatshow how thisnaming process
can activate the prefrontal cortex and calm the limbic
amygdala! Learning tomanage ouremotions inadolescence
isanimportant part ofbecoming independent ofourparents
andbecoming strong inlife. Inthemindsight tools sections,
we’ll explore themany helpful emotion-balancing strategies
that cansupport ourgrowth inthisway during adolescence
and beyond.
Hardwired for Adventure and Connection
When wecompare ourown adolescent period with thesimilar
transition ofother animals, wefind some amazing parallels.
InZoobiquity ,abook onthesubject ofhow wehave alotin
common with our animal cousins, Barbara
Natterson-Horowitz andKathryn Bowers write: “Asimilarly
lowered risk threshold—indeed, anew pleasure inrisk
taking—likely propels nearly grown birds outofnests, hyenas
128

outofcommunal dens, dolphins, elephants, horses, andotters
into peer groups, and human teens into malls and college
dorms. Aswe’ve seen, having abrain thatmakes youfeelless
afraid enables, perhaps encourages, encounters with threats
andcompetitors that arecrucial toyour safety andsuccess.
Thebiology ofdecreased fear, greater interest innovelty, and
impulsivity serve apurpose across species. Infact, itcould be
that theonly thing more dangerous than taking risks in
adolescence is nottaking them.”
Indeed, thenatural process ofmoving away from thenest is
filled with risk. The risk ofnot taking risks that
Natterson-Horowitz and Bowers arereferring toisthat the
individual willnotbeable totake thechances needed toleave
thenest, and with such stagnation our species will not
survive. Risk breathes new life into rigid ways ofdoing
things. Wecanseethatdeep inourbrain’s structure, wemay
have theurge totake onrisky behaviors that canfeel asif
they arematters oflifeordeath. Forthehealth ofourfamily
across thegenerations, they areessential. And forourspecies
asawhole, they infact areamatter ofoursurvival. The
129

adolescent brain sets upapositive bias, emphasizing the
PROS and majorly de-emphasizing thecons inorder to
preserve our human family.
Wemight bedriven aswell toconnect with ourpeers, who
arealso moving outintotheworld, because ingroups wecan
find the safety ofbelonging. More eyes towatch for
predators, more compatriots tojoin inourshared journey
away from home, more companions toconnect toaswe
create anew world that isnecessary forthesurvival ofour
species.
Ionce had apatient come into myoffice with hispants’
waistline beneath hisrear end. Itwas quite thefashion afew
years back (itmay stillbe),anditpuzzled me.Icouldn’t stop
myself from asking about it.Sowith curiosity, butalso I
believe quite respectfully, Iasked, “Why doyou wear your
pants below your butt like that?” I’llnever forget hisfrank
response: “Ineed towear these pants likethissoIcanbelike
everyone else who istrying tobedifferent. Iamtrying tobe
like everybody else who istrying nottobelike everyone
else.” Exactly.
Sothathelps usunderstand thesituation. Teens often feelthat
they need one another much more than they need adults.
Adolescents areourfuture, anditisthrough their courage and
their sometimes outrageous butcreative efforts “not tobelike
everyone else” thatourspecies hasbeen adaptive. Ifweareto
survive onthisfragile andmagnificent planet, wearegoing to
need alltheingenuity oftherebellious adolescent mind to
find solutions tothegrave problems that ourand previous
adult generations have created in this world.
130

Asaparent, Ihave tried totake toheart these lessons from
science about adolescence. Itake adeep breath and tryto
remind myself thebest Icanthattheir push-back behavior is
embedded notjustintheir brains butinallourDNA. Their
push back now was our push back then, when wewere
adolescents. With thisuniversal human quality inmind, the
challenge ataminimum istofind away tohelp adolescents
navigate these years without seriously harming themselves or
others. That canbeafoundational goal: Atleast donoharm .
After that, everything isicing onthecake. Butnaturally we
canstart there andhave much greater expectations. Another
central goal istokeep thelines ofcommunication asopen as
they canbe.This view sets aframework that canhelp the
most challenging situations become abitmore manageable
andmake thisperiod atime ofcollaboration asbest wecan
across the generations.
131

MINDSIGHT TOOLS #2
Time-In
Want tocreate integration inyour brain? Taking time to
reflect inwardly isthescience-proven way todothat. Icall
this taking “time-in.”
We’ve been discussing how anintegrated brain gives you
astrong mind andenables you tohave healthy relationships
with others. Ifyouareinterested indeveloping integration in
your own brain, taking time-in tofocus your attention onyour
internal world hasbeen shown inresearch togrow those
important prefrontal fibers that integrate your life. This
mindsight tool will teach you how togrow theintegrative
fibers ofyour brain bylearning how tofocus your attention in
very practical ways.
Time-In, Mindsight, and Mindful Awareness
132

“Time-in” isaterm Iuse todescribe thetime wecan
take—be itaminute aday, tenminutes aday, orthroughout
theday—to intentionally focus ourattention ontheinner
world ofourmental, subjective experience. Much ofwhat
happens infamilies andinschools, andeven ontheInternet
with social media, pulls ourfocus ofattention totheouter
world. Think ofhow much time many ofusspend on
smartphones, iPads, andother devices absorbing anendless
stream ofinformation. Formany adolescents who’ve grown
upwith theInternet, e-mailing, chatting viatext, andsurfing
theNetarejustaregular partoflife.And while there arealot
133

ofgreat connections wecanmake through social media that
enhance friendships and social connections ingeneral, the
danger isthatwefailtopayattention toother aspects ofour
lives. Hours anddays cangobywithout ourtaking time-in to
just be with our inner life, the life of our own mind.
Why isthatanissue? youmay ask. Because without atleast
some time spent exercising ourmindsight circuits focusing on
theinner world—of ourselves orothers—those circuits won’t
remain healthy and strong. Tomove our lives toward
integration, wecan’t focus solely ontheoutside world of
physical objects. We need mindsight todevelop the
integration inourinner lives that cultivates ourinsight and
empathy.
Taking time-in onaregular basis ishelpful because it
exercises themindsight circuits thatcanintegrate ourbrains
and empower ourlives. One way oftaking time-in isto
develop mindful awareness, ways oftraining themind that
help usdevelop theability tobepresent with what is
happening inthemoment and toletgoofjudgments and
focus instead onaccepting lifeasitisrather than onhow we
expect ittobe.The way wefocus attention totrain themind
ingeneral iscalled “meditation,” andstudies ofmindfulness
meditation show how itsupports healthier functioning inthe
body, inthemind, andinrelationships. Forexample, research
hasshown thatthemore present weareinlife, thehigher the
level ofthe enzyme telomerase inour bodies, which
maintains and repairs the life-preserving ends ofour
chromosomes, called telomere caps. With theday-to-day
stresses oflife and thenatural progression oftheaging
process, these chromosome caps areslowly whittled down.
Building upmore telomerase canhelp usbehealthier andlive
134

longer. Some people have come bypresence naturally; others
may learn itthrough mindfulness training. For those who
were taught totrain their mind tobemindful, their ability to
bepresent was increased, their immune system functioned
better, andtheir level oftelomerase increased. Amazing, but
true: How you focus your mind’s attention inwardly can
change molecules inyour body thatmake youhealthier and
make your cells live longer.
With presence, too, ourability tobeaware ofouremotions
and make them work forusinstead ofagainst uswill be
improved. And ourability tofocus attention sowecanlearn
what wewant tolearn will bestrengthened. Asifthatwere
notenough, other studies ofmindfulness meditation show that
wewill beable toapproach, rather than withdraw from,
challenging situations and actually feel more meaning and
fulfillment inlife.Some people callthathappiness. Itisaway
ofliving alifeofmeaning, compassion, andpurpose. Simply
put, time-in helps us to be at our wisest.
Forourrelationships, time-in and themindful awareness it
creates will help usbecome more empathic with others. Not
only isthecompassion that arises from such askill set
directed atbeing aware ofothers’ feelings andhelping them
feel better, italso helps usfeel more compassionate toward
ourselves.
So,yes, time-in isafundamental part ofhaving mindsight.
And time-in isawin-win-win situation, helping ourbodies
andbrains, ourminds andinner lives, andourrelationships
with others. Iteven helps how werelate toourselves ina
kinder and more supportive way.
135

Why, then, isn’t every school teaching time-in practices?
Teachers could expand their focus beyond thetraditional
three R’sofreading, ’riting, and’rithmetic toteach reflection,
relationships, andresilience. Ithink thisisgenerally notbeing
done because people are simply not aware ofthese
scientifically proven outcomes ofsuch inner practices. And
teaching such internal education inschools would mean
taking astep back from routines and busy schedules and
creating anew approach toeducation overall. Yetthere isa
lotofresearch tosuggest thattaking time-in anddeveloping
the mindsight foundations of social and emotional
intelligence enhance academic achievement. Schools can
embrace these findings andsupport adolescents indeveloping
this prefrontal program that supports ahealthy mind. A
number ofinnovative programs arebeing adopted insome
schools tobring thisnew approach ofinternal education into
theclassroom. Since presence hasbeen proven topromote
happiness, thepresence thatsuch atime-in curriculum fosters
may even make ahappier setofstudents, and probably
teachers, too.
And asfamilies, wecanmake time-in apartofourdaily lives.
Inmany ways, parents aretheir children’s first teachers. So
why nothave this internal education begin athome for
everyone in the family?
There isnobetter place tobegin than with ourselves.
Mahatma Gandhi hadagreat saying: “We must bethechange
wewish toseeintheworld.” And with thisidea inmind, I
invite you tojoin meindeveloping these basic time-in
practices soyoucanbecome amindsight maven anddevelop
more presence inyour life. Whether youarebeginning your
adolescence orareinthemiddle ofit,whether youareatthe
136

end ofadolescence ordeep into adulthood, these time-in
practices canwork tobring presence into your life, catalyze
integration in your brain, and strengthen your mind.
Getting Started
First, I’dlike you tothink oftime-in asaregular daily
practice you aredoing toactivate themindsight circuits of
your brain. Abitlike brushing your teeth fororal hygiene,
time-in should beadaily habit thatyoujustdobecause itisa
needed partofahealthy life.When weexercise amuscle, the
repeated tightening then relaxing, tightening then relaxing of
themuscle ultimately strengthens it.There isnomuscle inthe
brain, butthepractice ofactivating andstrengthening apart
ofyour body isthesame idea forstrengthening thebrain.
Here thepractice isnotmoving amuscle butfocusing your
attention.
How youfocus your attention drives energy andinformation
flow through your nervous system. Where attention goes,
neural firing inthebrain occurs. Where neural firing happens,
neural connections arestrengthened. Attention istheway we
activate specific circuits inthebrain and strengthen them.
And when youstrengthen neural connections thatarelinking
differentiated areas ofthebrain toone another, you are
creating integration in the brain.
Put simply: Focusing your attention inregular time-in
practice can integrate your brain.
Time-in and themindful awareness and presence itcreates
willenable your brain toliterally grow more integrative fibers
that create your ability toregulate emotions, attention,
thinking, and behavior, and your sense ofwell-being and
connections toothers will beoptimized. Ifcarefully
137

conducted scientific studies didnotreveal this, Imyself
would look at this list and say, “That is too good to be true!”
But these positive outcomes have all been shown to be true.
Sothesimple question isthis: Areyouready togetstarted?
And ifyouare,please take your time, butlet’s getready now
to dive into time-in.
Being Present for What Is Happening as It Is Happening
Taking time-in canhappen atanymoment oftheday. IfIam
washing thedishes, Icansimply create theinternal stance,
called an“intention,” toletthisbeatime tomindfully wash
thedishes. What this means isthat Iwill lettheinternal
sensations oftheexperience fillmyawareness. When my
mind wanders andIbegin tothink about what Ididlastweek,
orwhat I’llbedoing next month, then Iamnolonger being
aware ofthepresent-moment experience, nolonger taking in
thesensations ofthewater orthedish soap orthedish inmy
138

hands atthatvery moment, nolonger allowing mymind tobe
filled only with awareness ofthesensations ofthatmoment.
Taking time-in and being mindful mean being present for
what is happening as it is happening.
You might bewondering: Couldn’t awareness ofone’s
thoughts about thepast orthefuture bewhat ishappening at
thatpresent moment? Ifso,isn’t thistaking time-in because
your thinking about thepast and future isinside you right
now? And because itiswhat is“happening asitis
happening,” doesn’t thisalsomean thatyouarebeing mindful
ofyour thoughts atthatvery moment? These questions have
yesanswers ifweareintending toletourminds wander on
purpose andarethen open towhatever arises inourthought
processes. Butifourintention istofocus onthesensations of
the experience ofwashing the dishes and our minds
unintentionally getdistracted asourattention wanders andour
awareness becomes filled with theuninvited focus onthepast
orthefuture, then no,thisisnotbeing mindful, andno,thisis
not what we mean by time-in practice.
When wetake time-in, weintentionally focus onsome aspect
ofourinner world. WeareSIFTing ourminds aswefocus at
least onsome aspect ofoursensations, images, feelings, and
thoughts. This ishow westrengthen ourability tobepresent,
tobeaware ofwhat ishappening asitishappening. Learning
tobepresent inlife, atanyage, will help usbecome more
resilient. Resilience means being flexible and strong inthe
face ofstress, anditiswhat weneed toapproach anyofthe
challenges oflifeand rise above adversity, learn from the
experience, andmove onwith vitality andpassion. These are
some ofthelikely reasons that, research hasshown, presence
creates happiness and well-being in our lives.
139

Before wecantake thesteps tobepresent with strength and
reliability, weneed tolearn thefirststepofpresence, which is
touseawareness tostabilize ourattention. This ishow we
strengthen the monitoring ability of the mind.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE A: Breath Awareness
Here arethebasic instructions forthistime-in practice with
breathing. Thetask istofocus onthesensation ofthebreath.
When themind gets distracted, take note ofthatandredirect
attention to the sensation of the breath.
That’s it.
This universal mindfulness ofthebreath approach can be
done sitting down orstanding up.Itcan bedone intwo
minutes ortwenty minutes. You candothisonce adayor
many brief times aday. Many people liketohave aregular
time tocarry outthisbreath practice andfind themornings
areagreat time todothis. Some researchers suggest thatthe
keytolong-term benefits isregular, daily practice. Some have
said thatforadults aminimum oftwelve minutes seems tobe
important each day. Butit’sbetter todoacouple ofminutes
each dayifthose daily dozen arenotpossible. Just aswith
aerobic exercise, while thirty toforty-five minutes adayis
ideal onaregular basis, ifyoudon’t have thattime, itisbetter
to do something each day rather than nothing.
Great. Sonow what doyoudowith your body while you’re
focusing your mind? Some people liketositcomfortably ina
chair, feetflatonthefloor, legs uncrossed, back straight but
comfortable. Some liketositonthefloor, legscrossed. And if
you cankeep from falling asleep, some with back troubles
liketolieflatonthefloor, legselevated either ontheseatofa
140

chair oronacushion toease thetension onthelower back
and knees. Whatever works for you is fine.
And what doyoudowith your eyes? Some liketokeep their
eyes open, some partially closed, andothers fully closed. Do
whatever works well foryou tofocus onthe breath’s
sensations. Since thefocus isontime-in, turn offanydigital
objects andtrytohave some time when youwon’t beeasily
distracted orinterrupted. You candothisalone, oryoucando
this with others. Whatever works is fine!
When itisnew toyou tofocus ontheseainside, itcanbe
challenging. Sowhile Iamsaying thisissimple, itdoesn’t
mean itiseasy. One challenging aspect ofthisexperience is
that wearesoused tofocusing ontheoutside world of
stimulating sounds and sights that focusing ontheinternal
world ofsensations canbelesscaptivating. Inshort, youmay
get bored!
Partofthepractice istomonitor ifyouarefalling asleep from
boredom. Please don’t become discouraged, butifyoudofeel
discouraged, oranything else forthatmatter, justbeopen to
whatever feelings arise. That’s what being present isall
about. Ifanyparticular feeling gets intheway ofyour focus
onthebreath, name ittotame itbysimply saying something
like “feeling discouraged” or“feeling anxious” orsimply
“feeling, feeling” andthen letthefeeling cease tobethefocus
ofyour attention byreturning tothebreath. Thekeyisnotto
trytogetridofsomething, likeafeeling ofdiscouragement,
butrather tobeopen toit,sense itassimply anobject of
attention, and then letyour mind redirect attention tothe
sensation of the breath.
141

Being mindful has asense ofkindness, apositive
regard toward yourself and others. Some people call this
self-compassion, meaning you arepatient with yourself and
realize thatyouarejusthuman. The mind hasamind ofits
own, and getting distracted isjust what itmeans tobea
person. Welcome tothehuman family! Soinstead ofbeating
yourself upforbeing “bad” attaking time-in, you should
simply acknowledge that your attention wandered tothe
conversation inthehallway, and then lovingly and gently
redirect theattention toward your breath. Again and again,
one breath at a time.
Mindful practice has the elements ofCOAL—that is,
being curious about what’s happening, being opentowhat is
going on,accepting thatthisisthepresent moment andletting
goofjudgments about it,andhaving aloving stance toward
theexperience, andyourself. This istheCOAL that warms
the experience of time-in.
Let’s Begin
(You may want toeither have someone read thistoyou as
youtrythepractice, orsimply record ityourself andlisten to
your own voice. Ifyou want tolisten tomespeaking a
version oftheTime-In with theBreath Awareness practice,
gotomy website, DrDanSiegel.com, and click onthe
Resources taband theeveryday mindsight tools and you’ll
find the breath awareness practice.)
The first time you dothis, getstarted with afocus onthe
visible outside world. With your eyes open, letyour attention
focus onthemiddle oftheroom. Now send your attention to
thefarwall orceiling. Now direct your visual attention tothe
middle oftheroom again. And now bring your attention to
142

about book reading distance, asifyou have abook or
magazine inyour hands. Notice how youcandirect thefocus
of attention.
Forthispractice, letthesensation ofthebreath betheobject
ofattention. Let’s begin atthelevel ofthenostrils with the
subtle sensation oftheaircoming inandgoing out.Ride the
wave ofthebreath, inandout,andjustsense thatsensation.
Now notice how youcandirect attention from thenostrils to
thechest. Letthesensation ofthechest rising andfalling fill
awareness. Upanddown, simply ride thewave ofthebreath
inandout.Now redirect attention totheabdomen. Ifyouare
new tothisabdominal breathing, youcanplace ahand onthe
belly andsimply notice how theabdomen moves outwhen air
fills thelungs, andtheabdomen moves inwhen airescapes
thelungs. Simply ride thewave ofthebreath byfocusing
attention onthesensation oftheabdomen moving outand
moving in.
Forthisbreath awareness practice, justletawareness become
filled with thesensation ofthebreath wherever itfeels most
natural. Itmay betheabdomen moving inandout,thechest
rising andfalling, ortheairatthenostrils. Oritmay simply
bethewhole body breathing. Just letthesensation ofthe
breath fill awareness wherever you feel it most readily.
143

144

Asyouridethewave ofthebreath, inandout,let’s take afew
moments tofocus onanancient story that’s been passed down
through thegenerations. Thestory goes likethis. Themind is
liketheocean. And deep beneath thesurface oftheocean, it
iscalm and clear. From this place ofclarity beneath the
surface, itispossible tojust look upand notice whatever
conditions areatthesurface. Itmay beflat, orchoppy with
waves, orthere may even beafullstorm, butnomatter the
conditions, deep beneath thesurface itremains calm and
clear.
Themind isliketheocean. And justsensing thebreath brings
youbeneath thesurface ofthemind. From thisdeep place in
themind, itispossible tonotice whatever surface activity is
happening inthe mind, such asfeelings orthoughts,
memories orideas. From thisdeep place beneath thesurface
ofthemind, itiscalm andclear. And justsensing thebreath
brings you to this place of clarity and tranquility.
Now let’s return toafocus ofattention onthesensation ofthe
breath wherever youfeelitmost readily. Justridethewave of
the breath, in and out.
Forthisbasic mindfulness ofthebreath practice, we’ll take
time-in tosimply letthesensation ofthebreath fillawareness.
When something distracts attention away from thebreath and
you’ve come tonotice thatawareness isnolonger filled with
thesensation ofthebreath, justnotice thedistraction andthen
letitgo,returning thefocus ofattention tothebreath and
filling awareness with the sensation of the breath.
We’ll practice this mindfulness ofthebreath now fora
fewminutes. (Ifyouhave atimer, youcansetittowhatever
duration you like, five minutes, adozen, twenty.) Asyou
145

experience thepractice, youmay find your attention goes to
something other than thebreath. For some, naming the
distraction helps toletitgo.Forothers, such naming isitself
adistraction. Ifyou choose togive this atry, itisoften
helpful togive thedistraction thesame general name asthe
kind ofdistraction that took your attention away. Soifa
memory ofbeing atthebeach distracts your attention, then
you can simply sayquietly inyour mind, “Remembering,
remembering, remembering,” and letthememory go.For
some, thiscanbehelpful tostrengthen their ability torelease
adistraction andreturn thefocus ofattention tothebreath.
Forothers, itisnothelpful andmay even bedistracting. Find
what works for you.
Remember, inaddition tothetask ofsimply focusing onthe
breath, itisrecommended that you consider regarding
yourself with kindness asyou gothrough this practice.
Everyone’s mind wanders attimes, and that isjust what it
means tobehuman. Infact, part ofthestrengthening aspect
ofthispractice comes from theredirecting ofattention, which
islikecontracting amuscle. Theunintentional distractions are
like relaxing amuscle, therefocusing onthebreath isthe
tightening ofthe muscle. Focus, distraction, refocus,
distraction, refocus again. That’s how wework outourminds
with thistime-in practice. This time-in canbenew tomany,
focusing ontheinternal sensations ofourmental lives. Ifyou
find yourself getting sleepy, youcanalways open your eyes a
bitifthey areclosed. And ifthatdoesn’t help toenergize the
mind, you cantrythisexercise standing up.Same practice,
only now you are vertical.
Let’s give this a try.
146

After adesignated period oftime, when you areready, you
cantake amore intentional andperhaps deeper breath andlet
your eyes come open, ifthey areshut, andwe’ll bring this
time-in breath awareness practice to a close.
How was thatforyou? Ifyouarenew tothis, welcome! As
wesaid, thismay besimple, butitisnoteasy formost ofus.
Themind does getdistracted easily, andthatisjustpartofthe
reality ofhaving ahuman mind. Tocarry outthispractice, we
train ourminds tobepresent. With repeated practice, this
mind-training exercise hasbeen shown togrow important
parts ofthebrain that areconnected notonly with attention
butwith emotion andempathy aswell. These areintegrative
circuits, andsothisbasic mindfulness ofthebreath practice
helps integrate thebrain. Itisaform ofbrain health, away of
creating mental resilience and well-being.
Building Mindsight’s Lens
Wecanthink oftaking time-in asaway ofbuilding thelens
thatenables ustoseetheseainside with more stability sothat
what weseeisinbetter focus andgives usmore detail and
depth. Think ofmindsight ashaving ametaphoric lens, one
that isstabilized with atripod. Each ofitsthree legs
represents anaspect ofwhat time-in creates forus.Having a
sense ofthese three factors ofastabilized attention canhelp
us as we practice time-in and strengthen our mindsight skills.
The first tripod legisopenness .This istheopenness inour
COAL work, how wearesimply open towhatever arises asit
arises. This isaninvitation tolethappen whatever will
happen, adeep presence tothe moment that embraces
whatever may stream into our awareness from attention.
147

Thesecond legisobjectivity .This isakin totheacceptance of
ourCOAL acronym inwhich wejust accept theobject of
attention intoourawareness. Wedon’t trytodistort what we
think ishappening; we simply letinto our awareness
whatever ishappening atthemoment andthen seeitasan
object ofourattention, asaknown inthelarger knowing of
conscious experience. When wedoour next mindsight
practice, this distinction between knowing and known will
become the focus of our experience.
The third legofthetripod thatstabilizes mindsight’s lens is
observation .When wearetracking ourdesignated goal fora
practice and paying attention toour intention, we are
observing our experience.

Interestingly, twodistinct circuits have been identified inthe
brain. One isasensing circuit thatstreams sensations directly
into awareness. Another circuit isanobserving circuit that
enables ustobear witness toanevent andtothen beable to
narrate that moment oftime inourlives ifwechoose. This
observing capacity gives usabitofdistance from direct
sensation sothatwemay bemore flexible inhow werespond.
149

Asoneofmystudents pointed out,thisishow we“own” an
experience—observe, witness, and narrate.
Itisthisobserving capacity thatletsusdosomething likethis
during atime-in practice ofthebreath: Ummm. Interesting
conversation inthehallway. Ineed totalktoSteve. ...Oh,
whoops [observing distraction] ...That’s right ...Iwant to
talk tohim, butthis isatime-in practice onthebreath
[witnessing] ...listening, listening, listening [narrating] ...
[observing circuit now redirects attention tobreath on
purpose] ...Now: Sensation ofbreath fills awareness asit
engages thesensing circuits thatfillawareness with theinput
ofsimply thesensations ofthebreath. Observer feels satisfied
that wearenow following theintention ofthis time-in
practice tofocus onthebreath bybeing aware ofthe
sensations ofthebreath. Now we’ve “owned” thetime-in
practice!
This distinction between sensing and observing may seem
subtle, butitturns outtobequite important. Time-in builds
both circuits, empowering ustosimply beintheflow of
sensations, andalso toobserve ourinner workings, such as
ourfocus ofattention, sothatwecanmodify them asneeded
depending onourintention. Being mindful embraces atleast
these two streams ofawareness, sensing andobserving. To
build thecapacity forboth abilities, we’ll turnnow tothenext
practice andexplore more about how tobuild ourmindsight
skills.
Integrating Consciousness with the Wheel of Awareness
Atime-in practice that isspecifically designed tointegrate
consciousness iscalled theWheel ofAwareness. Inourdaily
lives there aremany aspects ofourconscious experience, of
150

what weareaware ofandthenature ofourawareness itself.
When weallow these different aspects ofconsciousness, of
being aware, tobeseen fortheir unique qualities—like
distinguishing vision from hearing, sensing thebody from
thinking—and then weconnect them through systematically
focusing attention oneach within awareness, wedevelop a
more coherent sense ofourselves. This iswhat Imean when I
sayintegrate consciousness. It’sthelinking ofthedifferent
elements ofbeing aware into aharmonious whole. Itisquite
simple butquite empowering asitintegrates ourminds. The
wheel practice ismore elaborate than thebreath practice
offered intheprior practice entry, buttaken together, they
make agood pair ofmind-strengthening time-in exercises.
Mysuggestion toyouisthatifyouhave notworked onthe
time-in with thebreath awareness practice foraweek orso,
youmay want todothatbefore trying outthewheel practice.
Some justdive inanditgoes well, butthispractice isboth a
bitlonger—it cantake about twenty minutes orsoinitsfull
form—and a bit more elaborate.

Wheel of Awareness
The hub represents the experience ofknowing within
awareness; thespokes arefocused attention; therimisthe
known, including sensations andother mental processes. The
sectors oftherimareasfollows: first through fifth (outer
world), sixth (body), seventh (mental activity), and eighth
(relationships) senses. From Daniel J.Siegel, M.D., The
Mindful Brain ,copyright ©2007 byMind Your Brain, Inc.
Adapted with permission.
Inmyoffice atwork there’s atable with aglass center andan
outer wood rim. When youlook through theglass, thelegs of
thetable appear likespokes connecting thiscenter hubtothe
outer rim. One daythattable seemed tobeagood metaphor
forconsciousness. Asanimage, thehubcould represent the
sense ofknowing inconsciousness, therimcould stand for
theknown (like afeeling orthought ormemory), and the
152

spokes could betheprocess ofattention that streams the
known into the knowing.
Asintegration isthedifferentiation andthen linkage ofparts
ofasystem, how can weintegrate consciousness? Ata
minimum, consciousness orbeing aware hastwocomponents:
oursense ofknowing andthatwhich isknown. Wecanuse
attention tolink these differentiated aspects ofconsciousness
toeach other. Itisalso possible todifferentiate thedifferent
elements oftheknown, represented inourmetaphoric wheel
ontherim, into four segments. This process ofcreating a
linkage ofthedifferentiated parts ofbeing aware creates a
powerful state ofintegration inourminds and cansoothe
anxiety, create clarity, andopen usuptobeing present inlife
with strength and resilience. The first segment oftherim
represents thefirstfivesenses, sight, hearing, smell, taste, and
touch. Thesecond segment oftherimcontains theinterior of
thebody—what iscalled the“sixth sense”—that includes the
inner sensations ofourmuscles andbones, andoftheinternal
organs such asintestines, lungs, andheart. Athird segment
represents our mental processes offeelings, thoughts and
memories, intentions, beliefs, and attitudes—our “seventh
sense.” And afourth segment canalso bedifferentiated and
represents akind ofrelational sense, our “eighth sense,”
where weperceive theconnections wehave with other people
and with our natural environment, our planet.
How could these various knowns ofthe rim actually
beconnected totheknowing ofthehub? That would bethe
distinct butrelated process ofattention. Attention isthe
process that directs theflow ofenergy andinformation. We
focus attention from thehubofknowing inawareness toward
therimoftheknown. And when wedothisinasystematic
153

way, a“rim review,” wethen linkthedifferentiated elements
ofconsciousness. That ishow theWheel ofAwareness
practice integrates consciousness.
SoIoffer this wheel practice toyou asaninvitation to
explore your own inner life—and tointegrate consciousness.
Thewheel hasbeen vetted bymymindfulness colleagues asa
mindfulness practice, butitwas notdesigned tobethat.
Preliminary research suggests italso haspowerful positive
effects onhow weregulate ouremotions andhelps develop a
clear mind—two outcomes ofintegration. The Wheel of
Awareness wascreated tointegrate consciousness andoffer a
systematic way of exploring the sea inside.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE B: The Wheel of Awareness
You canrecord thispractice yourself andlisten toit,oryou
can simply gotoDrDanSiegel.com and download it.This
practice takes about twenty minutes, soitcertainly offers you
onevariation ondoing your daily dozen. Ifyoudon’t have the
twenty minutes, you can also doone segment oftherim
review only, tailoring ittoyour needs asyougo.And there is
even away tomove more quickly through therimifneeded,
covering itallbutmaking thepractice more like adozen
minutes, byletting alternate breaths beyour guide fortiming
themovement ofyour spoke inreviewing thesensations of
theoutside world andbody. Isuggest starting with thefull
timing togetfamiliar with thewheel andthen modifying your
practice tofityour needs. You choose what works best for
you.
We’ll begin the practice here.
Intheillustration oftheWheel ofAwareness (p.129), you’ll
find adrawing ofthetable inmyoffice that serves as
154

thewheel forourpractice. Take alook atthewheel, andlet’s
review itsparts. The hub represents the experience of
knowing within awareness. The rimrepresents anything you
can beaware of,such assights orsounds, thoughts or
feelings. And thespokes represent attention, theway youcan
stream energy and information from the rim into the hub.
Let’s focus onthebreath forafewwaves oftheinbreath and
the out breath. Ifyou’ve been practicing time-in with
thebreath, you’ll beready tosense thebreath wherever you
feel itmost naturally. Now that deep place beneath the
surface ofthemind, theplace where sensing thebreath can
take youtonotice whatever arises onthesurface, islikethe
hubofthewheel. And justsensing thebreath brings youto
thehub ofthemind. Now letthebreath go,and simply
visualize orimagine theidea oftheWheel ofAwareness, with
itscentral hubofclarity, thespokes ofattention, andtherim.
We’ll now begin our rim review toexplore each ofthe
segments of the rim.
Imagine sending aspoke ofattention tothefirst segment of
therim, that part that hassight, hearing, smell, taste, and
touch. Let’s begin with hearing, letting any sounds inthe
room fill awareness ...
Now move theimaginary spoke over abitinthis first
segment andletthelight coming inthrough your eyelids, or
slightly opened eyes, fill awareness ...
Now move the spoke again and letany odors fill
awareness ...
And now move thespoke tothesense oftaste, letting any
tastes fill awareness ...
155

Now letanywhere where skin istouching something,
touching clothes, touching achair, touching skin, letthesense
of touch fill awareness ...
Now taking abitofadeeper breath, we’ll letthis first
segment oftherimgoandmove thespoke over tothesecond
segment oftherim. Let’s begin byfocusing attention onthe
facial area. Letthesensations ofthemuscles andbones ofthe
face fillawareness. Now move attention tothescalp, andlet
thesensations from thetopofthehead fillawareness. And
now focus attention ontheback ofthehead andsides, filling
awareness with those sensations. Now moving attention tothe
muscles andbones oftheneck andthroat, fillawareness with
their sensations.
Letattention now gototheshoulder area, letting themuscles’
and bones’ sensations fill awareness. And now stream
attention down both arms, totheelbows ...wrists ...andthe
ends ofthefingers ...Now bring attention tothemuscles and
bones oftheupper back and thechest ...And now tothe
lower back and theabdomen ...Now send attention to
thehips, anddown both legs totheknees andtheankles and
theends of the toes ...
Now bring attention tothepelvic area, filling awareness with
thesensation from thegenitals ...andnow move attention
inward, totheintestines, letting these gutsensations fill
awareness ...Now letattention gotothestomach ...and
now uptotheinterior ofthethroat. ..And now letattention
move totheinterior ofthelungs ...And now center attention
intheheart region, andjustletthose heartfelt sensations fill
awareness ...
156

And now letawareness become filled with theinterior ofthe
whole body, from head to toes ...
Knowing thatthebody’s signals areadeep source ofwisdom
always available toyou, we’ll letthissegment oftherimgo
asyoutake adeeper breath andmove thespoke ofattention
over tothethird segment oftherim. This isthesegment that
represents your mental life offeelings and thoughts,
memories and intentions. Whatever themind cancreate is
represented here. Forthisaspect oftherimreview, we’ll have
two parts.
Inthefirst part, you’ll send thespoke from thehub tothe
third segment oftherim. Then you’ll simply invite into
awareness inthehubwhatever may arise, whatever comes up
toenter awareness. Inmany ways, thisistheopposite ofthe
breath-awareness practice where you intentionally focus on
thebreath, and when amental process—like athought or
memory—distracts attention, youletitgoandreturn thefocus
ofattention tothebreath. Here youaresimply being open to
whatever mental lifemay ormay notcome into awareness.
It’slike aninternal open stance of“Bring iton.” Just sense
whatever may arise inawareness. Let’s dothat forafew
minutes ...
Forthesecond part ofthis aspect oftherimreview, we’ll
again invite anything into awareness from thisthird segment
oftherim. Now, though, I’llinvite youtoalso study theways
inwhich amental activity isexperienced inawareness. How
does itfirst come into awareness? Does itcome suddenly or
gradually? From one side oranother? And once itisin
awareness, how does itstay there? Isitconstant orvibrating,
isitsteady orintermittent? And then how does itleave
awareness? Suddenly, orgradually, orisitjustreplaced by
157

another mental activity, another thought ormemory orfeeling
orimage? Ifitisnotreplaced byanother mental activity, what
does thespace feel like between two mental activities in
awareness?
Soforthispartoftherimreview, I’minviting youtobecome
astudent ofthearchitecture ofyour own mental life. Let’s
begin that practice now for a few minutes ...
Now Iinvite you tofind thebreath, inandout, andtake a
deeper breath asweletthissegment oftherimgofornow
and move thespoke over, one more time, tothefourth
segment oftherim. This isthepartoftherimthatrepresents
oursense ofconnection toothers and toourenvironment.
First, ifthere arepeople intheroom near you, letthesense of
closeness tothem fillawareness. Now letthat sense of
connection expand toyour relationships with friends and
family ...Now letthatsense ofconnection move outtoyour
classmates ifyou areinschool, ortoyour work
colleagues ...And now letthatsense ofconnection open to
allthose who liveinyour community ...inyour city...in
your state orprovince ...inyour country ...onyour
continent ...
Now letthatsense ofconnection open uptoallpeople who
share thishome wecallplanet Earth ...And now seeifyou
can expand that sense ofconnection toallliving beings,
animals andplants, who share ourcommon home, thisplanet,
together ...
Knowing that scientific research hasvalidated what wisdom
traditions throughout theworld have taught forcenturies, that
positive intentions and wishes forthewell-being ofothers
lead notonly topositive changes intheworld butalso to
158

health benefits toyourself, Iinvite you toimagine sending
wishes ofkindness forhealth and happiness, safety and
well-being toallliving beings onEarth ...And now, taking a
bitofadeeper breath, sending kindness andcompassionate
wishes ofhealth andhappiness, safety andwell-being toyour
own inner self...Now let’s find thebreath andridethewave
ofthe breath, inand out...And taking now amore
intentional andperhaps deeper breath, we’ll bring thisWheel
of Awareness practice to a close for today.
Reflecting on the Wheel
One amazing thing about theWheel ofAwareness practice is
thateach time youdoit,itisdifferent. People from allwalks
oflifefrom allover theplanet have shared thechallenges and
thebenefits ofthepractice. You canseeforyourself what
doing thispractice islike, andonly youcansayifitisuseful
to you in some way.
When adolescents have reported ontheir experience with the
wheel, they’ve told methat thesense ofthehub hasgiven
them akind offreedom from whatever might becoming up
ontherim. One twenty-one-year-old said that heranxiety
about being with other people was greatly reduced because
her“nervousness andworries justbecame points ontherim
that Icould sense from that calmer place onthehub.” And
sheisnotalone. Many people, adolescents andadults alike,
have reported allsorts ofrelief from painful emotions and
even painful bodily sensations when they’ve strengthened the
hub of their mind.
There isamore advanced practice, Wheel ofAwareness III
(with thehub-on-hub practice included), inwhich you are
invited toexperience sending thespoke outfrom thehub,
159

only thistime itisbent back toreturn tothehubitself. This is
how youarefocusing attention onawareness, andexperience
what awareness of awareness feels like.
Forpeople new totime-in practices ofreflection inwardly,
such anadvanced awareness oftheawareness part ofthe
wheel may betoomuch atfirst. Rather than frustrating
someone new tothisimportant reflective work, Ijustleave
outthatmore advanced step fortheinitial experience. Butif
you’ve been practicing thebreath awareness forawhile and
feel that itworks well foryou, andifyou’ve tried outthe
wheel forawhile andfeelready foramore challenging aspect
of that process, you may be ready to try out Wheel III.
Isuggest thatifyoufeelready, goahead tothewebsite and
give itatry.That bending ofthespoke tocome back tothe
hub isgenerally done after thefourth segment oftherimis
reviewed, justbefore theendofthewhole practice. It’sbest
todothewhole wheel first, andthen addthishub-on-hub part
attheend sothat your mind isprepared. Just letyourself
sense whatever focusing attention onawareness itself feels
like. After acouple ofminutes, letyourself find thebreath
again, inandout,andthen, when youareready, take amore
intentional andperhaps deeper breath andletyour eyes come
open ifthey’re shut, and letthewheel practice come toa
close.
There aremany other forms oftaking time-in onaregular
basis, including focusing onbeing more compassionate with
yourself andothers inasystematic way. Even when youare
inmotion there areways totake time-in. You canmindfully
walk byfocusing ontheinternal sensations from thebottoms
ofyour feet with each step. And you candoother mindful
movement practices that encourage you tofocus onyour
160

intentions, awareness, andsensations. Focusing attention on
your intention, being aware ofyour awareness, andstaying
present with astance ofkindness and compassion arethe
essential elements of time-in practices. Each of these practices
offers aresearch-proven way toempower your life. Many
studies suggest thattaking time daily, even justthree minutes
several times each day, tofocus mindfully onyour breath can
greatly support your well-being. Time-in integrates your
brain, improves your relationships, and strengthens your
mind. Insomany ways, taking time-in onadaily basis isthe
powerful starting place to create more integration in your life.
161

PART III
Your Attachments
Close relationships shape usacross thelifespan. Learning
about thefundamental ways ourconnections toothers can
enrich ourlives asthey support ahealthy mind and likely
promote integration inourbrains canguide usincreating the
relationships that arebest forusnomatter ourage. Our
experiences inthefirst dozen orsoyears ofourlives have a
powerful impact onthepeople webecome. Friendships,
experiences inschool, activities we participate in,and
relationships with family members allinfluence how our
brains develop during theyears leading uptoadolescence.
Buteven after these early years, relationships continue toplay
acrucial role inourgrowth and development. Inthis part
we’ll explore how theways werelate toourcaregivers shape
how our minds develop toreveal some basic guiding
principles ofrelationships. The great news isthat by
understanding what happened toyouandhow youresponded
tothose experiences inthepast, youcanopen your lifenow
tomore productive andhealthy ways ofrelating toothers, and
even to yourself.
Especially influential in terms of how the brain
develops—and, inturn, how welearn tocalm ouremotions,
how weunderstand ourselves, and how werelate toothers
and thelarger world—are ourexperiences during infancy.
The relationships wehave with ourparents andother people
who care foruswhen wearevery young most directly shape
who webecome. Butitiscrucial tokeep inmind that our
minds are continually emerging, our brains continually
growing inresponse toexperience, andwhether you arean
162

adolescent oranadult now, how youmake sense ofyour life
andunderstand these patterns ofconnecting with others can
empower you to optimize how you live.
Ifyou areanadolescent still living with aparent, you may
feelintense andcomplex emotions asyouexplore these ideas
about family lifestill going oninthepresent. Ialso know,
from personal experience asaparent, thatreflecting onways
weparent ourchildren andadolescents canbechallenging as
weface some attimes non-ideal patterns ofcommunicating
thathave been present inourparenting approach. Naturally,
wewant todowell with our kids. But doing well may
sometimes elude usifwe’ve hadchallenging experiences in
ourown past. Somuch ofwhat I’ve tried toexplore inearlier
books ishow important itisforustobehonest with ourselves
andopen totheimportant continuing growth wecanmodel
forouroffspring. There isnosuch thing asperfect parenting.
Butthere isaway tomake sense ofourlives sothatwemove
toward authentic ways ofrelating that aresupportive ofour
kids andourselves. Soplease keep thisinmind: Itisnever too
latetocourse correct, tocome toadeeper understanding and
enhance theway weconnect inourfamilies with thepeople
welove and care sodeeply about. Ifchange were not
possible, there wouldn’t bemuch reason todive into this
material. But science and experience reveal that with
self-reflection and understanding, non-ideal patterns we’ve
adopted from ourown pasts canbetransformed. Bepatient
with yourself andwith your family members. With kindness
andunderstanding, toyourself andtoothers, change canbe
nurtured and good things can emerge.
Connections with others, ourrelationships, come inmany
forms. These important connections with ourparents orother
163

caregivers arecalled “attachment relationships.” We carry
these selective fewattachment relationships forward inside us
inwhat arecalled “models ofattachment.” Theterm “model”
broadly means the mental way, shaped bybrain-firing
patterns, thatwesummarize across experiences andgenerate a
schema thatletsusanticipate what ishappening next, how we
should behave, what emotions wewill have, and how we
filter ourperceptions. Models arereally useful inlearning and
knowing how tobehave, andthey often influence ourways of
seeing and being in the world without our awareness.
Anattachment model isineffect theway inwhich ourbrains
remember theattachment relationship(s) wehave had, orstill
have, andhow wehave adapted tothese formative attachment
experiences. The models wecarry with usinourminds are
very influential interms ofhow wefeel, how wethink, how
webehave, andhow weconnect with friends, teachers, and
later on,ourromantic partners aswemove through ourlives.
And since wecanhave more than onemodel ifwe’ve had
more than one attachment figure, then each ofthese brain
states, these models, caninfluence how webehave andreact
in different situations.
Ourattachment models getactivated inspecific situations that
may resemble theparticular kind ofattachment relationship
wehadinthepast, andthen they shape how weinteract in
thatpresent moment. Ifwearewith anassertive older female
friend, forexample, wemay begin acting aswedidwith our
mother, who, too,may have been anassertive personality. In
contrast, ifweadapted toamild-mannered father with our
own withdrawal, with aquiet male friend wemight find
ourselves becoming withdrawn andnoteven know thereason
why. Models become engaged automatically, without our
164

awareness orintention. Forallofus,adolescents andparents,
understanding what kinds ofattachment models we
constructed inour early childhood can greatly help us
understand how ourlives areunfolding now, and how we
might create anew way ofliving thatfrees usfrom anykind
of limitations such models may be making in our lives.
There aretwobroad types ofmodels, onesecure andtheother
non-secure. Secure models support ourliving with flexibility,
self-understanding, and ease ofconnection with others.
Non-secure models come inseveral forms we’ll explore here,
andeach ofthese insome ways challenges ourability tobe
flexible, understand ourselves, and connect with others.
Because wecanhave many models and their activation is
dependent onthesituation wefind ourselves in,wecanseem
quite different in different settings with different people.

Inmany ways, developing secure attachment models isan
important way tosupport theESSENCE ofadolescence. With
security ouremotional spark canbefreed toenrich ourlives
with passion rather than pushing ustoward states ofbeing
chaotically overwhelmed orrigidly shut down. With secure
models, too, wecan have social engagements that are
mutually rewarding andenable ustofeelboth differentiated
andlinked within theintegrative social connections thathelp
usthrive asadolescents. Wewillseethatsecure attachment is
asmuch about offering asafe harbor ofsupport, toturn to
when wearedistressed ortired, asitisabout supporting how
wegoout and explore theworld. With such asecure
launching pad, wecantake onourdrive toseek novelty with
more gusto andstrength. Security supports thedevelopment
ofaresilient mind. And asourminds find new ways of
experiencing how we think and reflect onlife during
adolescence, having secure attachment models can support
our creative explorations during this new period ofour
growth.
Inthis part we’ll explore what your experiences with
attachment figures inyour lifehave been andwhat attachment
models youmay have now. We’ll then seehow wecanuse
this understanding and specific strategies todevelop secure
attachment models that setthefoundations ofresilience and
support theESSENCE ofadolescence tohelp youcreate alife
that’s best for you, whatever your age.
Safe Harbor and Launching Pad
Ihave anaquarium inmyoffice andIlove tositandstare at
thefishasthey swim about. Interestingly, while some fishdo
care fortheir young, myfish aretypical ofmost fish (and
reptiles and amphibians, forthat matter) that fertilize their
167

eggs, deposit them inthesand, andleave them tofend for
themselves after they hatch. Wemammals arevery different.
Akeyfeature ofourmammalian heritage isthat ouryoung
require theclose care ofanadult figure, often themother,
who provides safety and nurturance. That’s attachment.
One important feature ofhuman child rearing isthatwedon’t
just have one attachment figure asmost mammals do.We
humans practice what iscalled alloparenting, which means
“other parenting,” sharing child rearing with other trusted
adults orolder children. This ability iscrucial forusasa
social species and may have shaped how weevolved asa
species ingeneral interms ofour unique abilities for
communicating and building collaborative
relationships. Alloparenting also means that wecan have
attachments tomore than just our mother; wecan form
attachments toaselective fewolder, stronger, andhopefully
wiser individuals towhom weturn forprotection and
comfort.
Ascomplex social creatures, wehave avery extended period
ofdependency onourattachment figures. The human brain
needs therelationships with ourattachment figures andother
adults toshape how itgrows. Our childhood period of
dependency goes onforagood 15percent ofourlifetime—a
really long time inmammalian terms. And ifweinclude the
period ofadolescence, now extended into thetwenties, that
percentage before wereach adult status inoursociety is
higher still, approaching a third of our lives.
Human attachment canbeunderstood asinvolving four S’s.
Weneed tobeseen,safe,andsoothed ,inorder tofeelsecure .
Being seen means thatourinner mental lifeissensed beneath
ourbehavior. Our caregiver hears ourcry, figures outwhat
168

ourinner need is,andthen offers ussomething thatmeets that
need. Being safe means weareboth protected from harm and
notterrified byourcaregiver. Tobesoothed means thatwhen
wearedistressed, ourcaregiver’s response makes usfeel
better. When weneed comfort, wegetahug. And allof
this—being seen, safe, andsoothed inareliable way—gives
us an overall sense of security in the relationship.
These ways ourattachment figures treat usgive usasense of
asafe harbor inwhich wecanfeel secure. But attachment
relationships alsoserve asalaunching padfrom which wecan
take offand explore theworld. When wehave asecure
attachment model, wehave thesecurity toventure outintoall
thatliesahead intheworld beyond ourhome. And when we
aretired, ordistressed, orjustneed totouch base, wereturn to
thesafeharbor ofourattachment home, ourrelationships with
our attachment figures.
Aswegrow from infancy into toddlerhood, this sense of
security inourrelationship isinternalized inourbrains ina
“state ofmind” thatissecure. Wefeelgood about ourselves,
good about connecting with others, andfeel that ourneeds
will bemet. Even more, inahumble and solid versus
demanding andentitled way, wefeel we’ll beable tohave
connections with others who will seeourminds, feel our
feelings, andmeet ourneeds. This isthesolid sense ofself
that emerges for those with secure attachment models.
169

When wehitadolescence, having asecure attachment model
can beareal blessing aswegooutinto theworld and
experience allthemany changes thatbecoming anadolescent
means andwhat thejourney toward adulthood may entail. If
we’ve hadsecure attachment inourearlier childhood, then we
enter these early adolescent stages with amore secure model,
astate ofmind that isfilled with many oftheprefrontal
functions that emerge with integration strong and
well-developed. Science hasshown thatsecure attachment is
associated with the integrative prefrontal functions that
include regulating thebody, attuning toothers andourselves,
balancing ouremotions, being flexible, soothing ourfears,
having insight into ourselves and empathy forothers, and
having a good grounding in a sense of morality.
Toputthis proposal inanutshell, when we’ve had secure
attachments, ourrelational experiences have supported the
development ofintegration inthebrain andresilience ofour
170

mind. When we have had insecure attachments, the
development ofour non-secure models reflects states of
non-integrated brain functioning. You canseethebasic idea
here: Ifyou’ve hadahistory ofinsecure attachment, togrow
toward security happens bymoving from non-integrated brain
functioning tothedevelopment ofintegration inyour brain.
And that development can potentially happen at any age.
Secure attachment confers resilience asitlikely stimulates the
growth ofintegrative connections oftheprefrontal cortex.
Recall that theprefrontal region links cortex, limbic area,
brainstem, body, and even the social world into one
coordinated and balanced whole. This isthe power of
attachment relationships tocreate healthy and adaptive
functions inourlives, functions thatemerge from integration
in our brains.
While entering adolescence with asecure model of
attachment makes itmore likely that theadolescent period
will besmoother, itdoes notguarantee it.Resilience is
important, butitdoes notconfer absolute immunity tothe
many curve balls lifesends ourway. Aswe’ve seen, the
remodeling period ofdevelopment thatoccurs inadolescence
can play arole intheemergence ofmany challenges to
well-being, including the onset ofvarious psychiatric
conditions such asmood, anxiety, andthought disorders, as
well asdrug abuse andaddiction. These conditions arenot
caused byattachment and their onsets arenotnecessarily
prevented bysecure attachment. Any ofthese canemerge
even with ahistory ofsecure attachment, asmany other
factors inlifeinfluence ourdevelopment besides attachment,
such asourtemperament, ourextended social relationships,
our socioeconomic status, our genetics, and our use of
171

dopamine-activating substances. Studies suggest, for
example, that certain variations inourgenetic makeup that
influence ways weprocess dopamine, serotonin, oroxytocin
may have adirect effect onhow werespond tocertain
challenging experiences inlife. Attachment isoneimportant
element ofourlives, butnotthewhole story. Still, since
attachment influences somuch, andbecause wecanactively
empower ourlives asweshape ourattachment models ina
positive way, knowing about attachment isvital foranyofus.
You may notbeable toalter your genes, butyou canalter
your mind andyour behavior tochange your brain. Inother
words, your attachment models arechangeable, andknowing
about your attachment models iscrucial sothatyoucanmove
them toward security whatever your age.
Forabout one-half totwo-thirds ofthegeneral population,
secure attachment iswhere westart outinlife. Ifthat is
mostly where you’ve come from, you’ve gotagreat starting
place toenter adolescence, aboost inyour ability tobe
resilient when lifethrows challenges your way. Butforabout
one-third toone-half ofus,which means about 150 million
people intheUnited States alone, wehave had attachment
relationships thatwere notsecure. These insecure attachments
don’t necessarily mean thatweareinsecure onthewhole as
people, itsimply means that wedidn’t consistently receive
those S’sofbeing seen, safe, andsoothed, andsodidnotfeel
secure inour primary attachment relationships. Our
non-secure models ofattachment reflect how wehadtoadapt
tothis insecure relationship when wewere younger. And
these models ofattachment persist throughout ourlives. They
are changeable, yes, but only if we come to understand them.
172

With ahistory ofinsecure attachment, ourbrains may not
enter theadolescent period with thesame baseline integrative
growth that asecurely attached person has been able to
develop inchildhood. The great news isthat itisnever too
latetodevelop integration inourbrains! Wecanmove from
non-secure models of attachment, those states of
non-integrated brain functioning, tosecure, integrated models
bydeveloping integration inourbrains. One way wecando
this istomake sense ofwhat hashappened inourlives.
Making sense moves usfrom anon-secure, non-integrated
model ofattachment toaplace ofsecurity andanintegrated
model of attachment.
Inthispart, we’ll explore your lifehistory andtrytomake
sense ofthedifferent kinds ofattachment thatyoumay have
experienced inyour childhood andtheattachment models that
may now beapartofyour internal world. Whether youarean
adolescent still living with your attachment figures, your
parents orothers, oryou areanolder adolescent oradult
living away from your attachment figures, making sense of
your lifeisascience-proven way tomove from non-secure to
secure models ofattachment. It’saway ofintegrating your
brain and empowering your life.
The Ways We Attach
There arefour broad ways webecome attached toourparents
orothers who care forus.Forsimplicity, Iwillusually usethe
term “parent,” even though you may have hadanumber of
caregivers, bethey your mother andfather, relatives, friends,
orothers who took care ofyouandtowhom youturned when
youneeded comfort andprotection. Aswe’ve seen, ourbrains
are capable ofmaintaining several different models of
attachment, oneforeach relationship toagiven attachment
173

figure. Soasweexplore these four ways ofbeing attached to
ourcaregivers, keep inmind thatyou, likemany ofus,may
actually have more than one ofthese models inside you
shaping your inner sense ofselfandhow yourelate toothers.
The setting youarein,how people respond toyou, andhow
people remind youofoneofyour attachment figures canall
directly influence which ofthese models becomes activated at
a particular time.
The Secure Model
Ifyou hadarelationship with aparent who inasomewhat
consistent way provided you with asense ofbeing seen,
feeling safe, andbeing soothed, then youwillhave amodel of
secure attachment. This secure model letsyou balance your
emotions, understand yourself well, andengage with others in
mutually rewarding ways. Attachment continues across the
lifespan, buttogive you asense ofhow thefundamental
research isdone, here’s abrief summary ofhow attachment is
assessed during infancy: After about athree-minute
separation from thecaregiver, theone-year-old infant seeks
contact with thecaregiver during their reunion, touches base
174

forcomfort, and then readily returns toexploring aroom
filled with toys. The researchers view this interactive
behavior asevidence ofasecure attachment model inthe
child thatisactivated inthepresence ofthisparticular parent.
Theidea isthattheparent hasprovided both asafe haven and
alaunching pad; thechild feels seen, safe, soothed, and
secure with thisparent. This learned model isthen activated
sothatthechild makes contact, feels secure, andlaunches out
to explore the world of new toys in the room.
From infancy on,wecarry these models forward asthey help
usorganize ourapproach torelationships throughout thelife
span.
The Avoidant Model
Ifyou had asimilar experience growing uptoabout 20
percent ofthegeneral population, youhadarelationship with
oneorboth parents thatwas filled with repeated experiences
ofyour notbeing seen orsoothed. Here theform ofinsecure
relationship iscalled “avoidant attachment.” This term comes
from research findings inwhich investigators observed
one-year-old infants who were separated from their father or
mother later avoiding that parent when heorshereturned,
rather than reconnecting andseeking comfort from theparent,
ashappened inthesecure relationships. Here thenotion is
thatthechild’s experience ofnotbeing seen orsoothed over
the first year oflife with this parent has led tothe
development ofanon-secure model ofattachment—in this
case, anavoidant model. Inthepresence ofthat parent, the
child activates amodel ofavoidance. This isalearned
response quite adaptive for the child’s survival.
175

It’simportant tonote thatinthese studies itwasalsoseen that
several oftheinfants who avoided oneparent actually sought
comfort andcloseness with theother parent. Inother words, if
you have anavoidant attachment model asaresult ofyour
relationship with oneparent, thisdoesn’t mean thatyoucan’t
have asecure attachment with your other parent, enabling you
togothrough lifeknowing what atruly secure relationship
feels like. But with avoidant models and the avoidant
relationships they grow from, you’ve learned something very
different. With arepeated setofexperiences where interacting
with thatparent, sayyour father, isnotsoothing when youare
distressed, andnotconnecting when youfeelunseen, then the
model you develop says something like, “Idon’t need this
person foranything, because Ihave learned thathegives me
nothing when Ineed connection orcomfort.” You learned to
minimize your attachment needs. Having thisavoidant model
asyour model forclose relationships canpotentially lead you
tofeel disconnected from others and also from your own
emotions andneeds. That’s thedisconnected selfofavoidant
attachment.
Let’s highlight again here that your attachment model isa
summary ofhow you’ve adapted totherelationships you’ve
hadwith important people inyour life. It’snot, however, a
sign ofsome problem you have inside you—it’s merely a
reflection ofalearned response toreal-life events, toyour
actual relationship inyour early days. Furthermore, itdoes
notmean you arenow devoid ofaneed forcloseness and
comfort. While these models may becortical adaptations that
shape our external behaviors and our awareness, studies
reveal that thelimbic area that mediates attachment still
retains adeep drive forconnection with others. Weallneed to
feelclose tothepeople around usandknow thatwecanrely
176

onthem forcomfort. That’s justbeing human. Inthisrespect,
theself-knowledge thatcomes from realizing youmay have
been living your lifefollowing anavoidant model canbevery
empowering. Itcan allow you tosearch thequiet, often
hidden signals inside you that you may want closer
connection with others. Sensing these signals may help you
release your avoidant model soyoucanseek outfrom others
what you need inlifeasyou mature andage. The avoidant
model was good anduseful during your early years; now it
needs updating. Reflecting onthese patterns can beone
important step inenabling youtotransform your non-secure
attachment models toward security.
The Ambivalent Model
Athird type ofrelationship iswhen achild experiences
inconsistency orintrusiveness with aparent, asoccurs in
around 15percent ofthegeneral population. Being seen, safe,
and soothed does nothappen inareliable way. When the
parent returns after aseparation, yougotoher,butyoucling
toherbecause you areuncertain whether she’ll meet your
needs forcomfort. Maybe shewill, butmaybe shewon’t.
Better hold on!Your ambivalent model ofattachment does
notallow youtobecome soothed asyounever know what to
expect—she isnotareliable safeharbor. And herfeelings and
emotions flood your own inner world aswell. Forexample, if
you feel hungry, instead ofyour mom justfiguring that out
andfeeding you, shegets flooded with herown anxiety and
fears about whether shewill beaneffective mother foryou.
Since thehuman brain iscomposed of“mirror neurons” that
soak upthefeelings ofothers around us,younaturally sponge
upheranxiety andfear. Allyouwere feeling washunger, but
after interacting with your mom younow also feelfearful and
177

anxious. Whose feelings arewhose? That’s theconfused self
created within ambivalent attachment relationships. You
amplify your attachment needs with ambivalence because of
thehistory ofintrusiveness and inconsistency. Maybe this
time shecansoothe you, butmaybe not, butmaybe so,but
maybe ... That’s ambivalence.
The Disorganized Model
Thefourth kind ofattachment canoccur within thesetting of
theother three—secure, avoidant, orambivalent. Besides
those baseline experiences ofattachment, something else is
going on.For avariety ofreasons, your parent, sayyour
mom, isterrifying toyou. This could bebecause she is
depressed and irritable and runs after you, yelling atyou
when yougethome from school. This could bebecause sheis
screaming atyour father oryour siblings andnotatyou. And
thiscould bebecause shejustlooks terrified herself andyou
sponge herterror upinside you. The problem with being
terrified ofanattachment figure isthat itactivates two
different circuits inyour brain thatjustdon’t work together.
One istheancient brainstem circuit thatmediates asurvival
reaction. This circuit gets youtofleeorfreeze inreaction to
being terrified. Getaway from thissource ofterror! Butthe
second circuit isthelimbic-based attachment system that
motivates you ifyou are terrified togotoward your
attachment figure tobeprotected andsoothed. Theproblem is
youcannot goboth toward andaway from thesame person.
After separation, theinfant shows behaviors ofattempting to
both approach and withdraw from the parent, avery
disorganized approach to the reconnection.
Sowhen anattachment figure isthesource ofterror, we
become fragmented. This disorganized attachment makes us
178

vulnerable inmany ways. We can have atough time
balancing our emotions, having good relationships with
others, andeven thinking clearly under stress. Even more, a
disorganized attachment makes itlikely that we’ll have a
fragmentation ofthe continuity ofconsciousness, called
“dissociation.” Found inabout 5to15percent ofthegeneral
population even without ahistory ofabuse, andinabout 80
percent ofchildren inhigh-risk families with trauma and
neglect, disorganized attachment and thedissociation that
accompanies itcanbevery challenging toourwell-being.
When wedissociate, wedis-associate different aspects of
ourselves, such asseparating feelings from memories,
thoughts from actions. Wecanfeelunreal andbroken apart.
This isthesource ofafragmented selfthat emerges with a
disorganized model of attachment.
Reactive Attachment
When asecure attachment isnotavailable, wecanexperience
arange ofways that weadapt and dothebest wecan,
including avoidance, ambivalence, and disorganization. But
there areanumber ofsituations inwhich ourattachment may
notbesimply secure orinsecure. Atone extreme ofour
human spectrum ofexperiences isthecomplete absence of
attachment, inwhich there isnoconsistent figure thatwecan
attach to.Inthis case, adysfunctional condition called
reactive attachment may arise andwemay have trouble with
ouremotions andrelationships, establishing rapid connections
with awide array ofindividuals inchildhood, inadolescence,
andintoouradulthood. Reactive attachment canbethought of
asthebest achild candowith theabsence ofanyattachment
figure—not aresponse toforms ofsecurity orinsecurity. This
absence andthe“disorder” that emerges with itaredistinct
179

from thevariety ofinsecure forms ofattachment weare
exploring here. Ifyouknow individuals who’ve experienced
this absence ofattachment, orifyou’ve been through this
yourself, please refer tosome oftheimportant work inthe
professional literature onthis situation ashelpful resources
for healthy growth.
Earning Secure Attachment and Integrating the Brain
When Gail’s son, Steven, was leaving home forcollege after
hiseighteenth birthday, hewas excited tobegin this next
phase ofhislife. Many ofhisfriends were leaving California
fortheEast Coast, buthedecided tostay intheWest and
attend aschool about five hours away from hishome inLos
Angeles. Hismother had gotten illinhislastyear ofhigh
school, andhewanted tobeable toreturn home andseeher
more frequently than across-country college would have
enabled him todo.Hefeltclose tohismother, andlike his
brother andsister, hewas very distressed with herdiagnosis
ofcancer. Hedidhisbest tosupport herduring herradiation
andchemotherapy, butsheinsisted hecontinue togooutwith
hisfriends during thatsenior year andgetready forthisnew
time ofhislife. Itwas Steven’s decision tostay close—but
notthat close. Infact hefeltcompletely supported byhis
mother inhisdecision nottoattend UCLA, awonderful
option for him just a few miles from his family’s home.
Gail hadherself been through alotinherown childhood. Her
mother died when shewasfifteen, andherfather hadbeen an
actively drinking alcoholic during much ofherchildhood.
The death ofGail’s mother “woke herfather up,” and he
began alifeofsobriety after that time andhasstayed sober
ever since. Herfamily seemed togetcloser intheface ofthat
tragedy ofher mother’s passing. For much ofher
180

adolescence, Gail was inturmoil about how shecould leave
hertwo sisters andherfather when itwas time tograduate
from high school. Shedecided togotoacommunity college
near home andhelp outherfather, adecision shewasglad to
make then. Butbefore shegotmarried toSteven’s dad, she
spent alotoftime thinking about how upsetting herfather’s
alcoholism hadbeen inherchildhood. When he’d come home
drunk, hewasterrifying. Hisfitsofrage anddrunken stupors
ledeveryone toscramble forcover— everyone except her
mother, who would take him on.Gail would witness her
father berating hermom, andsometimes physically abusing
her. She didn’t know then butknows now that witnessing
abuse isitself aform ofabuse, aform oftrauma. You might
imagine thatGail’s early attachment experiences with herdad
being filled with terror led her tohave adisorganized
attachment tohim. Hisdrunken states were terrifying. His
berating and beating her mom were terrifying. And her
feeling ofbeing unable toprotect hertwo younger sisters
made her feel terrified and helpless.
During Gail’s later adolescence inherearly twenties, she
decided totrypsychotherapy. This iswhen Ifirst mether.We
worked onherhistory ofinsecure attachments, including a
disorganized attachment model and the accompanying
tendency ofhermind tofragment indissociative states. These
dis-associations ofusually connected processes could come
outwhen she was upset and felt like she was “not put
together” and“unraveling attheseams.” She’d godown the
lowroad frequently with herboyfriend andherfather, yelling
atthem, feeling intense and“overblown” emotional reactions
tosmall things they’d do.Orthese dissociative moments
could emerge andshewould feelblank andahave adifficult
time remembering things orpaying attention. When shewasa
181

teen, forexample, there were times when shecouldn’t seem
tohold ontohermemories ofhermother after shedied, the
loss being overwhelming andherrelationship with herfather
stillterrifying. Wegathered from herattachment assessment
that shehad what iscalled anambivalent history with her
mom, who hadbeen preoccupied about hercompetence asa
mother andawife. Hermom hadbeen warm andcaring, butit
wasarelationship thatGail said was“loving butaconfusing
mess.” Dealing with herfeelings toward thisconfusion was
challenging intheface ofher grief about her mother’s
passing. Insome ways, there were elements ofunresolved
lossaround hermother, too.Reflecting onthatimportant loss
inherlifecould help herresolve that grief and gain more
access to her feelings about their complicated relationship.
Gail generally didpretty well inheremotional andsocial life
astherapy went on,andshewas grateful forthese changes.
Because shehadanambivalent pattern ofinsecurity with her
primary caregiver—her mother—she needed todosome basic
work onsensing her own integrity, clarifying from the
confusion who shewas, what shefelt,andhow shecould hold
ontoherown inner compass intheface ofinteracting with
others. This transformation from her insecure ambivalent
attachment model toward security meant that shecould feel
herfeelings andbalance them well. And thatmeant thatshe
could have mutually rewarding relationships with friends and
romantic partners. Our attachment models contain the
important ways we’ve learned toconnect toothers andknow
ourselves. When wemake sense ofourlives, wecanmove
these models from non-security to security.
When Gail met herhusband, fellinlove, and started her
family inherlate twenties, some ofthepaternally related
182

issues ofdisorganization began toemerge inherlifeandin
their relationship. When they’d have arguments, asmost
couples do,shewould flipoutandfeel terrified. Instead of
standing herground andexpressing herneeds, she’d sink into
ahole thattoherfeltlikequicksand, andasshestruggled to
getoutshe’d dissolve away. This repeating pattern revealed
therigidity ofGail’s being stuck andthechaos ofherfalling
apart that were aspects ofher non-integrated models of
attachment. Some ofthispattern may have been aresult of
herambivalent history andsense ofloss with hermom, and
perhaps afear oflosing herpresent attachment figure, her
husband. Butinthesetting inwhich these experiences arose,
they also seemed tohave elements ofaresponse tobeing
terrified and toberelated tothedissociation from her
disorganized attachment with her dad. Fortunately, these
times ofbecoming fragmented were infrequent, and they
emerged only intheclose connection she had with her
husband. Gail would find herself simply withdrawing from
himinways thatdismissed herown needs forcloseness. This
pattern ofdisconnecting hadthequality ofanavoidant model,
onethatwasclearly apartofherrelationship with herfather.
With friends andherwork colleagues, such disconnection and
such dissociation never occurred. We can seethis asher
avoidant and disorganized models ofattachment being
activated only inthesetting ofherrelationship with her
husband. Such state-dependent activation ofanattachment
model isjust how our human brain works. What was a
problem, though, was that such disconnection and
dissociation made herunable tohave asolid sense ofherself
inconnection with her husband. Whichever models were
being activated, they were preventing herfrom having the
kind ofintegrated relationship inwhich differences could be
183

honored and compassionate connections created that would
make her life more fulfilling and at ease with her husband.
Through making sense ofherpast and working onbeing
present even intheface ofherterrifying feelings—with her
lossofhermom, with hermemories ofherdad, andwith her
fear ofherhusband’s anger when they’d fight—Gail gained
theintegrative ability tosimply hold inawareness whatever
shewas experiencing. She went through thepainful process
ofreflecting onherrelationship with herdrunken father,
about theterror, about hersense ofhelplessness. And inthat
process, shecame tomake sense ofwhat hadbeen non-sense
atthat time inherlife. What thismeant was that shecould
now seetheimpact thatthose terrifying experiences with no
solution hadonheratthattime andhow they’d continued to
affect her now.
Gail would also practice away ofbeing mindful, ofbeing
curious andopen about herown internal experiences without
judgment. Intheface ofafragmented consciousness with
disorganized attachment, itbecame essential thatwework to
integrate consciousness itself. Wedidmany ofthepractices
youcanlearn inthisbook, liketheWheel ofAwareness and
breath practice, which strengthened hermind andintegrated
herbrain. With thisnew sense ofclarity, shecould feelher
own needs forcloseness, herattachment needs, with openness
andacceptance rather than theearlier confusion ordismissal.
With the empowerment ofthese practices, too, her
dissociation became less frequent and less intense and
transformed into herability tosimply beaware ofasense of
“wanting tofallapart” butable toresist thatimpulse. Allof
thisreflective work enabled hertotransform these non-secure
attachment models into one of security.
184

Bythetime Steven wasayoung boy, Gail hadtaken thetime
todevelop what researchers call“earned security.” Wecould
alsocallthis“learned security.” Over theyears since Gail was
initially intherapy, she’d come inforcheck-ins periodically
and I’dhear about Steven’s development. When Gail was
diagnosed with cancer, Ialso saw hertosupport how she
could deal with herfears during thisterrifying time. With her
earned security, shewas inanew integrative position notto
withdraw, become confused, or fragment her mind.
And with thisearned security, over these years shecould also
beasource ofsecure attachment forSteven. Shewas able to
be a soothing safe harbor for him and a solid launching pad.
SoasSteven approached hisown time toleave thenest, he
came tothis adolescent turning point with theintegrative
resilience ofasecure attachment model with hismom.
Research hasshown clearly that nomatter ourchallenging
past, ifwemake sense ofhow ourearly experiences have
shaped usandlearn ournew models ofsecurity, wecanoffer
ourchildren security ofattachment. Steven happened tohave
security with hisdad, too,sohewas feeling solidly ready to
leave home. Hiscloseness with hismother intheface ofher
illness made him feeltheneed tostay close enough tohome
tocome back whenever shemight need him tobethere, but
notsoclose that hedidn’t realize thedeep inner drive to
explore the world that he could now launch into with security.
Reflecting onYour Attachments andMaking Sense ofYour
Life
Whether youareanadolescent oranadult, itisimportant to
make sense ofwhat your early attachment relationships were
like inyour childhood. Given the nature ofmemory
185

development before theageoffive orso,itcanbehard to
recall inanycontinuous way from thisvery early period in
ourlives. This said, even thefaintest impressions canbequite
helpful. And research shows, too, thatasetofquestions that
support your exploration ofwhat you can recall can help
reveal certain patterns thatarehelpful inyour journey togeta
broad sense oftheattachment models youmay have now in
your life. Thefantastic news isthatifyoucanmake sense of
your childhood experiences—especially your relationships
with your parents—you can transform your attachment
models toward security. The reason thisisimportant isthat
your relationships—with friends, with romantic partners, with
present orpossible future offspring—will beprofoundly
enhanced. And you’ll feel better with yourself, too!

ofattachment andthekinds ofresponses they tend toinclude,
andthen we’ll seehow you canunderstand them andmove
them toward security. Remember, you may have many
models ofattachment, oneforeach relationship youhave had
with your caregivers. You may want towrite your responses
186

down inajournal, orsimply reflect onthem inyour own way.
Because youmay stillbeliving with your attachment figures,
your parents orothers, oryou may have moved away from
them, thequestions areboth inthepresent tense andinthe
past tense. Just focus onwhichever one applies toyour
situation now.

Understanding yourself isabasic mindsight tool for
integrating your life. Self-understanding ishow youconnect
your past from memory with your present experience. This is
animportant step inlearning how tohave secure attachment
models inourlives. When wecreate anarrative ofwho we
are, welink past andpresent sowecanbecome theactive
author ofapossible future, too. Soself-understanding helps
uswith “mental time travel” aswecreate acoherent view and
integration of ourselves across the past, present, and future.

How was responding tothese questions foryou? Sometimes
reflecting on these questions can bequite draining.
Sometimes what comes upcanbesurprising, even shocking.
And sometimes youalready know how youwill respond and
it is not a big deal.
Interestingly, researchers who collectively have studied over
ten thousand formal Attachment Interviews featuring
193

questions and topics similar tothose above uncovered
universal patterns. I’llpresent you with thegeneral findings
next soyoucangetafeelforwhat may begoing onwith you.
Please keep inmind, however, asyou read these broad
groupings and their narrative patterns, that the key to
reflecting onthem isnottolump yourself inonecategory or
another, butrather tofind helpful insights into your own life
thatyoucanweave together intoacoherent narrative ofyour
own. Research reveals thatthemore coherent anarrative we
have ofourown attachment issues inchildhood, themore
we’ve made sense ofhow ourearly lifeexperiences have
shaped us,themore likely ourchildren will have asecure
attachment tousand themore rewarding ingeneral our
interpersonal relationships willbe.With ourown coherent life
story, we’ll bemore likely toconsistently provide thefour S’s
ofattachment. And assecurely attached children grow up,
they’ll bemore likely, too,tohave away ofmaking sense of
their lives andcreating acoherent lifenarrative. They’ll have
acoherent sense ofwho they’ve been, ofwho they arenow,
and ofwho they’d like tobecome. And they’ll have a
coherent way ofbeing themselves while also having close,
meaningful relationships with others. That’s what making
sense ofyour lifecanhelp bring intoyour world. That’s what
secure attachment canoffer—whatever ageyouarewhen you
develop that integrated way of making sense of your life.
Our Attachment Narratives and the Two Sides of the Brain
While thedetails ofeach oftheAttachment Interviews
scientists have conducted vary from person toperson, when
looked atasawhole across individuals, patterns emerge.
Attachment Interviews aretape recorded andthen transcribed.
The written document isthen analyzed foritslanguage use
194

andtheways inwhich theinterviewee communicates with the
interviewer (the researcher). Inthis way, the “narrative
analysis” isreally adiscourse analysis thatlooks athow one
person iscommunicating with another. Theinterview findings
reveal that individuals with secure attachment models
generally reflect inacoherent way onthegood andbadparts
ofwhat may have happened during childhood. Wecan’t know
theaccuracy ofthefacts thatarerecalled, ofcourse, butwe
can assess how theresponses fittogether inacoherent
manner—how they make sense, how they areopen and
flexible inreflecting onvarious aspects ofthepast, andhow
they arereflective and inthepresent moment with the
questions and notjust offered asapre-programmed setof
responses.
Even when experiences may have been difficult, oreven
frightening, asecure narrative reveals this quality ofthe
person being present forwhatever comes upintheinterview.
This state ofpresence isthehallmark ofsecure attachment,
both inhow weconnect with others andhow weconnect with
ourown lifestory. Wearepresent, meaning weareopen and
accepting towhatever ishappening asitishappening. And
thispresence inourlifestory, thisattachment security, comes
along with narrative coherence, how we’ve come toterms
with thepositive andnegative ofourearly relationships, and
how we’ve made sense of our lives.
Inothers with avoidant attachment histories, ortheparents of
those with avoidant attachments, the narrative isquite
different. Thehallmark ofthese avoidant narrative reflections
isthat theindividuals insist that they donotrecall anything
about family lifeandthat their family lifedidnotinfluence
how they developed. That isaform ofincoherence inthatif
195

you don’t remember something, how doyou know that this
something didnotaffect you? The adults with thisnarrative
aresaid tohave a“dismissing” state ofmind—they dismiss
theidea thattheir past relationships may have hadanimpact
onwho they are. Inshort, they appear to“avoid” placing
importance ontherelationships intheir lives possibly because
thisisthebest adaptation they could come upwith intheface
ofthe emotional desert that isanavoidant attachment
relationship.
Tounderstand what may begoing oninthepathway from
specific forms ofattachment relationships inchildhood to
corresponding attachment narratives inadolescence and
adulthood, itishelpful toturn tostudies ofthebrain in
creating aworking framework. Inthis view, non-secure
attachment models emerge from non-integrated states ofbrain
functioning. Inmany ways, the communication between
parent and child that does not honor differences and
promote linkage—that is,patterns ofcommunicating in
non-integrated relationships—leads toblocked integration in
thechild’s developing brain. Simply put, thisview suggests
that integrated communication stimulates the growth of
integration inthebrain. Non-integrated communication leads
to non-integrated brain development.
My proposal, drawn from clinical work and scientific
reasoning, suggests thatthere isanunderdevelopment ofthe
right hemisphere ofthebrain inindividuals with avoidant
attachment. Itistheright side that stores autobiographical
memory andholds ourrawemotional needs andfeelings. In
thisway, theavoidant model enables ustonotfeelourneeds,
andwealso don’t recall ourlived experiences offamily life.
That explains notonly thenarrative findings, butalso theway
196

avoidant models shape ourbehavior inrelationships where we
ignore thenon-verbal communication from others, signals
that are both sent and received by the right side of the brain.
Personal reflection inthecortex isaprocess that draws on
autobiographical mappings inthebrain’s cortical region,
dominant ontheright side ofthebrain. Such autobiographical
reflection istheway welook inward tothemeanings and
events ofourlived experience. Interestingly, even ourgut
reactions and heartfelt sensations, signals arising from the
intestines andtheneural circuitry around theheart, arise and
endupprimarily ontheright sideofthebrain, asitistheright
prefrontal cortex that receives such bodily input. These
sources ofknowing aregenerally notexperienced much by
individuals with avoidant attachment.
While both sides ofthebrain usually work together, they do
have differentiated functions. These functions influence not
197

somuch what wedoastheways weperceive theworld and
our ways of being in the world.
The leftside ofthecortex isdominant forlanguage, logic,
linear and literal thinking, and even making lists, like this
one! Notice, too, that inEnglish this isaconvenient and
easy-to-remember listbecause each word starts with anl,as
in“left-sided.” Many studies also suggest that facts are
dominant onthe left side, while our autobiographical
recollections ofepisodes ofexperience are right-side
dominant.
(I’dliketoaskyoutofocus onusing your lefthemisphere’s
skills totake insome ofthese scientific details we’re about to
dive into. The reason todothisisthat when weunderstand
some ofthefascinating andrelevant brain facts inalogical,
linear way, weactually can then use that knowledge to
hyperdrive the ways we can transform our non-secure
attachment models toward security. You’ll need your right
hemisphere’s talents, too, inorder tofully grasp thecontext
and personal meaning ofsome ofthese brain notions. You
canfeelthesense ofwhat we’re about toexplore, andyoucan
track itslogic aswell. Soatthis very moment, we’ll be
calling onboth sides ofyour brain totake inthedetails of
what we’re about toexplore. Inthefollowing three sections,
we’ll usethegistofallthisfoundation toexamine how each
ofthenon-secure attachment models canbetransformed by
focusing the mind tointegrate the brain and your
relationships. Don’t worry about recalling every detail,
they’re allhere andyoucanreview them whenever youwant.
The keyisthatsoon we’ll explore how we’ll apply them in
your own life. Just letthesense ofthese logical connections
198

fillboth sides ofyour brain andgetready forsome continuing
integrative work!)
The right side ofthecortex isnotonly aprimary source of
our autobiographical knowledge; itisalso dominant for
receiving more direct input from thelower subcortical areas
inaddition tothebody asawhole. And yes, you may have
guessed that the right side isoften considered “more
emotional” inthat subcortical and bodily input shape our
emotional lifemore directly andperhaps more spontaneously
androbustly. Theright side ofthecortex maps outthewhole
oftheinterior ofthebody; buttheleftdoes notdothis. This
means that intuition, how wereceive thewisdom ofthe
body’s input from ourmuscles, ourhearts, ourintestines,
likely first influences ourright cortex. The leftside ofthe
cortex has emotion, too, butitmay beexperienced ina
different way, asthatside isnotsopowerfully influenced by
the subcortical regions as the right is.
Soyoucanseehow different thetwosides areinhow they
focus ourattention andhow they enable ustobeintheworld.
They differ in other fundamental ways, too, as we’ll see now.
The leftside ofthebrain hasonefrontal region that when
activated creates an“approach state” thatempowers ustogo
outintheworld andface challenges. Incontrast, theright side
hasareas that create awithdrawal response tonew things.
This approach totheworld goes along with what some
summarize inthisgeneral way: Theleftlooks outward tothe
world, while theright looks inward, intheselfandothers. For
thisreason, itshouldn’t besuch asurprise thattheleftside of
thebrain specializes notonly inlanguage butalso inkeeping
track ofour“social display rules,” theculturally sanctioned
ways wearesupposed tocommunicate with oneanother. In
199

this way, theleftcantrack what others expect and govern
what words are spoken to meet those expectations.
Let’s pause foramoment andjustsense what thismeans for
ourlives. One side, theleft,hasanoutward focus ofwhat itis
concerned about, what itisinterested in,what itenables usto
dointerms ofinteracting with others. What does theright
side help us with in connecting with others?
The right side ofthe cortex also communicates, but it
specializes innon-verbal communication. What isthis? This
includes thefollowing signals, which myleftcortex would
liketolistforyouhere inalogical, linear, literal, linguistic
fashion. Here’s thelist—thank you, left—of theright-sided
dominant non-verbal signals that areboth sent from and
perceived and made sense of by the right side of the brain:
1.Eye contact
2.Facial expressions
3.Tone of voice
4.Posture
5.Gestures and touch
6.Timing of signals
7.Intensity of signals
Inournarratives, theleftside ofthebrain isthought tobethe
drive fortelling ourstory. Buttheautobiographical goods are
ontheright. Soinanutshell, thecoherent narrative of
200

security isreflected intheway that theleftand right are
differentiated well and then linked.
The twosides canwork together, orthey canbefunctioning
somewhat inisolation. When Ifirst read about allthis, I
began towonder how itmight beafoundation for
understanding thedifferent attachment patterns ofbehaving
andoftelling ourlifestory. What was amazing was thatby
understanding thebrain, bytaking onsome ofthese basic
brain facts, you could explain ahuge amount ofthe
research-established psychological and relational findings.
Then you could use that information tocatalyze more
effective interventions tohelp people move toward security. It
wasn’t only helpful tounderstand thedata, itwaseffective in
helping people change.
Recall that the ambivalent attachment model has an
amplification ofattachment needs. How might that relate to
right-left brain findings? Could itbeseen asanoverreliance
ontheright side ofthebrain rather than being balanced with
theleft? When thetwo hemispheres donot work ina
coordinated fashion, onemay become excessively dominant
intheabsence oftheother because thetwosides ofthebrain
balance each other. Inthiscase, thecharacteristic finding of
theambivalent narrative output isaflood ofautobiographical
details that arenotdirectly related tothequestions asked.
This intrusion ofimages andemotions hasthequality ofan
excess ofright-sided activation without thebalancing ofthe
leftside’s role inkeeping track ofthelanguage output. The
leftside isthought tobethesource ofthenarrative drive,
using words inalinear, logical way that explains the
cause-effect relationship among events. But when those
201

events areautobiographical, theleftneeds thecooperation of
theright to tell a coherent story.
With ambivalent attachment narratives, itisasiftheright is
overwhelming theleft’s answering ofthequestions. Inthe
research literature onadults and adolescents, this iscalled
“preoccupied” attachment and aperson issimply assigned
onecategory ofattachment. Butinactual lifewecanhave
many models that shape ournarratives indifferent ways, so
we’ll juststick with thebaseline term of“ambivalent” model
ofattachment topermit ustorealize that wehave many
models across allthecategories ofthebasic childhood
attachment groupings, notjustonemodel. Inother words, we
arenotjustpreoccupied ordismissing; asindividuals, wecan
have ambivalent models and we can have avoidant models.
Okay. Avoidance seems torely ontheleftmode ofbeing in
theworld asaway ofadapting toadisconnected emotional
life. This explains thefindings inthenarrative ofalack of
access toautobiographical memories and aninsistence that
relational matters don’t matter. Ambivalence draws more
heavily ontheright side with aflood offeelings and
memories thatemerge intheattachment narrative, andinlife.
What ifyour attachment model isalsodisorganized? How can
we understand that?
Forthedisorganized model ofattachment weseetimes inthe
disorganized narrative when the responses become
disorganized ordisoriented. This disorientation usually occurs
when addressing thequestions oflossorofthreat. Ifsomeone
hasdied, forexample, theperson may lapse intotalking about
thatperson asifshewere stillalive. Inthecase ofthreat, a
sense ofterror may emerge intheperson’s responses asifhe
were being terrified right then. For example, Imight say
202

about mydrunk father, “Well, hewasn’t really terrifying, no,
Imean, hewould drink, andIguess atthose times hewould
come home and, well, youcansmell thealcohol intheroom,
andhecomes inandIrun, buthe’s toofastandI...”Notice
how thediscourse moves from thepast tense tothepresent
tense andgets disoriented, even disorganized. These features
can besubtle orsevere, butthey reveal anon-integrated
brain’s functioning. Astheleft tries totellthestory, it
becomes disoriented andloses track ofthetopic orthefocus
oftime. Theright side ofthebrain may send elements ofthe
lived past over totheleftinajumbled fashion thatcannot be
easily decoded bytheleft. Asense oftime, mediated bythe
prefrontal cortex thatworks with both leftandright, gets lost
andthepast merges with thepresent. Raw forms ofwhat are
called “implicit memories” may pound myconsciousness
with asense ofmybody and emotions, images, and even
behavioral impulses thatfeelasifthey arehappening inthe
present. These are each the outcomes ofoverwhelming
experiences that may beunresolved inour lives. This
non-integrated state happens when thenarrative focuses on
lossortrauma. Inthese moments, theindividual isfilled with
ablockage across many systems, including leftworking with
right, the linkage oflayers ofmemory, and prefrontal
coordination and balance. The research term forthis is
“unresolved trauma orloss—disorganization,” but we’ll
simply call it a “disorganized” model of attachment.
The great news isthat unresolved trauma orloss can be
resolved through integrating theprocesses ofmemory and
narrative, andtheperson canmove from non-secure tosecure
models ofattachment. Interms oftheleftand right brain,
disorganization may occur when theflood ofbodily sensation
and autobiographical memories oftheright arenoteasily
203

taken inandsorted through bythelinear lefttrying totellits
story with words. Soataminimum, disorganization andthe
unresolved loss ortrauma itreveals can beseen asan
impaired coordination ofthe two hemispheres. With
reflection, wecan transform raw implicit memories into
explicit memories offacts intheleftand autobiographical
memory intheright sothat they donotenter ourminds in
various forms ofintrusive emotions ormemories andinstead
become part ofacoherent narrative ofwho we are.
Ambivalence likewise canbetransformed intosecurity asthe
left and right hemispheres are brought into balance by
developing more ofthelefthemisphere’s roleintheperson’s
inner life. Avoidant models can bemoved tosecurity by
developing more oftheright hemisphere’s role, accessing
those important healthy needs forconnection thathave been
shut down in the past.
Atabaseline level, then, welook tothenotion ofintegration
inthebrain togain insights intohow tomove toward security.
Understanding how the left and right hemispheres each
contribute important butdifferent ways ofbeing andseeing
canhelp guide youinmaking sense ofyour lifeandmoving
toward a more integrated way of living.
Avoidance, Emotional Distance, and theLeft Side ofthe
Brain
Ifyour responses tothereflection questions revealed asense
ofdisconnection from theexperiences with your caregivers,
there may beelements ofavoidance inyour history. Let’s
dive intowhat thatmay have been like, andwhat youcando
about that now.
204

Aparent with whom achild hasanavoidant attachment often
does not perceive—or atleast does not readily respond
to—the non-verbal signals ofdistress, such ascrying orfacial
expressions. There isasense intheinteraction between parent
andchild that theinternal world ofthemind ofthechild is
just notimportant, oratleast notseen. This isalack of
well-developed mindsight and reveals that life for this
parent-child relationship ismore about managing behaviors
rather than empathically feeling another’s feelings.
Ifyour sense isthatyouhadanavoidant attachment, youmay
have hadexperiences inwhich attention was repeatedly paid
tothephysical nature oflifebutnotmuch ofafocus wasput
onthelifeofthemind. Reflect onyour relationship then, or
now, andseeif“mentalese,” ormind language, was orisa
part ofyour relationship. This would beconversations that
lacked words andphrases such as“Iwas feeling ...,”“That
must have feltforyou like...,”“Iwonder what hewas
thinking atthatmoment ...,”“Iimagine thatheviewed this
as...,”“From herpoint ofview itmay have seemed ...,”
and “Her belief doesn’t make sense tome, but Ican
understand why she thinks that way. ...”Each ofthese
phrases reveals anindividual who hasenough mindsight to
communicate either hisorherown internal mental state, orto
take on, and ask about, the internal mental state of another.
Ifyouwere raised bycaregivers who were notonly missing
intheir useofmindsight butsomewhat distant emotionally in
their ways ofbeing with you, itmay bethat mindsight was
not something that these attachment figures helped you
develop. Instudies ofattachment, theteachers ofkids with
avoidant attachment—who didn’t even know the child’s
attachment history—treated them asifthey didn’t need help
205

even when they did.Does thissound familiar inyour life? For
many with avoidant attachment, there seems tobedifficulty
expressing inner needs, orofreaching outtodepend onothers
tomeet those needs. Asoneperson said tome,“Ineeded to
beautonomous from avery young age given how
disconnected mymother was. Why would Iever allow myself
to need help from anyone?”
Ifwedidanattachment interview ontheparent with whom
youhadthisavoidant attachment, we’d bevery likely tofind
anarrative that reveals alack ofaccess toautobiographical
memory andaninsistence thatrelationships arenotimportant
inshaping who they are.Ifthat istheway you’ve come to
make sense ofyour own life, then relationships will notbe
high onyour priority list.Itisn’t thattheparent doesn’t love
thechild, it’sjustthattheadaptation theparent hadtomake
inhisorherown childhood minimized attachment needs then,
andthat adaptation continues now. Ifyou areanadolescent
stillliving with your parents reflecting onthis, please keep in
mind that parents often dowhat they dobecause ofhow
they’ve adapted totheir own childhood experiences. Finding
ways toconnect more fully canhappen, butitjusttakes time,
understanding, patience, andintention. This non-secure model
ofattachment that helped theindividual survive isone of
being disconnected from others. Soifthisisyour relationship,
please don’t measure thisasalack oflove. Itisreally alack
ofskills toconnect. And inmany ways, itisasurvival
mechanism from thepast todisconnect from theneed for
closeness that simply needs to be updated now in the present.
Another partofthisjourney foryouistorealize thatparental
presence may seem inshort supply inavoidant attachment,
thatthesurface ofbehaviors isthefocus ofattention, andthat
206

attuning totheinternal world ofthemind, ofthechild oreven
oftheself, issimply notoften engaged. Inthissetting, you
may have developed with aminimal sense ofyour own mind,
too. The effective strategy tobegin with isforyoutogetin
touch with theside ofyour brain that letsyou focus onthe
internal world—of yourself and ofothers. That istheright
side of the brain.
Since emotions and ourbodily sensations filluswith the
vitality that makes liferich and meaningful, this avoidant
pattern ofrelating from theleftside may have created a
disconnected sense ofselfthatisshort ontheinternal joiede
vivre, that spirit ofbeing alive, that gives lifeitszest. This
lack ofexperiential nurturance leads, Ibelieve, toan
underdevelopment of the right side of the brain.
Sohere’s astrategy. Integration isabout honoring differences
and promoting linkages. Ifyou’ve had ahefty dose of
avoidance, thelefthemisphere may beincharge because it
allowed you todevelop intheface ofanemotional desert.
That was agreat adaptation foryour past. But what about
now? What does that mean for your mental life?
Hold on toyour hat aswe slowly take inthe
science-established notion ofwhat “being intheleft” islike.
When only theleftisactivated anddominant, then ourways
of being tend to be externally focused, logical,
“de-contextualized,” and characterized bywhat iscalled a
“linear way” ofbeing intheworld. “Linear” means onething
following another. “De-contextualized” means missing the
bigpicture into which something fits.Sorather than flowing
with thecontext ofasituation asitemerges, moment by
moment, aleftdominant way ofbeing istoexpect things to
unfold inalinear sequence, inaspecified order, thatcanbe
207

contained, predicted, understood, taken apart and dissected,
analyzed, and, ultimately, logically understood. Ifthatwas a
starting place foryou asachild raised with primarily an
avoidant attachment history, then adolescence might be
particularly challenging with itsfillofbodily, emotionally,
andinterpersonally intense experiences. These components of
life—the body, theemotions, andtheinterpersonal world of
other minds—each have adominant role inright hemisphere
ways ofbeing. Ifyou’ve been given therelationship setting to
develop primarily theleftandnottheright, thiswould bea
great time tobalance yourself anddevelop both sides ofthe
brain well. That’s what integration is all about.
The great news isthatwhatever your age, itisnever toolate
tobring both hemispheres into development and activity.
Take alook atthestory ofStuart earlier inthebook (p.49)
and you’ll find aninety-two-year-old man with avoidant
attachment history who made great strides integrating thetwo
sides ofhisbrain after nearly acentury without it.With an
emotionally andabodily distant mode ofliving, hehadto
learn todevelop hisright side and then link these new
capacities with hiswell-developed left. IfStuart candothis,
it’s very likely you can, too.
Just because parents didn’t offer secure attachment does not
mean you aredoomed tostay with anon-secure model of
attachment. Inthecase ofanavoidant history, ifyoufind that
you have been “leaning totheleft” inyour experience of
avoidant attachment with your caregiver, then theexercises
within thetools sections onmindsight, time-in, andtheWheel
ofAwareness will beuseful inintegrating your twosides so
thatyoucanovercome whatever unbalanced adaptations you
need to.
208

Here aresome basic practices ifyou’ve had ahistory of
avoidant attachment:
1.Practice becoming aware ofyour internal bodily states.
TheWheel ofAwareness rimreview onthesixth sense,
thebodily sensations, canbeavery helpful place to
start. Iffocusing attention onboth limbs atthesame
time isdifficult, trytofirst focus ontheright side and
then on the left.
2.Become aware ofnon-verbal signals. Try watching
television shows with thesound offorforeign language
films without subtitles inalanguage you don’t
understand. These experiences will enable you tolet
your left-sided language centers take abreak andyour
right-sided non-verbal signal perceiving circuits
become more active. Recall that these signals include
eyecontact, facial expressions, tone ofvoice, gestures,
posture, and the timing and intensity of responses.
3.Learn tousenon-verbal expressions. Trylooking ina
mirror ortaking avideo ofyourself andwatching the
recording. Try toexaggerate the sending ofthese
important right-sided signals.
4.Autobiographical memory isalso aspecialty ofthe
right side ofthebrain. Begin bysimply writing down
thedetails ofwhat you did today. Start with the
specifics ofhow yougotoutofbed, what youdidwith
your body asyou got dressed, how you ateyour
breakfast. Seeifyoucansense those experiences asyou
arerecalling them. After these recent memories have
been recounted, try more distant autobiographical
209

reflections, also with details. Don’t worry ifyoucan’t
recall childhood experiences, asthese may bequite
difficult toaccess, and some may not have been
encoded into your memory as well.
5.Emotions arefeltonboth sides ofthebrain, butthey
may bemore direct orspontaneous ontheright. When
you areready, you canfind afriend who canpartner
with you insending and receiving non-verbal
expressions ofdiffering emotions. Tryoutthese basic
nine: joy, excitement, surprise, sadness, fear, anger,
disgust, guilt, andshame. Seealso ifyou cansimply
notice theemotions asthey riseup,even fleetingly. Let
thesensation ofemotion fillyou, and don’t tryto
analyze it or even name it.
6.Context issomething that the right hemisphere
specializes inaswell. Context means reading between
thelines. Itislikethespirit ofthelawrather than the
letter ofthelaw. Itiscontext, rather than text. Context
hasatexture toitthat ismore subtle than theclearly
demarcated definitions of things that the left
hemisphere loves. Some compare thelefthemisphere to
adigital processor, with zeroes andones, andclearly
demarcated definitions such asupversus down, right
versus wrong, inversus out. Incontrast, theright is
analogic, with awide spectrum ofvalues notseparated
intoclearly boxed meanings asontheleftside. Sohere
youaresimply letting yourself getaninitial glimmer of
the meaning behind words and their non-verbal
components. Anexercise youcanperform issimply to

inthetone ofyour voice andthetiming ofthewords.
210

Here aretwoofaninfinite variety ofsentences youcan
tryusing thistechnique: “Iexpected youtocome tomy
party ontime,” or“You always dowhat you sayyou
will do.” Try emphasizing each word inturn with
different tones ofvoice, andseeifyoucansense how
this changes the meaning of the message.
7.Recall thatstudies have shown thateven ifthere isan
outer focus onindependence, there isoften aninner
sense ofneeding closeness that isbeneath awareness.
With this inmind, consider trying totune intoany
inner hints, however subtle, thatyoumay feeladesire
tobecloser topeople inyour life. Being aware that
avoidance was animportant adaptation foryou, go
slow. Reaching outtoanother person toexpress your
feelings inagesture ofwanting more time toconnect
can beanimportant starting place. Since weeach
participate increating ourrelational worlds, you can
have asayinhow toform new kinds ofrelationships in
your life now.
Asyoudevelop amore integrated way ofbeing, youmay find
that things begin tofeel different inside you. Even theway
that you sense how you areconnecting with others may
change asyou find yourself sponging uptheir inner lives
through their non-verbal signals. The presence that emerges
now may seem overwhelming attimes, filled with anenriched
sense ofbeing alive. While this new way ofbeing inthe
world canseem unfamiliar atfirst, seeifyoucanrestatease
with theknowledge that integration brings anew way of
simply experiencing being alive.
In many ways, integration creates more integration.
211

Indevelopment we call this a“recursive” aspect of
something—a reinforcing set ofrecursively influencing
factors that continually reinstate theinitial state ofmind. In
thecase ofinsecure attachment and non-secure attachment
models, wewince and theworld winces back atus,we

security andintegration, wesmile andtheworld smiles back
at us.
Ambivalence, Emotional Confusion, andtheRight Side ofthe
Brain
Your responses tothereflection questions may have revealed
thatyour attachment history involves thepolar opposite ofthe
frozen emotional distance that produces theavoidance of
attachment. Foryou, childhood wasmore likeahotcauldron
ofemotional confusion. Ifavoidance isliving inanemotional
desert, ambivalence canbelikeliving inanemotional fogif
not at times an outright storm.
Ifthisform ofambivalent attachment isinyour history, then
emotional inconsistency and intrusion byyour parents may
have been frequent. Keep inmind that your parents likely
were doing thebest they could, andthatthisway ofbeing is
most helpfully seen astheir adaptations tochallenges intheir
own childhood relationships ortoother aspects oftheir lives.
The leftover issues oftheir own parents (your grandparents)
may have flooded their ability tobepresent andopen ina
clear andreceptive way towhat washappening within you. If
thiswasthecase, itisimportant toknow thatyour own inner
sense of self may be in need of strengthening.
Inmany ways, children canbecome anunintended receptacle
fortheir parents’ flooding emotions. Theconfusion thatarises
212

forthechild isthatatthesame time hefeels heisnotbeing
seen clearly forwho heis,thatheisinsome ways invisible,
heisalso having toabsorb emotions thathave nothing todo
with what heisactually feeling. It’sadouble challenge. And
it’s just plain confusing.
Inresponding totheself-reflection questions, youmay have
found that certain topics brought upasense ofsomething
being raw orunfinished. Inthe formal interview, an
individual with ahistory ofambivalent attachment may seem
preoccupied with certain experiences from the past; for
instance, theleftover emotional issue ofasibling favored bya
parent may feelfresh andquite alive. Itisn’t disorienting asin
unresolved trauma orloss, but itispreoccupying
andupsetting. Asambivalent attachment amplifies attachment
needs, there may beasense offeeling alone orunseen that
remains from childhood and gets experienced often inthe
here andnow inongoing relationships asasense ofanxiety
anduncertainty. There may beafeeling thatone’s needs may
never bemet, andthatifthey aremet, they canvanish inan
instant. That’s theamped-up attachment system thatfinds no
relief, nosecurity, with theambivalent model. There isno
reliable internal sense that things will work out in
relationships.
Aswetake ourattachment models with uswhen wemove out
into theworld andrecursively reinforce thevery models we
used toadapt toour earliest relationships, our learned
adaptations evoke from the world similar patterns of
interaction that we’ve grown upwith. Studies reveal,
forexample, that ifwe’ve had ambivalent attachment at
home, ourteachers likely perceive usaslesscompetent than
wemight really be,offering help when wemay nothave
213

needed itand, inturn, stifling ourindependence. What we’ve
acquired athome wecarry forward outintotheworld. This is
how thesynaptic changes inthebrain that developed in
childhood asadaptations andmodels ofattachment canpersist
and perpetuate inadolescence and adulthood, revealing
themselves asaspecific environment (like school oranew
romantic relationship) evokes our unfulfilled attachment
needs.
Ifyou have experience with this self-reinforcing cycle of
ambivalent attachment, itisimportant that you gain an
understanding ofhow your brain works sothat you can
explore new ways ofseeing and experiencing your
relationships and your life in general.
Ifyou often find yourself flooded byyour own emotions
without left-sided balance, youmay have been struck byyour
emotional state when you were responding tothereflection
questions. Research findings show that individuals with the
ambivalent attachment model often respond toattachment
interview questions byappearing tofeel“intruded upon” by
thenarrative reflections they inspire. This canbeexplained on
thelevel ofbrain science bytheadditional finding thatthese
individuals display what could beseen asaright-sided excess
without thecalming effect oftheleft. The leftportion of
thebrain cannot sort through the bombardments from
theexcessively active right hemisphere, and asaresult,
images, feelings, bodily sensations, andfragments ofunsorted
autobiographical recollections may inhibit theleft’s attempt
toprovide some kind oflinear, language-based, logical telling
of their personal narrative. The right hemisphere’s
autobiographical memory ofyour mother favoring your
sibling intrudes onyour left’s keeping track ofthequestion at
214

hand, your body fills with tension, and your
emotions influence theclarity andcoherence ofwhat yousay.
Beyond thescope oftheresearch laboratory, what thismeans
inreallifeisthatindividuals with theambivalent attachment
model often feel overwhelmed byinterpersonal interactions
that they experience as“flooding” or“stressful.” Fear and
anger mingle with the need for security and comfort.
Here aresome simple practices ifyou’ve had ahistory of
ambivalent attachment:
1.Cultivate theability toname your internal emotional
states. “Name ittotame it”isastarting place for
building your left hemisphere’s important language
abilities and linking them tothe more raw and
spontaneous emotions oftheright sideofthebrain. You
cansimply describe what you feel; you don’t need to
explain it.
2.Journal writing canbeanincredibly valuable activity
foryou. Using your lefthemisphere’s drive totella
linear, logical, language-based story will build this
important narrative skill. Narrating your life can
become animportant integrative tool tobuild the
connections between your two hemispheres.
3.Practice the Wheel of Awareness. Integrating
consciousness will enable youtostrengthen thehubof
your mind. Itisinthisstrengthened hubthatyoumay
find themental space inwhich tosort through your
sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts before you
choose toexpress them toothers. This ishow youcan
215

useyour lefthemisphere toactively participate inthe
SIFTing of your internal mindscape.
4.Know your emotions. For many, knowing that
feelings are not facts helps tosort through the
sometimes intense and rapid internal emotional world
that may arise, especially intheface ofrelationship
challenges. Feeling rejected, forexample, canactivate
thesame neural circuitry intheright side ofthebrain
thatrepresents bodily pain. Knowing this, youcanuse
your “Name ittotame it”skills toacknowledge the
pain ofafeeling ofdisconnection andrecognize thatit
may feeloverwhelming butactually isnot—in fact, itis
something you can learn to reflect upon and calm.
5.Asyou develop theability touseyour growing left
hemisphere towork closely with your right, seehow
youcanconnect with others inclose relationships ina
more satisfying way forallofyou. Keep inthefront of
your mind whatever feelings arise, knowing that
feelings areindeed notfacts. You may attimes have
sensitivity toothers’ signals that makes their feelings
enter you more fully andflood your sense ofbeing a
differentiated individual. There may beother moments
when aninternal sensation inyoumakes youfeelthat
youcan’t rely onothers. While these may beaccurate
assessments, they may also beclouded by an
attachment system on“overdrive,” based onvigilance
forconnection inorder tobesafe. Working onthe
mindsight practices inthefirst twotools sections ofthis
book may help bring aninternal state ofcalm asyou
focus onobserving these patterns ofemotional response
with others.
216

6.Attachment canfeel like alife-or-death matter. When
wearevery small, werely onourparents orother
caregivers foreverything—for food, forwater, for
protection. Ifwewere cared forbyunpredictable
caretakers, wemay still feel, asadolescents oradults,
incredibly frightened andunprotected when something
stressful happens inourlives. Theincreased attachment
needs ofthisform ofambivalent attachment canfeel,
literally, likeamatter oflifeordeath. Knowing thiscan
greatly help you toname thissensation, seeitforthe
attachment-based emotional reactive state itis,andthen
not take itsopersonally asyou acknowledge the
emotion without allowing it to swallow you up.
7.Strengthen your internal observer. Developing apartof
your mind that canobserve, witness, andnarrate your
experiences canbeapowerful way to“own” what you
are going through within relationships. When you
realize thatyour past experiences may have been foggy
orstormy notbecause ofsomething “wrong” with you,
but simply areflection ofthekinds ofemotional
communications with your caregivers, then youcansee
how such emotional weather patterns now may simply
beechoes from thepast. Having your observing mind
narrate how this isallunfolding can give you the
emotional space tocalm your internal state and see
what ishappening inyour ongoing relationships with
more clarity.
You cangrow theintegrative circuits ofthebrain throughout
life. Asyoumove through thisprocess ofdeveloping greater
integration, you may find that your newfound sense of
balance andequilibrium, even intheface ofstresses thatused
217

tomake youfeelconfused, canbecome akind ofsafe harbor
foryou. Aswell, your growing inner security canbecome a
solid launching padfrom which youcandraw strength asyou
interact with others and explore the world.
Disorganized Attachment and a Dissociating Brain
Asabaseline, wehave oneorsome combination ofthethree
“organized” attachment models including security with its
integrative functioning, avoidance with itsoveremphasis on
left-sided functioning and theminimization ofattachment
needs, andambivalence with itsright-sided development and
themaximization ofattachment needs. For some ofus,
terrifying experiences with our caregivers can result in
disorganized attachment and thetendency tofragment our
minds indissociation. Justasinourchildhood these terrifying
experiences could find noresolution and we have a
disorganized model, so,too, inthepresent moment our
behaviors andlanguage output canbecome disorganized. In
thenarrative responses, we’ve seen that when disorientation
occurs, itreveals astate ofunresolved trauma orloss. Ifthisis
part ofyour experience, there ishelp ahead. Fortunately, the
challenges of dissociating, balancing your emotions,
maintaining clear thinking intheface ofstress, andhaving
mutually rewarding relationships, which areeach apartofthe
disorganized model, can be healed.
Theresearch isquite clear. When wemake sense ofevents in
ourlives thatmade nosense, themind canbecome coherent,
ourrelationships more fulfilling, andourbrains function ina
more integrated manner. That’s the movement from
disorganized attachment with itsunresolved states to
resolution and security.
218

One way tothink about unresolved trauma orlossisthis. The
brain first embeds experience inthose implicit layers of
memory that form thefoundation ofhow weremember
things. These building blocks include our emotions, our
perceptions, ourbodily sensations, andeven ourbehavioral
responses. We summarize these foundations asschema or
mental models that help usgetready torespond tofuture
events in a process called “priming.”
Under normal conditions, these building blocks ofimplicit
memory become integrated by alimbic region, the
hippocampus, into thetwoforms ofexplicit memory offacts
and autobiographical recollections. Dominant ontheleft,
factual memory letsusknow that something happened even
though wemay notknow when orhave thefeeling ofbeing in
thatexperience. Autobiographical memory isdominant onthe
right andhasthequalities ofasense ofselfatsome point in
time in the past.
I’ve proposed thatoneaspect ofdissociation andunresolved
trauma orlossisthatthemovement from implicit memory to
explicit isblocked. When this blockage occurs, implicit
memory initspure, un-integrated state has theimportant
characteristic ofnotbeing labeled ascoming from some time
inthepast. Sowhen aperson with disorganized attachment
and unresolved trauma orloss istrying torespond to
questions about those experiences, therawimplicit memories
areretrieved and theindividual isflooded with sensations,
emotions, images, orbehavioral impulses thatfeelasifthey
arehappening now. There isnosense thatthese areimages or
feelings from thepast. That iswhat unresolved trauma orloss
can create, and itfeels intrusive, confusing, and even
terrifying. Sometimes itmay feellike afull-on flashback of
219

theevent without asense that itisfrom thepast, butmore
often itmay simply beanintense image oremotion, bodily
sensation, orimpulse. These areeach part ofwhat cancause
disorientation during thenarrative responses. Simply living
life, too, can recall elements ofthose times ofloss or
trauma—like someone getting mad atyou asyour parent
perhaps used to—and that trigger evokes notonly these
intense implicit emotions and sensations, but also that
fragmentation of your own inner experience, or dissociation.
Knowing about these processes ofimplicit and explicit
memory, ofunresolved trauma andloss, andofdisorganized
attachment anddissociation canbeanessential starting place
ontheroad tohealing. Since these forms ofnon-integrated
memory canbeinfact integrated, thebrain canmove from
unresolved states toresolution and healing. Here aresome
suggestions ofsteps you may consider inhelping yourself
transform disorganized attachment toward security.
220

Following aresome simple practices todevelop greater
security and resolution ifyou have had ahistory of
disorganized attachment in your life:
1.Keep ajournal andbesure towrite about times when
your internal world may have feltitwas fragmenting.
What were thetriggers thatpreceded such dissociation?
How did you first know you were beginning to
“unravel”? What enabled youtogofrom thisstate into
amore integrated return toyour usual functioning? The
journal entries will beofgreat value asyoureflect on
what the common triggers were across different
episodes in your life.
2.Knowing that disorganized attachment isamodel that
you may have had inresponse toterrifying and
disorienting experience oftrauma orlossinyour life, it
can bequite helpful toreview those attachment
questions thatevoked particularly strong reactions from
you intheprocess ofreflection. Returning tothose
questions anddiving more deeply intoyour present and
past responses canilluminate which areas may beleft
unresolved. SIFT your mind forsensations, images,
feelings, and thoughts that may arise asyou ask
yourself about any times you felt terrified inyour
childhood, any times you feltrejected orabandoned,
andanylosses youexperienced. Focusing onthebreath
forafewminutes canhelp youasyouexplore these in
your experiences.
3.RAIN heals thepain: Psychologists Tara Brach and
Jack Kornfield useawonderful acronym about being
open toourinternal experience thatcanhelp inbringing
221

unresolved issues toresolution. We recognize the
trauma orloss, accept thatithasoccurred andmay be
inastate ofnotbeing resolved, investigate thenature of
theexperience inourpast andpresent lives, andhave
non-identification with theexperiences, meaning that
wedon’t letthose events define ouridentity. Bringing a
RAIN approach tothose internal sensations, images,
feelings, andthoughts thatreveal unresolved trauma or
grief isahelpful stance totake inhealing your mind
andmoving toward resolution andintegration inyour
life.
4.InSIFTing through your internal experience, there
may betimes when you feel that you are getting
overwhelmed andaremoving toward chaotic states of
flooding ofemotions orimages, orshutting down ina
rigid state ofdisconnection. Various approaches may be
helpful atthese times when youmove outofthemore
flexible flow ofintegration. InPart I’sMindsight
Practice F,weexplored how putting onehand onyour
chest andanother onyour abdomen canbesoothing for
many. You canalso tryaresearch-established approach
ofputting ahand oneach shoulder, lefttoright, then
right toleft, andthen alternately tapping each shoulder
inwhat iscalled a“butterfly hug,” used effectively in
helping those who have experienced thetrauma of
natural disasters. Another science-proven strategy that
might beofhelp isthetime-in with thebreath practice
(Part II’sMindsight Practice A),which canalso help
bring calm toyour mind asyou explore distressful
memories of the past.
222

5.Ifyou find that particular areas inyour explorations
continue to be terrifying, sometimes seeking
professional support can behelpful tomove from
unresolved toresolved trauma andloss. Think ofitthis
way: Alossortrauma canbelikeasplinter inyour foot
during ahike. Once there, itbecomes difficult towalk
andthesplinter becomes more irritated. Thelonger you
trytosimply ignore thesituation and adjust tothe
splinter, themore youmay limp along thetrail. Taking
thetime toremove thesplinter, either byyourself ifyou
canreach it,orwith someone’s assistance ifitisoutof
your reach, cangreatly help your journey. Sometimes a
trauma orlossissimply notsoeasy toreach with your
own reflections. Having asupportive professional help
you remove that unresolved splinter canempower you
to begin the healing process.
6.Ifyouarestillliving with orinteracting with someone
with whom youfeelyouhave unresolved issues, when
youfeelstrong andclear inside yourself, itcanbevery
healing togotothat person and attempt tomake a
repair. Please keep inmind that theother person may
notbeinthesame state ofmind tomake areconnection
with you, andbeing rebuffed because ofthismay lead
toeven more painful rejection oranger. Nevertheless,
simply knowing that repair canbequite healing, just
imagine that thismay someday bepossible when you
andtheother person arefeeling able tocarry outsuch a
reconnecting and healing process.
7.Whether ornottheother person isable tocommunicate
with you about these issues ofterror and loss, the
growth really begins andends with your own internal
223

work. Ifyou find that implicit memories ofpast
experiences ofloss ortrauma stillintrude onyour life,
youcanwork onyour journal writing, inconversations
with close andtrusted friends, orwith atherapist tohelp
bring these unresolved issues toward resolution. Iwill
share with you thisknowledge from working over the
last thirty years with people who have lacked
resolution: Healing ispossible nomatter what happened
toyou. Though allforms ofinsecure attachment may be
accompanied byasense ofshame, thatpainful feeling
that there issomething wrong with you, please know
thatshame isanemotion thatcanarise especially with
being disconnected and terrified. We allheal in
different ways andinourown time, butbeginning the
process byseeing what happened and acknowledging
how ithasinfluenced your life, including anysenses of
shame that might bepresent, isahuge andimportant
starting place onthejourney tointegrate your lifeand
create therelationships with yourself and others that
will befulfilling andfurther support your healing and
growth!
8.Disorganized attachment anditsunresolved trauma and
loss, like theother non-secure models ofattachment,
canbetransformed through your relationships andyour
reflections. Ifyou areaparent and have had the
opportunity toreflect onhow such experiences inyour
own pastmay have ledtosome terrifying behaviors that
frightened your offspring, itisnever toolatetomake a
repair. Begin with your own internal work, and then
move tomake areconnection with your teen orolder
adolescent. I’ve even worked with adult children whose
parents have had thecourage toreconnect with them
224

after decades following such disconnecting experiences.
Sooner isbetter than later, butmaking themove when
youareready toacknowledge what hashappened and
bring theissue intothedialogue with your offspring can
beacrucial step toward healing foreveryone involved
inwhat isoften across-generational passage of
disorganized attachment. You canendthatlegacy now
with your own reflections and reflective conversations.
Creating a Safe Harbor and Launching Pad for Adolescents
Themind isshaped bychanges inourrelationships andinour
brains throughout thelifespan. Asadolescence involves so
much exploration and change—of different interests,
compatibilities andtypes ofrelationships—it isanextremely
vital andformative time oflife. Ifweaddtothese changes
andchallenges theattachment models thatarenon-secure, we
can see how what could have been just rocky waters
sometimes turns into overwhelming tempests.
Working ontheimpact ofattachment during theadolescent
period, forboth adolescent andadult, isessential. Navigating
the shifting needs for attunement and attachment as
adolescence unfolds, riding the changing tides ofthe
relationships between parent and adolescent and peer with
peer canbeatricky challenge. Ideally, theadult willhave the
presence ofmind tocreate themental space sothatheorshe
cancontinue toserve asasecure home base, arefuge inthe
storm thatcanbelife,sothattheadolescent knows thatasafe
harbor always exists. Itisessential forboth theadult and
adolescent to“always keep thechannels ofcommunication
open”—a statement that can apply asmuch toyour
relationship with others asitdoes toyour relationship with
yourself.
225

AsIwatched myeighteen-year-old daughter getting ready to
leave forcollege, Ifelttheechoes ofmyown childhood—the
attachment models Iformed based onthemanner inwhich I
wasraised andhow these models have evolved asIstrove to
become asecure attachment figure formysonanddaughter.
Letting thetransitions unfold asmychildren gotolder has
somehow required thatIcare forayounger part ofme,that
collection ofstates ofmind ofallthevarious attachment
models Ihave hadfrom myown youth, sothatIcanfeelclear
inhaving her,ourlastchild, leave home. The mind works to
help usassimilate themany brain states, ourstates ofmind,
thatwehave developed invarious ways andatvarious stages
aswegrow andgothrough life. The challenge istofind a
way toconnect with those brain states andtake care oftheir
various needs. That’s aform of“state integration,” which isa
healthy part ofliving. And right now, Ineed todifferentiate
thatyounger state ofmind, thatyounger me,andweave that
inner aspect ofmyself more fully into mylife, toprepare to
nolonger bethefather with achild athome, andyetcontinue
tocare for my own inner needs for nurturance and
connection.
Ihave hadtotake themeanings ofparenting from theinside
outontwo levels. Ihave had tomake sense ofmyown
childhood soIcanprovide thekinds ofconnections needed to
create secure attachments formychildren. And Ihave hadto
parent myself from theinside out, meaning Ihave had to
acknowledge that ayounger part ofmewith states ofmind
thatneeded tobeseen, safe, soothed, andsecure inmyown
childhood isstillalive andwell inside me.Taking care ofthe
needs ofthatpart ofmecame naturally while caring formy

wehave theopportunity toboth receive thatcare inouryouth
and toreceive and give that care aswemove through
adolescence and adulthood.
Watching ouradolescents getready toleave home brings up
allthese issues ofnurturance and care, ofattachment and

MINDSIGHT TOOLS #3
Time-Between and Reflective Conversation
Inthis entry we’ll befocusing onthereflective skill of
mapping theinner worlds ofothers and thenature ofour
communications with one another. Such atuning into
another’s feelings, thoughts, memories, beliefs, attitudes, and
intentions will enable others to“feel felt” byyou. And this
feeling, thissense ofjoining, which Icall“time-between” is
thekeystarting place tomake close relationships work well.
Aswealso focus onhow wearecommunicating, weare
attending tothequality ofconnection wehave with other
people and making it possible to improve our relationships.
Foradolescents, theselfisnaturally changing alotasthey
encounter and become adept atnavigating more and more
differing facets oflife. Finding astrong inner sense ofwho
you areinyour connection with others isoneofthemajor
goals forthistime oflife.This isperhaps why friendship isso
incredibly important toadolescents: Itbecomes ameans for
self-awareness and self-invention.
Relationships inwhich youfeelfeltbyanother person—when
yousense thatyour internal world, your mind, istaken inby
another andrespected—are thebuilding blocks ofhealth. You
may find thatsome ofyour connections with your friends feel
thisway andarewonderful inyour life. You may find other
relationships arerarely likethat, orworse, they make youfeel
bad about who you are.
When wereflect ontheinner life ofothers, when we
participate inreflective conversations and attune toanother
person’s mind beneath behaviors, wejoinwith others andour
228

sense ofselfisexpanded. Life feels full. Apositive sense of
love andcaring emerges between us,andwithin us.Feeling
feltisthefundamental experience ofasecure relationship,
whether itisbetween friends, romantic partners, teachers and
students, orparents and their offspring, older adolescents
included. Itisreflection thatenables ustocreate thatcrucial
feeling-felt experience in our lives.
Aprimary way wecanconnect with others inanintegrative
way canbecalled a“reflective conversation” or“reflective
dialogue.” Much ofwhat happens inschools, andeven inthe
busy lives ofmany modern families, does not offer an
opportunity forsuch important conversations. Whether you
areanadolescent oranadult, having these reflective skills in
your life’s toolkitisagreat addition. Let’s first examine how
thepatterns ofrelating toourattachment figures from early
on may have shaped how we connect with others now.
Making Sense of How Our Models Shape Our Present
Our attachment experiences with ourown parents create a
starting place where welearn thefirst lessons onhow tobe
with ourown emotions, how toreflect onourinner life, and
how tohave reflective conversations with others. Inmany
ways, these attachment relationships shape the initial
direction ofhow we’ll sailoutonourjourneys. With these
earlier lessons having shaped thedeeper parts ofthebrain,
ouremotional circuitry, wesetourcourse asadolescents into
thewider world. Reflecting onthose relationships canfreeus,
atwhatever age, tomake thelifewechoose rather than livea
life that has been chosen for us.
Itmakes sense foryou asanadult andasanadolescent to
make sense ofyour lifehistory soyoucanbeasfully present
229

aspossible inyour relationships. What this means is
reflecting onyour relationships inthepastinyour own family
lifeand asking yourself how those experiences influenced
your development. How you’ve come tounderstand who you
areandhow yougottobethatway isimportant notonly for
your own well-being butforhow thewell-being ofyour
relationships with others, including with your own children,
present or future, will unfold in your life.
For someone with anavoidant model ofattachment,
depending upon others may make himorherfeellikeaweak
person. This model creates aninner stance ofisolated
thinking, ofbeing analytical without feeling very much. Ifthe
adults around ushave been ignoring ourinner life—if they
don’t show interest orkindness forwhat wearegoing
through—it canbevery painful andeven induce afeeling of
shame. Aswith each oftheattachment models, shame may
arise when wedon’t have connections toourcaregivers ina
reliable way. While shame canshut down ourfreedom to
connect, wecanmove past that, knowing thatitmay simply
be an emotional response to misconnections in the past.
Inmany ways, reflecting onourown journey gives usa
chance todothings differently with our own children.
Without these important reflective conversations, people can
simply feel alone and disconnected. Emotions canserve as
ourcompass onlife’s journey—letting usknow when toturn
and, ultimately, where togo.Whether they flood usinthe
moment ofinteracting with anadolescent home from school
forthe holidays and moping about, orflood usasan
adolescent trying togetourparents toagree toanadventure
weareeager toembark upon, these internal measures ofwhat
hasmeaning cancome from places wemay noteven beaware
230

of.Sometimes wehave major blocks toknowing what these
emotions are.Ifwe’ve used anadaptation toblock feelings, as
about one-fifth ofthepopulation does with anavoidant
history, ithasabigimpact onhow wecanknow ourown
internal worlds—and the worlds of others.
Forothers with ahistory ofambivalent attachment, we’ve
seen thattheflood offeelings from thelower regions ofthe
nervous system moving upinto the non-verbal right
hemisphere cancreate asense ofbeing overwhelmed. Ifthis
isyour history, we’ve seen that reflecting onyour past and
building thebalance ofthelefthemisphere’s more distant,
analytical approach toweaving your lifestory can bean
important and life-changing strategy. The amplified
attachment system with anambivalent history canattimes
make interacting with others filled with intense anxiety about
how reliable thispresent connection will be.Taking thetime
toreflect onthismodel andhow itisanadaptation from your
own intrusive orinconsistent past relationships canhelp give
you the internal ballast toengage openly inreflective
conversations now.
Having ahistory ofdisorganized attachment experiences in
which you may have felt terrified ofyour attachment
figure may have leftyou with atendency todissociate—to
dis-associate your usually fluid flow ofthoughts, feelings, and
memories asyou interact with others and reflect inwardly
within yourself. Bepatient with yourself. Dissociation isa
developmental outcome ofbeing terrified, anditcanitself be
terrifying. Journal writing, reflection, andbeing open about
what ishappening internally canallbehelpful starting places

thatthebrain continues tochange across thelifespan andthat
231

healing relationships ofallsorts, including theoneyouhave
with yourself, cansupport thegrowth ofnew integration can
help give youasense ofstrength, hope, anddirection. Ifyou
need time tosimply collect yourself when things getintense,
find away torequest that with amutual understanding that
this issimply what you need while engaging inreflective
conversation.
Inavoidance, wecan’t just block outone kind offeeling:
When weshut offafeeling, weusually shut offallour
feelings. And with ambivalence and being flooded by
feelings, wealso become unable toconnect with others and
befully present with them aswell. Ifwehave atendency to
fragment inresponse tointense interactions, todissociate with
ahistory ofdisorganized attachment, then learning how to
befriend ourown internal emotional world isanimportant
starting place forbeing open tothefeelings ofothers. Clearly,
each ofthese non-secure attachment models hasemotions at
itscore. And emotion itself isaprocess thathappens notonly
within us,butalso between and among us.Sodon’t be
surprised ifhaving anon-secure attachment model, ormodels,
makes reflective conversations challenging. That’s okay! The
key iskindness and patience. Reflecting onfeelings in
ourselves guides ourdecisions andeven letsusknow what
things mean inourlives. Reflecting onfeelings with others
helps ustojoin minds, toconnect with others indeeply
meaningful ways.
The questions forself-reflection inPart IIIwill bean
important review infinding away toenhance your
time-between skills. How wehave learned torelate toour
own emotional lifeisacrucial starting place tohaving deep
understanding and the possibility for growth.
232

MINDSIGHT PRACTICE A:Reflecting onHow Your
Attachment Models Shape Your Reflective Conversations
Forthispractice, let’s return tothemindsight questions on
your attachment experiences from Part III(see pp.163–167).
Consider theattachment model ormodels that you have
experienced inyour life,bethey secure, avoidant, ambivalent,
ordisorganized. You may have hadmostly one, orsome ofall
four. Whatever your setofattachment models, Iinvite you
now toconsider how those attachment experiences and the
models you developed inresponse shape how you now
connect with others. How have these attachment models
influenced your ability tobepresent foryourself orothers?
How dothese models influence your skills ofattuning toyour
own inner world—or theinner worlds ofothers? Doyouhave
theexperience offeeling felt? Doyoufeelconnected toothers
in a way that supports the feeling of trust emerging?
These reflections canbeanimportant exercise toheighten
your awareness ofthecontribution you may bemaking to
thequality ofcommunication with others. I’llinvite you to
now consider that you have theknowledge toplay amore
vital roleinyour relationships than perhaps youhaduptothis
point. Remember, your attachment models may shape how
youconnect andcommunicate with others, butthese models
arechangeable! Sothegreat news isthat with your new
self-awareness, you can develop thetools tohave more
fulfilling ways of connecting with others, and with yourself.
Reflection, Integration, and the Origins of Empathy
Time-in promotes internal integration. And time-between
catalyzes interpersonal integration. Aswe’ve seen, oneofthe
major experiences during adolescence isthat the brain
233

becomes more integrated. The key isthat while such
integrative changes seem todevelop intheir own time andwe
may notbeable toalter this timing much, wecaninfact
stimulate thebrain asitisundergoing these genetically
programmed and experientially shaped changes toactually
grow inmore richly integrative ways! Asimilar process is
possible in terms of interpersonal integration.
What happens inafamily, with friends, atschool, andeven in
theculture ofourcommunities andlarger society canshape
the way the brain develops.
Buthow doyoucreate more integration inyour relationships
with others?
By now you know one important strategy: reflection.
Reflection may notchange thetiming ofintegrative growth,
but it can change the depth and richness of that growth.
And thegreat thing isthat, aswith internal integration,
whether youareateen orinyour nineties, these time-between
practices reinforce integration inyour relationships nomatter
what your age.
When you take time-in, you arereflecting onyour inner
mental life. That means you sense and areaware ofthe
sensations ofthebody, you feel your feelings, think your
thoughts, remember your memories. Whatever arises inyour
subjective experience, youletitenter awareness andsimply
bepresent asitemerges. That’s inner reflection. When you
didthetime-in practices ofbreath awareness andtheWheel
ofAwareness earlier, yougotafeeling ofhow focusing the
mind on its internal subjective experiences can feel.
234

Now we’ll explore how wecanreflect ontheinner world of
others, and onour connections with them. One ofthe
principal means forcreating time-between isengaging ina
reflective dialogue orconversation that focuses ontheinner
experience ofeveryone inthecommunication. Inreflective
conversations each person canshare what they arefeeling,
thinking, remembering, hoping, dreaming, believing, or
perceiving. These conversations connect ustooneanother so
thatwecanfeelfeltandseen—so thatwecanfeelauthentic
andreal. Reflective conversations make lifemeaningful and
enable ustofeelapart ofsomething larger than ourisolated
sense of self.
Isthere anything off-limits inareflective conversation? I
believe thatanything from theinner worlds ofthepeople in
conversation brought outinarespectful andkind way isfair
game. Why respectful and kind? Respect entails that we
honor differences between ourselves andothers. And respect
means thatwedonotpush people who aredifferent from us
away butinstead work topromote linkage despite differences.
With kindness we honor and support one another’s
235

vulnerabilities, creating asafe space where wecanopen upin
anauthentic way. Showing respect foroneanother andbeing
kind aretwo essential ingredients ineffective reflective
conversations.
Another important aspect ofreflective conversation isthatwe
observe patterns inhow we are communicating and
connecting with one another. Studies ofthebrain clearly
show thatreflection, inward orincommunication with others,
stimulates theactivation and development oftheprefrontal
cortex toward itsintegrative growth. When westudy the
mechanisms atwork forsuch inner self-knowing awareness
andother-directed awareness, wefind that what isactivated
are the integrative prefrontal regions and related areas,
including themirror neuron system thatletussponge upthe
feelings ofothers inside ourselves andenable ustoresonate
with someone else.
When weattune toanother person andallow ourown internal
sensations tobeshaped bythat other person’s feelings, we
create “resonance.” When weresonate with someone, we
come tofeel their feelings atthesame time aswebecome
more aware ofourown. This awareness includes ourbodily
sensations aswell asourown emotions. Webecome more
self-aware. When wetune intotheinner lifeofanother, we
can create compassionate communication, one filled with
empathy and caring. This connection istheessence ofa
healthy, supportive relationship filled with mutual respect,
kindness, andcompassion. Reflective conversations make it
possible to join with others from the inside out.
Learning tobemore reflective canhelp anyone, regardless of
age, develop amore integrated brain. Foradolescents going
through these important years when thebrain isinfluenced by
236

experience tolaythefoundations ofintegration, working on
these skills can beespecially beneficial. Learning how to
relate toothers inmeaningful ways using time-between
reflective conversations canhelp adolescents become more
resilient tolife’s changes andchallenges—and resilient isa
good thing tobecome asearly oninlifeaspossible! Soletus
now explore amindsight practice that canhelp adolescents
and adults alike develop the skills tobereflective
conversationalists and mindsight mavens.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE B: Reflective Conversations
Think ofaperson inyour lifewho youfeelbrings outthebest
inyou. Lettheway youtwointeract fillyour awareness. Now
think ofanother person who brings outtheworst inyou.
Reflect onthenature ofyour communication with thatperson.
And now compare thetwopatterns youhave ineach ofthese
relationships. How doreflective conversations play arole, or
notplay arole, ineach relationship? How has honoring
differences and cultivating connections been apart—or not
been apart—of your relationship with each ofthese two
people in your life.
Inthefirst part ofthispractice, reach outtotheperson who
brings outthebest inyou. Seeifyoucanfind some time to
simply express tothem your gratitude foryour relationship.
You canSIFT your mind andletthisperson know how you
feel and what your connection means foryou. Let the
positive sense ofconnection just fillyou bytaking time to
soak inthissense ofcloseness. Being grateful isapowerful
source ofreinforcing thepositive experiences wehave inlife.
Sharing thatgratitude with another person isapowerful way
of amplifying the positive interpersonal connection.
237

Now imagine how youmight trytoimprove therelationship
with theperson who brings outtheworst inyou. What would
you dodifferently? How might you communicate with this
person inaway that would bemore inline with reflective
conversation andintegration? Doyouthink youcould tryto
initiate such anew approach toyour relationship? Foryour
first goatthis, trypicking someone with whom you’ve
perhaps hadalong-standing relationship, onethatinthepast
may have been filled with trust butrecently hashad some
change thatneeds anattempt atcourse correction. Itmight be
amisunderstanding oramissed opportunity toconnect. Keep
inmind thatsometimes reaching outcanbehard. Butwhile
making achange inhow you communicate canbehelpful,
sometimes itjust doesn’t work well. Sobeprepared by
embracing theuncertainty inherent inany relationship: We
justdon’t know exactly how another person may respond. But
time-between gives youafocus ontheprocess, andthatisan
important place tobegin. Consider writing down some ofthe
thoughts that occur toyou before and after you dothis
exercise. And remember, youcanalways choose how tobein
your relationships with others. It’snever toolate tomake
improvements.
The PART We Play in Creating Ourselves in Relationships
Weallhave arole, orpart, weplay increating thequality of
ourinterpersonal relationships. Here’s anacronym that can
help usremember theessential role orpart weplay in
cultivating healthy relationships with others. PART means
thatwearepresent, attune, resonate, andcreate trust. This is
thePART weplay inhelping create themost balanced mental
life for ourselves and the others with whom we are
connecting.
238

Our mental lives will thrive ifwetake thisPART weplay
seriously. This doesn’t mean inaheavy-handed way but
playfully and with intention! When adolescents aretreated
with thisrespectful PART weplay asadults, they aregiven an
invitation toenable their own minds tothrive. And when
adults are treated byusadolescents with presence and
attunement, when weareopen toresonating with what is
being communicated bytheadults inourlives, then trust can
be created across the generations. It is a two-way experience.
Being aPART ofothers’ lives may notcome easily atfirst if
thiswasnotapartofyour own early lifeexperience. Notonly
does learning tobepresent inthisway help relationships with
others; recent studies show that being present improves our
own physiological health, too. This may sound more like
science fiction than science fact, butcarefully conducted
research reveals thatifwecanbepresent forourexperience,
ifwecanbeaware ofwhat ishappening asitishappening,
then we’ll improve oursubjective sense ofwell-being and
enhance theway our immune system functions and even
make ourcells live longer! Learning tobepresent reduces
stress andeven reduces theeffects ofaging onthose caps at
theends ofourchromosomes, ourtelomeres. Another aspect
ofthese studies amazingly finds that learning tobepresent
makes usnotonly healthier buthappier. Our cells will thank
us as we learn to be more present in life!
Sothisisawin-win situation. Notonly will ourbodies and
minds beinbetter shape with presence, butthisway ofbeing
open and reflective toothers inthePART weplay in
communicating will also make our relationships thrive as
well. Body, mind, and relationships are enhanced with
239

presence—that’s thewin-win nature oflearning tobepresent
in life.
Reflection is the key to creating presence and connection.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE C: Repairing Ruptures
Ifyouhave anargument with afriend orfamily member, it
canbeextremely helpful toreflect onwhat happened andthen
make anattempt tomake arepair. Inthispractice, reflect on
your ongoing relationships and think ofone inwhich a
rupture hasrecently occurred. Itmay besubtle orintense, but
thisdisconnection between youandtheother person may be
inneed ofrepair. Letmewalk youthrough some basic ideas
about repair, andIinvite youthen toreach outtothisperson
to engage in a reflective conversation to reconnect.
When yourepair arupture inarelationship, itmeans making
amove toward theperson andreconnecting with them. Ifyou
have anopen rupture with friends orfamily members, think
ofways youmight goback andreconnect with them. Before
youshare your own experience, seeifyoucanimagine away
toexplore their experience. One effective way tobegin isby
making astatement about your interest inconnecting again;
this can break the ice and set things in motion.
Sometimes asparents wedothings thatcreate arupture inour
otherwise close connection with ourchild oradolescent. Itis
ourduty toreflect onsuch ruptures andmake theeffort to
repair and reconnect after we’ve apologized for our
contribution totheconflict. Another lesson isthatsometimes
wedothings thatwedon’t really want todo.Thebrain hasits
higher, prefrontal part that helps usbeaware ofthings. But
sometimes thelower limbic, brainstem, and bodily areas
directly influence our behaviors without the intervening
240

prefrontal filtering orcalming influences. Wecanflipourlids
andgodown thelow road. IntheLow Road section inmy
book Parenting from theInside Out,Idiscuss theimportance
ofrupture andrepair with regard toyounger kids. Letmesay
thatbeing reflective isessential torepair ruptures with those
wecare about atany age. Infact, during adolescence,
because there can besomany challenges, itshould bea
central theme tomaintain open lines ofcommunication,
especially when theinevitable ruptures inthat connection
occur.
Looking upon ruptures asanopportunity toconnect again and
not just aburden oraproblem inlife can help us
approach these challenging moments asoccasions tocreate
integration when integration isbroken. Iknow with myown
twoadolescents, doing sohasallowed ourconnections tostay
really strong. And ithas also taught them through our
interactions todevelop mindsight intheir own lives. Having
thepower ofreflective conversation gives usabasic tool, an
essential way toconnect around things thatreally matter, that
makes theway werelate toone another have adeep and
authentic quality to it.
241

A Tuning In
Sohere’s theidea. When you areready, you cancheck in
with theother person andseeifthisisagood time tospeak
with him orherabout what isgoing on.You canstate that
you’d like toreconnect andwhen it’stime, you canfind a
quiet place toengage inareflective dialogue. Listen towhat
isbeing said, don’t judge. Being open totheother person is
essential tolettheperson feel felt and foryou totruly
understand what might begoing on.One ofthehardest
elements may betoletgoofthenotion thatyouareright, and
theother person iswrong. Listen, take intheother person’s
perspective, andrealize that understanding each other isthe
road toreconnection. When it’stime, you can share ina
non-judgmental way your own experience, using “I”language
like“Ifeltthat...”or“Ithought that...”rather than “You
made mefeel...”or“You didn’t do...”Letting each person
inthedialogue have space toexpress andbeheard fully is
essential.
Though repair isnoteasy—and further rupturing can feel
painful—it isworth trying. Be sure you are inthat
receptive hub ofyour mind before you start, soyou canbe
open towhatever arises intheconversation. There areno
rights andwrongs inrepair, simply asharing ofeach person’s
experience.
242

PART IV
Staying Present Through Changes and Challenges
Inthisfourth part wewill explore various ways that asan
adolescent orasanadult wecanstay open andaccepting to
thechanges andchallenges ofadolescence. This period oflife
isfilled with new ways ofseeing theworld, interacting with
others, experiencing thebody, making decisions, andtaking
responsibility. Allofthese changes mean itcanbeachallenge
foradolescents tomaintain internal balance. And asadults
supporting adolescents, such changes may challenge ustobe
open towhat ishappening, tobereceptive and responsive
instead of reactive, to connect rather than correct.
IfIhadtosummarize inoneword alloftheresearch onwhat
kind ofparenting helps create thebest conditions forachild’s
and adolescent’s growth and development, itwould bethe
term “presence.” As we’ve discussed throughout our
conversation together, being present means being open to
what is.Presence involves being aware ofwhat ishappening
asitishappening, being receptive toourown inner mental
sea, andattuning totheinner lifeofanother person. Being
present forothers means weresonate with what isgoing onin
their inner worlds, creating theessential way wefeel their
feelings. This feeling feltsensation isattheheart ofhow we
can help one another feel seen, safe, soothed, and secure.
Feeling feltisthebasis forsecure attachment. Itisalso the
essence of healthy relationships in all domains of our lives.
Sooften wewant tohelp thepeople welove fixtheir
problems. Wewant toshow them how tosolve adilemma,
resolve aconflict, orgetridofpainful emotions. Butinorder
togive them what they need most ofall,which istomake
243

them feelfeltandconnected with us,weneed tonotdothese
well-intended things first andinstead simply bepresent for
ourloved one. Ifwecanstay attuned tothisperson andallow
theSIFTing that emerges toenter us,wecantruly resonate
with what thisother person issharing about their experience.
This isthepart thatmay bethemost challenging, especially
foradolescents and parents who areexperiencing different
feelings about allthechanges that areoccurring inthe
adolescent’s life and perhaps not seeing eye toeye.
Resonance requires that weletsomeone’s internal feelings
enter usandchange us.If,forexample, thefeeling thatarises
issomething wecannot handle, then we’ll automatically,
without conscious intent, shut down theattunement process.
IfIamunable tobeopen toasense ofexcitement about my
daughter’s plan togoonanadventure andtravel toanother
country with friends, itbecomes quite difficult formeto
simply take inherfeelings about herplan andsense what is
happening inherworld inthat moment. Inanattempt to
problem-solve about how shemight avoid anydanger inher
travels, Imight failtosimply bepresent toherexperience
and, insodoing, miss agreat opportunity toconnect.
Understanding does notmean going along with every idea or
plan; itmeans starting with connection and then exploring
together what might bethesteps shecould take toremain safe
on her journey to see the world.
The problem with putting upsuch initial blockades to
presence isthattrust between adolescent andadult willlikely
bedamaged. Presence, attunement, and resonance, onthe
other hand, create trust. Remember ourmindsight tools on
time-between (see pp.201–216)? This isthePART weplay
inhelpful communication. PART means thatwearepresent,
attune, resonate, and create trust.
244

Inany close relationship, connection means becoming a
PART of the communication in that moment.
Honoring the Person an Adolescent Is Becoming
Asparents wecannot control thepeople ouradolescents are
becoming. Asadolescents, wecantrytobeopen tothemany
internal andinterpersonal experiences thatemerge inourlives
asourteens andearly twenties unfold. This adolescent period
isbydefinition oneofintense change, andthepotential for
intense challenge—for adolescent and adult—is great. The
keyforboth generations istobeopen towhat isunfolding, to
honor theperson anadolescent isbecoming through allofthe
many unpredictable stages and experiences this time entails.
Honoring means being present forwhat ishappening and
being open andaccepting sothat wecanplay animportant
PART inouradolescent’s life. And honoring our own
changes asanadolescent means, too, thatwecanbepresent
forwhat ishappening asithappens. Icannot control mylife,
butIcanbepresent foritinmyteens andtwenties sothatI
can best support my own emerging development.
245

Inmany ways, theessence ofadolescence canserve asour
guide toknowing how thisbecoming process isworking. The
emotional spark ofadolescence means that thefeelings that
arise willbeintense andsometimes challenging, forourselves
and forothers. While this passion can fuel afull life,
sometimes wide swings inemotions canbeexhausting and
make lifedifficult. Social engagement means that ourpeers
246

play asometimes crucial role inhow wefeel and how we
make decisions. Depending on who our friends are,
sometimes those influences may begood for us, and
sometimes they may notbeinour best interest. Novelty
seeking isawonderful part ofouradolescent journey, filling
uswith new experiences thatareenriching andchallenge our
learning. Butfocusing inononepassion, having discipline to
stick with difficult projects likelearning amusical instrument,
aforeign language, asport, oranacademic subject, can
require singular focus ofattention that may bechallenging.
Embracing this tension and realizing theneed forfocused
efforts ispart ofthe“work” ofadolescence inaddition to
taking onnew experiences. Finally, ourcreative explorations
that arefueled bynew ways ofseeing lifecanoften bean
exhilarating journey into exciting new ways ofapproaching
theworld. Not every exploration iseasy tounderstand or
accept, butforadolescent and adult alike, focusing onthis
internal drive forcreativity can beanimportant way of
staying present on the journey itself.
Inthesections thatfollow, we’ll explore anumber ofspecific
changes and challenges that confront usthrough the
adolescent period, such asromance, sex, drug useandabuse,
andtheexperiences ofleaving thefamily andreturning home.
Naturally there areanendless number ofchallenges thatcan
arise during adolescence, such asdealing with divorce, the
demands ofschool, thedistractions ofanincreasingly “online,
allthetime” world, and finding employment. The selected
examples we’ll explore here offer usanopportunity tobuild
onourearlier conversations andmindsight tools toilluminate
how staying present forwhatever arises, asanadolescent or
anadult, isthe essential foundation forahealthy and
productive journey through adolescence nomatter what issues
247

weareexperiencing. What follows arestories blended with
science thatoffer usideas andfacts about how tostay present
andmaintain anopen relationship aswemove through these
important times.
Leaving Home
Ifirst metSara when shewastwelve. Shecame infortherapy
todiscuss heranxiety about being atanew school and
making new friends. Sheended upmaking thetransition well
butcame back totherapy several years later asasenior in
high school because shewas anxious about starting college
across thecountry. She was excited tostudy biology ata
challenging school butwas nervous about being faraway
from herparents. She would bethefirst toleave home,
leaving twobrothers back with herparents, who were happy
shehadfound apassion inherlife. Intherapy thistime Sara
learned todosome basic time-in practices, such asbreath
awareness and the reflective exercise ofthe Wheel of
Awareness (see pp.131–136). With some practice shesoon
wasable tocalm heranxiety: Shemade space inhermind to
hold inawareness whatever feelings arose and then just to
accept them forwhat they were. Sheused theacronym RAIN
toremind herself torecognize, accept, investigate, and not
identify with heranxiety when defining who shewas. From a
Wheel ofAwareness point ofview, shecame tosense her
anxiety assimply apoint ontherim, afeeling shecould be
aware ofbutwas notcompletely immersed in.Shewas able
tocenter herself inthenow more spacious andstrong hubof
hermind. These time-in practices strengthened hermind and
empowered hertoapproach this moment ofleaving home
with more ease and enthusiasm.
248

When wemove from thecomfort and familiarity ofour
family home outinto theunknown ofthewider world, itis
quite natural foranxiety toemerge. When themind tries to
predict what willhappen next and everything isnew and
unfamiliar, itisnatural tofeel nervous and uncertain.
However, depending onhow one responds tothese natural
feelings, either they can move tothebackground and be
stabilized orthey can take center stage and beamplified,
absorbing usinthe intensity offeeling worried and
concerned.
Ironically, when wefight what wefeel, thefeeling gets
bigger, notsmaller. When Sara came infortherapy, shewas
understandably inthemidst oftrying nottofeelanxious. But
thateffort only intensified heranxiety. Acceptance ofwhat is,
being present forlifeasitemerges, moment bymoment, is
thekey tomindfulness and theessence ofpresence. With
such mindful practice onthebreath and immersion inthe
Wheel ofAwareness exercise, Sara learned totransform her
anxiety into a sense of openness to what was.
249

During thistime attheclose ofherlastyear inhigh school,
wealso explored what herrelationships with friends and
family were like. Shewas close toherparents, andfeltthat
they supported herandunderstood who shewasforthemost
part. Though hermother never went tocollege, andherfather,
anaccountant, was notinterested inscience and initially
thought sheshould gointo business, both herparents were
open tohergetting acollege education inbiology ifthatwas
what shewanted. With heryounger brothers, oneafreshman
inhigh school and theother just beginning middle school,
Sara feltannoyed attimes, butmostly shefeltclose tothem,
and even proud and protective ofthem when they weren’t
“invading” her life with their joking around.
Sara had aclose social support network, with anextended
group ofclassmates shewould hang outwith ontheweekends
and with afew very close friends sheconsidered herbest
friends. Sara had dated alotinherlasttwo years ofhigh
school buthadnoongoing intimate relationship, noromantic
interests, during her senior year.
Nothing stuck outinSara’s history tomake meworry about
amajor psychiatric illness like depression orananxiety
disorder. Weallhave atemperament, which means theinnate
predisposition ofournervous system toreact incertain ways.
Temperament includes our sensitivity toinput from the
environment, theintensity with which wereact toinner or
outer stimuli—like our own feelings from the inside or
sounds orsights from the outside world. These inborn
characteristics also include thequalities ofhaving agenerally
positive attitude toward lifeandwhether weenjoy orreact
negatively tochange and novelty. One way todescribe
personality isthatwecanhave ageneral tendency toactivate
250

one ofthree major emotional states ofdistress: fear and
anticipatory anxiety, sadness and separation distress, and
anger and rage. For much ofSara’s life, shedescribed a
tendency tolean toward fear andanticipatory anxiety when
she felt stressed, rather than to the other two modes.
Wecould see,especially after Sara’s parents came inwith her
forafew sessions, that herreactions toleaving home for
school likely were related tohertemperament, nottoher
specific attachment toherparents. Attachment, aswe’ve seen
inPart III,ishow achild connects with parents, aform of
relationship that shapes usinmany ways. According toher
parents, Sara was “always,” foraslong asthey could
remember, aperson who hadanintense reaction totheworld,
especially toward changes inherroutine, butshealso hada
generally positive demeanor. She was anupbeat child and
now seemed to be the same way as an adolescent.
Sara wasvery sensitive tothings, meaning thatsmall amounts
ofinput (sounds, sights, smells) would getasignificant
response from her, andthatresponse would bebig. Another
temperament characteristic was that Sara generally didnot
likenew things. Perhaps likeisnottheright word. Sara hada
big,negative, automatic reaction tonovelty andchange such
thatnew things seemed toevoke afeeling ofanxiety andfear
atfirst. After awhile, when shecould figure outwhat was
happening, she’d warm upanddive intothenew activity with
some reserve butultimately with gusto. Some would callSara
“shy,” andthat would beafairterm; others might prefer to
use the phrase “slow to warm up.”
Weallhave atemperament, aninborn propensity ofhow we
respond. And this was simply Sara’s way ofbeing inthe
world. With adolescence, the changes that emerge may
251

intensify some ofthose earlier characteristics from our
childhood asweface thechallenges thatarise. Butformany
ofus,infact forthemajority, ourchildhood temperament
does notpredict how we’ll beinourteenage years orbeyond.
It’safascinating issue, butrealizing that wechange and
evolve based onourexperiences aswell asourtemperaments
is important as we create the life we want to have.
Attachment experiences andtemperament interact toform our
personality. And personality iswhat isbeing shaped during
ourchildhood andadolescence. Ifweareopen asadults, we
can even create changes in who we are throughout our lives.
While attachment isbased onour interactions with our
caregivers andisnotrelated inasignificant way toourgenes,
temperament isinborn andisrelated toourgenetic factors or
other issues unrelated toexperience. Forthemajority ofus,
theexternally observable features ofourtemperament, when
notintheextreme, infactdonotpredict how webecome later
on.For about 80percent ofchildren, their temperamental
characteristics areinthe“middle range” ofvalues, and
experience plays alarger role inshaping their paths. For20
percent, 10oneither end ofaspectrum oftypical
temperamental characteristics, the extremes of their
temperament seem tobeassociated with thepersistence of
nervous system tendencies such assensitivity oraversion to
novelty. Experience plays arole inthedevelopment ofthese
individuals aswell, buttheunfolding ofpersonality forthis
20percent isshaped inagreater way bythepropensities of
the nervous system based on inborn temperament.
For Sara, ifhernervous system had anintense degree of
reactivity, sensitivity, and withdrawal from novelty (she is
slow towarm up), then herinternal experience would be
252

intense asshewent through life. Fortunately, herattachments
appeared tobesecure asachild, soherability toregulate her
own internal state—her emotions and reactivity—would be
optimized because those integrated relationships would have
cultivated integration inSara’s brain. And integration isthe
basis forflexible regulation. That’s what attachment does:
Our parents provide thescaffolding when they attune tous
with their presence, which shapes how welearn tocalm our
own reactivity andsoothe ourown distress andbalance our
own emotions. Interactive attunement inattachment leads to
internal regulation.
SoSara hadstarted lifewith thesecure relational world to
optimize herself-regulation. That’s agreat start. Butshealso
had atemperament attheextreme, suggesting that these
propensities toward fear andanxiety might persist andmight
intensify asshe approached the adolescent challenge of
leaving home.
Sara didnotseem tohave adisorder ofhermood, her
thinking, orherbodily image and eating. She also didnot
have theclinical presentation ofsomeone with ananxiety
disorder, such aspanic orobsessive-compulsive disorder.
Like themajority ofadolescents, Sara was experiencing the
common challenges ofmoving from childhood toadulthood
butdidnothave aformal psychiatric disorder. She was
experiencing the challenges ofadolescence, not the
emergence ofadisorder inneed ofspecific treatment
interventions such as medications or intensive psychotherapy.
Butifyouhave aninborn proclivity tobereactive, sensitive,
and novelty-distressed, then even with ahistory ofsecure
attachment, life will continue tobe distressful and
challenging. You may nothave aformal disorder, butyou
253

may beexperiencing significant andrealdistress. Sousing the
mindsight tools (intheform ofmindfulness ofthebreath and
theWheel ofAwareness practices) tohelp herlearn for
herself how tocalm herinnate nervous system reactions
worked well for Sara, and off to school she went.
Thelesson forSara wasthateven ifyouhave atemperament
that isinborn, aparticular personality propensity you are
living with, youcanstilluseways tostrengthen your mind to
improve your life. Rather than trying toignore herinternal
experience, Sara could learn tobepresent with her
propensities so that she could become more resilient in life.
Now here wewere inherfirst year ofcollege. Sheloved her
classes. She loved being atthedorm even ifthefirst few
weeks were filled with theunavoidable feelings ofloneliness
andhomesickness. Sara hadlearned tocreate aspace inher
mind, thestrengthened hub ofherWheel ofAwareness, to
reflect onherfeelings sothatshedidnotletherfeelings take
over, sothatshewas notlostonherrim. Shecould give her
emotions thespace toarise, fillherawareness, andthen just
float away as other feelings came up.
Remember that after ninety seconds anunimpeded emotion
will begin totransform onitsown. Itisoften how wefret
over afeeling that creates suffering and maintains the
intensity andduration ofthatfeeling inourlives. Fretting can
involve attempting toavoid afeeling and itcan mean
vigilantly clinging tothat feeling outoffear. Fretting can
involve ussaying, “Ishould not feel that feeling—go
away!”but thefeeling justgets stronger. And fretting canalso
involve arapid shutting down ofbeing aware ofafeeling
even though theemotion remains beneath ourconsciousness.
Just giving space toafeeling without fretting about itletsus
254

make it“mentionable andmanageable,” asFred Rogers used
to say. Mister Rogers was so right.
AsSara learned toname herinternal state ofworry asa
natural human concern about newness and uncertainty, she
could simply bepresent forthis initially uncomfortable
feeling and then letitlessen inintensity sothat shecould
move ontoliveherlife.That’s thepower ofpresence tobring
freedom and vitality to how we live.
Puberty, Sexuality, and Identity
When Sara first came inasasixth-grader and just turning
twelve, shehad entered puberty. Puberty ismarked bythe
development ofthebody anditschanges insecondary sexual
characteristics (growing genitals andlarger muscles inboys;
widening hips and budding breasts ingirls). This sexual
maturation anatomically isassociated with increases in
chemicals thataredistributed throughout thebody, hormones
ofvarious sorts thathelp regulate growth andactivation ofthe
sexual regions ofthebody. Changes inthebrain itself may
notcorrelate directly with thetiming ofthese changes inthe
body, sowecan’t state that mental changes necessarily go
along with these sexual changes. But the increase in
circulating sex hormones following theonset ofpuberty
creates new andintense sexual drives, feelings ofattraction,
and erotic arousal.
This increase inpubertal sexuality inthesetting ofsometimes
later brain maturation with delayed impulse inhibition and
other executive cognitive functions becomes animportant
issue inmodern times. Many studies suggest thatadolescents’
sexual maturation used tobemuch later, inthelater teen
years, sixteen orseventeen. Inearlier cultures adolescents
255

becoming sexually mature atthatagewould then bevery near
thetime when they’d become notonly sexually active but
domestically ready tosettle down toraise afamily. Fora
variety ofreasons, including nutritional intake, children are
sexually maturing atearlier ages, especially girls—sometimes
before hitting their double digits—but their brains arenot
maturing atthis same rate. Sara was typical ofthis trend,
entering puberty before she was a teenager.
Ontopofthis earlier onset ofpuberty inmodern culture,
establishing anindependent home lifeand reaching sexual
maturation associated with bearing children willnotgenerally
occur foranother decade ortwoafter puberty. That isalong
transition period tobesexually mature but domestically
non-responsible, aduration that hasnever existed, asfaras
wecan tell, inour human history. This isthemodern
experience ofasubstantially longer adolescent period oftime
between childhood and adulthood.
Tounderstand thechanges ofsexuality andromance andthe
challenges they present toboth adolescent andadult, weneed
toexplore how these physiological factors influence both our
internal experiences and ourrelationships during this time.
Being present forthese issues asthey arise isgreatly aided by
understanding what ishappening inthebody andinoursocial
worlds. Brain changes arerarely demonstrated directly tothe
visible eye, butparents andteachers cantellwhen themind’s
capacity forabstract thinking begins during this period of
early adolescence. Asteens, webegin toseetheworld with
conceptual patterns beyond theconcrete facts we’ve been
learning throughout elementary school. Aswe’ve discussed,
such abstract reasoning andthinking include seeing ourselves
andothers from abitofadistance, seeing general patterns
256

about lifesetoutinstories within novels and films, and
beginning towrestle with issues about lifeanddeath andthe
meaning and purpose ofwhy wearehere onEarth. The
notion ofpersonal identity—who weareand what really
matters tous—will begin tobecome acentral theme inour
inner thoughts, inourjournal writing, inourconversations
with friends, and in our academic work.
Atthisage, too,adolescents begin toactinvery distinct ways
with different groups ofpeople. They may have one
“persona” orway ofbeing with fellow teammates insoccer
club, another with friends from school, and another with
siblings orwith parents. During thisearly adolescent period,
studies show, there isoften little awareness ofthese distinct
“ways ofbeing” or“states ofmind” that candominate and
distress teen and adult alike. Itcanseem that people have
many divided states thatthey arenoteven aware ofhaving. I
know formyself, asafourteen-year-old, when Imoved past
thisearly adolescent time into mid-adolescence, IfeltasifI
were split up,asifIhadmany personalities thatseemed tobe
activated indifferent ways depending onwhom Iwas with.
Those shifts were confusing atbest. Who was Ireally ifI
could be feeling and acting in such different ways?
Inaddition tothese experiences ofchanging identity andits
various manifestations internally and interpersonally, the
impact ofincreased levels ofsexual hormones inboth boys
andgirls hasaneffect onanadolescent’s overall physiology
and neurological functioning such that feelings ofsexual
attraction andarousal begin toarise within awareness. Now
wedevelop asexual self, anew identity filled with novel and
powerful sensations. Some ofthese feelings may have been
present earlier inlife, butthey were usually lessintense, less
257

persistent, and less available toconscious reflection during
those years. Formany reasons, then, adolescence ismarked
by an increased awareness of sexual sensations.
For some individuals, this new awareness isexciting; for
some, feeling sexually aroused ingeneral orattracted toone
person inparticular may feelvery uncomfortable and“out of
control”; forothers, awareness ofthese new sensations canbe
outright terrifying.
Sara didnotshare with memuch ofherinner experience of
attraction tosome oftheboys atschool, perhaps because Iam
amale therapist. Shewould mention them tomeinpassing,
andthen move ontoother issues, often about herfinding new
girlfriends atschool. Bythetime shefeltacclimated toher
new middle school experience, she was ready to stop therapy.
Foranyadolescent, thenew sensations ofromantic interest
and sexual arousal can beuncomfortable. When they first
arise, their newness and their intensity can beconfusing.
These feelings can bepowerful and exciting but also
overwhelming. And when sexual feelings intensify, they can
feel like just toomuch tohandle. Given Sara’s extreme of
temperament toward sensitivity andnovelty, wecanimagine
that these new feelings might beespecially overwhelming.
Feeling outofcontrol, feeling helpless, feeling thatsomething
is“taking over” areallnatural responses tothehormonal and
neurological alterations that emerge during this period.
Let’s think about this forany ofusasadolescents: We’ve
gone from anintense interest intheworld around us—people,
activities—to anew state ofhuge feelings inside us.That
change alone isamajor shift intheorigin ofboth thequantity
ofsensations andthespecific quality ofthem. Now addtothis
258

thereality that these emotional sensations aredoing exactly
what emotions do,they aregetting usto“evoke motion,”
e-motion. They create astate ofmind inwhich ourwhole
system, ourbrain andwhole body, isbeing readied totake
action. And theaction thatsexual feelings prime ustotake is
tomove toward thepersons towhom weareattracted and
connect with them. That’s adrive, animpulse, adeep
motivation. Itfills ourawareness automatically, itactivates
ourbehaviors automatically, and itcolors theway wefeel
automatically.
When theemotional state isattraction, thedrive istoconnect.
Talking tothat person isastart. Getting toknow them,
holding their hand, kissing them, fondling them, engaging
with them sexually, having intercourse areallsometimes
hidden (and sometimes notsohidden) desires andimages of
what may unfold. The kinds ofimages anddegrees ofdrive
vary from person toperson, dependent upon individual
differences, maturation level, access toemotional states
within consciousness, social settings, and culturally
sanctioned norms ofbehavior. Sexual attraction captures our
imagination too,weaving thecontent ofourattraction intothe
daydream-like quality offantasies. Sexual drives, sexual
fantasies, sexual behaviors, these areallapart ofwhat we
mean when wesaythatfollowing puberty asadolescents we
experience thematuration ofour sexuality. We become
sexual beings.
Emotions drive ustomove, totake action, tosatisfy aneed,
andadolescence isfilled with these new emotions thatdrive
ustofulfill these new needs. It’s alotofnew feelings,
images, andimpulses. And ifcultural practices inhibit those
internal sensations from being expressed asactions, there may
259

bealotofgestures without engagement. But incultures
where engaging insexual behaviors ispermitted, oreven
encouraged asinthemodern cultural practice of“hooking
up,” such sexual activities may befrequent. Our biological
legacy istomove from sexual immaturity during the
pre-adolescent years tosexual maturity intheadolescent and
adult years. How weexperience and express those sexual
feelings will beshaped byourtemperament, ourfamily, our
friends, and our culture.
Let’s remember, too,thatinourevolutionary past, there wasa
much quicker transition that bridged thedivide between
sexual immaturity and adult responsibility. Bythe time
physiological sexual maturity happened inthemiddle tolate
teens, wewere socially setuptomake sexual connections
with others and ready to make babies.
Now wehave aprolonged period ofadolescence inwhich
sexual feelings emerge with maturation butpair bonding
(finding amate andcreating anew family home) does not
occur until much, much later. Inmodern cultures today, these
informal sexual connections sometimes shape how an
adolescent first realizes his or her sexual life.
Hooking Up
Thelasttwoyears ofhigh school forSara hadbeen filled with
learning about her sexuality byexperimenting through
“hooking up”with boys atparties andafter school incasual
encounters thatfeltgood toherbody buthard onhermind.
Sara would find herself wanting more from these boys, at
least most ofthem, andwould then feelrejected when aboy
shehadhooked upwith would notreach outtospend more
time with herinthedays andweeks after or,sometimes, even
260

completely ignore herwhen they crossed paths atschool. In
some settings, there isanimplied ifnotoutright stated rule
that two people hooking upshould infact notgetinvolved
with each other emotionally. That canwork forsome people
butnotothers. And when thatdoesn’t work outforonly one
member of a pair, it can be painful for either or both of them.
Ifyou areinyour adolescence now, you may feel asocial
pressure tohook up,asifitisanexpected way ofbehaving in
social settings. Butremember, times arealways changing, and
your parents may remember feeling quite theopposite societal
pressures: thatcasual sexwas unacceptable ortaboo. Even if
theadults inyour lifedon’t seem to“get” what you’re going
through, keep inmind thatgetting sexually involved outside
thecontext ofatrusting relationship can have significant
challenges. Sex without commitment canfeel less rich, and
even ifneither party islooking foralasting relationship, it
canlessen thedeep, intimate connection thatisacomponent
of any sexual encounter.
Aswe’ll explore inthenext section onromance, there are
three major ways wecanconnect with others indeep ways.
One isasfriends inanattachment-based connection where we
feelclose andconnected, receiving andgiving care, creating a
sense ofsecurity through seeing theinner lifeofafriend and
soothing them when they aredistressed. Another issimply
being erotically aroused and feeling physically attracted to
someone. And athird way ofconnecting isthrough romance,
feelings ofbeing “inlove” andwanting tobearound aperson
as much as we can.
One challenge ofhooking upisthatsometimes there canbe
animbalance inwhat each person expects. Iftwo people
simply want thesexual activity, assuming thatpregnancy and
261

diseases arebeing prevented, then itcanbestraightforward.
The fact that sexwithout commitment canlessen thedeep,
intimate connection issomething toconsider, forsure, as
we’ll discuss inthenext section. Sometimes, however, the
falling-in-love circuits become active only inoneperson and
then it’spainful forboth. Ifthisishappening with afriend,
then thefriendship may become injeopardy because oneof
youwants more ofacommitment than theother. Then even
the friendship may not be able to survive.
During hersenior year, Sara’s parents were more concerned
about thepossibility ofhergetting pregnant orcontracting a
sexually transmitted disease than Sara becoming frustrated in
herromantic interests. AsforSara, even though shewas
nervous about herfuture ofleaving home, shewould get
swept upinhersexual feelings ofattraction forboys andlose
her concerns and sometimes her caution.
The culture inwhich Sara was growing upmade these
informal sexual liaisons anexpected part ofherteen life.
From kissing andfondling tooralsexandsexual intercourse,
over herjunior andsenior year Sara learned alotabout being
erotically involved with boys butnotmuch about romance or
long-term relationships. Shewould learn ofthese things later.
Many ofherfriends hadboyfriends, butshesaid itwas “a
little ridiculous” because those same boys would behooking
upwith other girls atparties allthetime. That wasabetrayal
Sara saidshedidnotwant toexperience inherlife,soshehad
no interest in such a “fake” setup.
ForSara, there were times when herhooking upatparties was
enjoyable forher; atother times shefeltitwas simply her
“duty” tobeapart ofherclique atschool andaway tofeel
attractive. While shemostly enjoyed hersexual experiences,
262

bytheendofhersenior year herconflicting feelings were
making herthink that she’d like totrysomething different.
When shewent offtocollege, Iwas able tokeep intouch
with herbyphone forthatfirst year. I’dseeherinperson on
breaks from school and was happy toseehow well she
adjusted tohernew life. After herfirst year ofcollege,
though, things changed.
Romance and First Love
Sara’s tears slowly welled from her reddened eyes and
trickled down hercheeks asshetold mehow horrible her
situation was during hersummer break after herfreshman
year. Attheendofherfirst semester, shehadfallen inlove
with asophomore atschool andthey decided tospend their
summer together, working atjobs during theweek thatthey
were fortunate enough togetintown, andthen being with
each other andfriends ontheweekends. Ithadbeen anideal
summer andSara could notbelieve itwasover. Sowhat was
the problem?
Jared, herboyfriend, was going toSouth America forhis
junior year abroad. He’d beliving inthedormitory there with
other exchange students from around theworld. Sara was
worried that Jared would find another love.
Sara’s relationship with Jared began attheend ofherfirst
semester. Iwas relieved thatshehadn’t methim earlier, asI
hadhoped shewould beable toexperience thestrength ofher
newfound ability tosoothe herown innate reactivity without
theassistance ofaboyfriend. Her lastyear ofhigh school
enabled hertomove away from heremotional dependence on
herparents asshe relied more and more onfriends for
support. That’s part oftheadolescent journey, toconnect
263

more with peers than parents. During herhigh school senior
year “freak-out” about leaving home, itwas anatural state,
given hertemperament, tofeel that leaving herfriends and
leaving her parents was just “too much.” Now she had
learned, with some internal education, that shecould calm
herself. That was a great step in strengthening her mind.
Jared entered thescene ataschool party oneweekend. The
twometandSara began tofeelfeelings shehadheard about
from friends andmovies andbooks, butinallofherdating
andhooking uphadnever experienced. When shesaw Jared
atthedorm event, shefeltanimmediate sense ofattraction to
him. Jared was asweet andsensitive person. Unlike Sara, he
seemed not tobereactive inthe ways that she was,
fortunately, sohecould approach herand thenewness of
herwith calm andfocus. They made a“great pair,” Sara told
me.Theendofthatsemester wasfunforthem both. They got
closer and closer, and soon their dancing and talking and
going out together became “romantic.”
Sara told methatthough shehadhooked upwith other boys
incollege asshehadinhigh school, they never really meant
thatmuch toher.Jared wasthefirst guywho shereally liked,
who shereally cared about. Itsomehow seemed different to
herthan theinformal sexual encounters shehadhadinhigh
school. This really mattered toher,shesaid, andshewanted
towait until sheknew Jared forawhile before things became
sexual. And Jared, too,waspatient enough towait until things
happened naturally.
Throughout thesecond semester ofherfreshman year, Sara
andJared were sexually intimate with each other. Sara went
tothecollege health clinic andstarted birth control pills, and
both ofthem got checked forAIDS and other sexually
264

transmitted diseases before engaging even in
condom-protected sexual intercourse. Iwassurprised bytheir
conscientious approach tosuch animportant issue that Sara
would have treated before with casual disregard. Somehow a
more reflective andthoughtful partofherwasbeing engaged
with her sexual life now that these new feelings were
emerging.
When Sara’s parents found out that she had asteady
boyfriend, hermother was overjoyed, butherfather was
nervous, Sara said. Notuntil herdadmetJared inperson did
heseem torelax. “He justneeded toseewho Jared issohe
could know Iwasn’t being hurt bythisguy.” Asafather I
know that feeling ofwanting tobeprotective while also
wanting tosupport. It’stheparental challenge ofbeing asafe
harbor and alaunching pad allatonce. It’snotsoeasy
sometimes.
Inmany ways, this was anideal way toget into the
experience ofromance forSara. She learned that shecould
have intense feelings ofattraction thatwere mutually shared
byherpartner. Shelearned thathertiming formoving from
feelings ofattraction togetting toknow Jared tobecoming
sexually involved with him could bediscussed openly and
respectfully. This was thelongest lasting relationship Jared
hadhad, too,sohewasalsolearning alotofnew things about
romance and emotional involvement.
And now it was August.
Isaid toSara that Iimagined shemight befeeling avery
intense sense ofloss over what was going onright now. She
hadbecome very attached toJared, Iexplained, andthatwas
beautiful. Ourromantic lifeisintimately interwoven with our
265

attachments. Some researchers, likeHelen Fisher, suggest that
atleast three kinds oflove exist, which Imentioned briefly in
the last section.
When weareromantic we“fall inlove” and have adeep
sense oflonging tobewith someone, think about theperson
when heorsheisnotaround, andfeeladeep sense ofloss
when they leave. When thecommitted relationship ends, or
threatens toend, wecanfeelabsolutely bereft. It’slikeapart
ofusisbeing amputated. Weareripped apart. Webecome
not whole. Something is missing.
That’s the“addiction” part oflove that drives poets and
songwriters todevote somuch time andenergy totrying to
express thepain andpleasure ofromance. Like other forms of
addiction, scientists think dopamine may bethe main
neurochemical involved inthisaspect oflove. Ononelevel,
this isa“healthy addiction” that creates happiness inour
lives. Onanother level, when therelationship isending or
uncertain, itcancreate huge pain within us.Thevery parts of
thebrain thatregister bodily pain also represent thepain ofa
severed relationship. Itcanfeellikewearebeing stabbed and
are dying.
Then there’s thesexual orerotic aspect oflove, theattraction
andarousal. This libido orsexual energy isanatural part of
ourexperience. Itdoesn’t always come along with romance,
sothese two feelings can besomewhat independent. This
form oflove may beprimarily mediated byandrogens, aform
ofhormone associated with increases insexdrive. Infact,
hooking up,asSara hadlearned, often involves sexual arousal
andnotromantic engagement. “One-night stands” aregood
examples ofthepassionate engagement ofthiserotic form of
a “loving” experience.
266

Forsome, sexual intercourse involves notonly theandrogens
that help mediate arousal butalso thesecretion ofoxytocin,
thehormone thatgenerally intensifies ourfeelings. Some of
thisintensification canbetoenhance asense ofbonding and
connection. But beaware that this intensification can be,
especially formales, anintensification ofjealousy and
aggression. Forothers, especially intense forfemales, sexual
intercourse isassociated with oxytocin release; theperson one
iswith becomes theperson ofone’s bonding. This bonding
can beinthe form ofromance. Inthis case, sexual
involvement can create anintensification ofromantic
dopamine-driven obsession. Attimes, thatobsession may not
be shared, and such imbalance may be quite distressing.
Oxytocin release canalso beapart ofthenext form oflove,
attachment.
Attachment, thethird form oflove, iswhat wefeel inour
close friendships anditiswhat wefeel toward ourparents
andmay involve primarily theserotonin system. Attachment
isthekind oflove inwhich wewant tooffer thenurturance
that others need tohelp them feel safe, seen, soothed, and
secure. When wearedistressed, going toanattachment figure
soothes us.Being around asecure attachment figure calms
ourinner turmoil andgives usafeeling ofbeing “home” and
atease. This iswhy children canbesoothed byanattachment
figure with whom they have asecure attachment. And thisis
why connecting with aclose friend issoothing. This iswhy
even ourromantic partner andoursexual companion who is
also ourattachment figure canbesosoothing. Itispossible to
have all three forms of love shared with one person.
When oneindividual isyour romantic partner (you areinlove
with someone), your sexual companion (you love making
267

love together), and your attachment figure (you love being
around thisperson andgotohimorherattimes ofdistress or
when you want toshare something positive), it’s a
relationship jackpot.
Not allromantic, sexual, andattachment relationships work
outlike this. Wecanimagine allthecombinations that can
exist: having allthree, just two, oronly one form oflove
present. When it’snotbalanced between twopeople, itcanbe
really upsetting foroneperson who wants more, andeven for
theperson who wants less. Butwhen thebalance isallthere,
it’soneofthemost rewarding experiences wecanhave. Jared
was allthree forSara. And Sara was allthree forJared.
Jackpot.
Forme,Sara began tolook much likeshedidhersenior year
ofhigh school justayear andahalf earlier. She was filled
with sadness andseparation distress, theemotional state that
was her“go-to” default mode oftemperament when shewas
upset. What hadhappened toallofthegrowth andprogress
she had made? Why was she now so “dependent” on Jared?
268

Yes, youmay say,sheisinlove with himanddoesn’t want to
leave him. Maybe sheshould take offandgodown toSouth
America with him? Well, Ican understand theromantic
sensibility ofthat suggestion, butIdon’t agree. Atthisage,
during theimportant adolescent period oftime ofgrowing
into who you arebecoming, Ibelieve that itmakes more
sense tofind your own equilibrium and direction without
changing plans tomaintain aromantic relationship. And
believe me,I’mapretty romantic guy. It’slikewhat anolder
adolescent inhertwenties recently suggested: “Tell your
reader nottogetcommitted tooearly. Ifitisgoing towork
out, it will work out.”
269

Ifyou’ve seen thefilms Before Sunrise andBefore Sunset, by
thedirector Richard Linklater, you’ve seen upclose and
personal thedilemma someone inhisadolescent years has
when hemeets upwith a“soul mate” with whom hefeels so
aligned, soconnected, sobonded. Iknow from personal
experience how thetiming ofsuch connections makes ahuge
difference. Iknow, too,many people who meet upatthisage
and don’t give themselves thespace tocreate their own
identity, andthen years andsometimes decades pass byandit
comes back tohaunt them. There isanimportant maturation
during adolescence thatrequires afreedom ofemotional life,
thinking, planning, and plain old self-discovery that
committed relationships can sometimes curtail.
Please don’t getmewrong: Iwould notbesurprised ifJared
andSara ultimately find alifelong commitment toeach other.
It’svery possible. Ijust don’t think they should make that
serious commitment right now atthistime intheir journeys. I
think they both would come toresent thatdecision andeach
other.
Buthow could Ihelp Sara getthrough thisperiod? Intherapy
Idon’t tellpeople what todo,Itrytobepresent with them to
help them figure outhow tofigure outwhat todo.The
following sections offer examples ofafewsteps parents and
other adults attempting tooffer encouragement toadolescents
cantake tohelp support them through theintensity offirst
love and the endings of relationships.
First Be Present
What seemed tohelp Sara alotwas formetofirst connect
with exactly where shewas. What thismeans isthatIfocused
onjustwhat was going oninside Sara, helping hertoSIFT
270

hermind bysensing, observing, anddescribing hersensations
(what shefeels inherbody), herimages (what shehears and
sees inhermind’s eye), herfeelings (what emotions sheis
aware of),andherthoughts (intheform ofideas orconcepts
andword-based thinking). When wehelp others toSIFT their
minds, wearehelping them create afocused space inwhich
they canexplore their own inner sea. This mindsight skill is
bynomeans thedomain only oftherapists such asme.
Anyone who iswilling tostay present foranother person can
do it.
Inany close relationship, connection means becoming a
PART ofthecommunication inthat moment. Bybeing
present forwhat ishappening asitishappening, attuning to
theinner experience ofwhat isgoing onwith theother
person—not just totheir external behaviors but actually
resonating with their internal experience—a trust isborn.
That state oftrust between usturns onwhat Steve Porges
calls the“social engagement system.” This system calms the
internal storms, relaxes astate ofdistress, andcreates asense
ofopenness tonew experience. This isafundamental way in
which being present notonly allows ustounderstand another
person, butalso allows that connection tocreate clarity and
calmness inside that person.
Once Sara could share thesensations ofheaviness inherchest
andtheempty pitinherstomach, theimages ofbeing alone in
her sophomore year and ofJared with other women in
Argentina, herfeelings offearandrejection, andherthoughts
that she’d never find another love like him, wehadSIFTed
through thecontents ofhermind atthismoment inherlife
and she was able to feel truly felt.
271

You might ask what words Isaid, ifany, during our
connection. Mostly mywords were aimed atshowing herthat
Iunderstood herfeelings, thatIcould imagine what shemight
befeeling because Ihadexperienced some ofthese feelings
myself. Isaid that Iunderstood what shewas saying and
could feelhow painful thiswas, andhow itseemed there was
nosolution tothis situation butloss. After wespoke fora
while about thissense ofbeing stuck, andofhow ironic itwas
that anexperience sopowerfully good could change and
create such powerfully painful feelings, Isaid something
about ourcommon human predicament. Tofeelsuch elation
means wesometimes will feelintense loss. They gohand in
hand.
Acommon andparallel metaphor Ishared with Sara seemed
tohelp andgoes likethis. Ifyoutake ateaspoon ofsaltand
putitintoasmall cupofwater, thatwater willtaste toosalty
todrink. Butifyouimagine putting thatsame teaspoon ofsalt
intoalake, thewater willremain clear tothetaste. That’s like
thedifference between getting lostontherimoftheWheel of
Awareness andexperiencing lifefrom thehub. Opening the
hub ofthewheel enables whatever feelings that arise tobe
experienced within adeep reservoir that gives usresilience.
That’s theclear taste ofdiluting thesaltinthelarger body of
water. Wecanfeelwhatever feelings arise, notfretover them,
andstay fully present asweembrace awider awareness of
knowing beyond only theone feeling orthought oridea.
That’s how thewheel practice strengthens themind tobe
present asweopen thehub and become empowered to
embrace our experiences with more clarity.
This kind ofpresence isattheheart ofwhat itmeans tobe
your own best friend. You areavailable toyourself asan
272

attachment figure, asaclose companion, asasupport, andas
aguide. Anything thatcomes up,youcanshare. This iswhat
youdowith your social best friend; thisiswhat youdowith
yourself as best friend.
Repairing Ruptures
Presence enables ustodevelop resilience. Ifocused now with
Sara onreinforcing thisskill that wehadworked onearlier
when shewasinhigh school andfound thewheel practice to
besohelpful andempowering. Ialso now wanted hertohave
theknowledge about thethree forms oflove. Inparticular, I
wanted hertoconsider thispossibility. Jared hadbecome an
attachment figure forher, alongside hisbeing aromantic
partner andasexual companion. Three forms oflove inone
relationship—bingo. Nowonder sheloved being with him
anddidn’t want tolose thisrelationship. Butasanattachment
figure, Jared may have become theperson shenow relied on
forallofhersoothing. Sowhile shemade thetransition to
college well, learning torely onherself tosoothe her
intensely reactive temperament inanexcellent way, perhaps
herrelationship with Jared after that first semester—being
273

with himessentially allthetime forthelastnine months—had
made hernotpractice being herown best friend. Perhaps Sara
had given upherown inner resilience forthecompelling
nature of her new love.
Changes and Challenges to Integration
Idescribed toSara how integration isthe linkage of
differentiated parts—like connecting thedifferent aspects of
ourselves, orlikehonoring differences with another person in
arelationship and then connecting with that person. And
well-being emerges from integration. When ourinner mental
experience andourinterpersonal relationships areintegrated,
harmony emerges. Without integration wemove toward chaos
ortoward rigidity. Sara’s “stuck” response totheprospect of
Jared being away forayear was, inasense, rigid and
inflexible. What was notbeing integrated inSara’s lifenow?
What was notbeing differentiated andlinked? Sara was not
letting Jared differentiate himself from her. Hehadhisown
ideas forthenext step inhislifejourney tofully experience a
year abroad, andshewas fantasizing about how tojoin him
andnotallow himtohave thatindividualized journey unfold.
Sara andJared hadbeen very linked. Now, soearly intheir
lives, it was time to allow more differentiation between them.
Sara hadherown work todo,too.Shehadgiven upsome of
herfriendships inorder tospend more andmore time with
Jared. Relationships, ItoldSara, arelikeagarden. They need
tending tokeep growing and thriving across time. Close
relationships need devotion anddedication, yes.Butthey also
thrive ifthey have thebalance ofdifferentiation andlinkage.
Too much ofoneover theother andintegration isnotcreated.
You can always tellarelationship that isoutofbalance
because one orboth people appear inarepeated state of
274

chaos, with fitsofrage. And they canreveal rigidity, too,and
sometimes display asense ofenveloping boredom andlossof
vitality. While allrelationships meander attimes toward
chaos or,theseeming opposite, boredom, with integration
there isafeeling ofharmony and energy, openness and
vitality.
Itold Sara that atthis stage perhaps shefeared toomuch
differentiation andlosing Jared. And Iexplained why attheir
young age, theoldadage “Ifyou love someone, setthem
free” had special relevance.
The other issue forSara was thatherattachment system was
triggered byherrelationship with Jared. Toacertain extent,
shehadbeen relying onhimasanattachment figure, asifhe
were aparent andshehisyoung child. Ofcourse thismeant
that hismoving away forayear was absolutely terrifying.
Sara needed tolearn tosoothe the“younger Sara” inside her
byspeaking directly tothatyoung side ofherself, thatyoung
state ofmind, and letting that part ofherself know that
everything would beokay, thatshewould notbeignored or
forgotten. Aswe’ve seen inMindsight Practice FinPart I,for
some people placing onehand onthechest andonehand on
theabdomen, applying some gentle pressure andclosing the
eyes, canbecomforting andasource ofsoothing aswell. This
helped Sara tofind away tocomfort herfeelings oflonging
and distress and find an inner sense of peace.
275

Fortunately, these ideas andsuggestions, aswell asherpast
experience with practices liketheWheel ofAwareness when
shewasanxious about leaving home forcollege, helped Sara
alot.She was able toface herintense fears and distress
head-on andtosoothe herself. She also understood that she
could feelwhatever shewasfeeling andjustletthatbewhere
shewasatthatvery moment. That’s presence, andthat’s what
created apathway for Sara’s sense ofclarity and
empowerment. Sheiscurrently missing Jared butnotfretting
over himasshehasbeen able tofind aninternal balance and
continues to cultivate integration in the garden of her life.
Acceptance, Letting Go ofExpectations, and Sexual
Orientation
Aswehave discussed, presence isthemost fundamental gift
thatwecangive ourchildren interms ofcreating apositive
environment forthem todevelop and grow. One ofthe
greatest challenges wemay face inourwork tostay present
forourchildren, however, isourown expectations forthem.
276

Whether you areanoutgoing parent who has ashy or
introverted child, oranathletic parent who hasanartistically
inclined teen who steers clear ofsports, thisissue ofhow to
bepresent forwho your adolescent actually iscreates the
most important starting point for all of us as parents.
Fear and anger arewords that don’t quite describe the
emotions that Andy’s parents expressed tomeontheir first
visit tomyoffice after their fourteen-year-old sontold them
inourfamily session thathemight begay. Ihadbeen seeing
Andy for issues related toanxiety and poor academic
performance forover ayear. Andy was abright young
eighth-grader who had come topsychotherapy atthe
suggestion ofhisschool counselor andupon theinsistence of
hisparents. Initially uninterested inbeing inanoffice with a
stranger, Andy soon warmed uptotheidea thatheandIcould
just talk about whatever came to mind.
Andy andIinitially spoke about hisfriends atschool, many
ofwhom hehad known since preschool days. He, like
virtually allofus,could not recall those times before
elementary school very well buthadasense thathehadbeen
happy inthose early years andthathislifeandhisfriendships
had been “fine.”
Iwas interested toseeifAndy could tellmeanything about
hisunderstanding ofwhy hewas soanxious atschool. He
recalled doing well inelementary school, recounting his
interest inallhisclasses andsports andartafter school. He
had alove ofdrama and afascination with science and
seemed tobeaRenaissance man, interested inmany
dimensions oflifeandexcelling inlotsofthings. Andy wasa
person with deep passions about theworld around him.
277

During those earlier elementary school days, hetold me,he
“wasn’t anxious, just happy.”
When sixth grade came along, things began tochange.
Hemoved from asmall local public elementary school toa
much larger middle school farther from hishome. Herecalled
making this transition without much problem, making new
friends, and even continuing todowell with hisclasses in
school. But bythemiddle ofthat year, hefeltapitinhis
stomach when Sunday night would come around. Hebegan to
dislike theidea ofgoing toschool, andonMonday mornings
heoften feltasifhewas coming down with thefluorsome
kind offood poisoning. Hefeltsick tohisstomach. His
parents soon noticed thispattern ofMonday distress, andafter
afewmonths ofhisgrades falling andtheir trying tofigure
outwith histeachers what might begoing on,they followed
histeachers’ advice andbrought himintoseemetoward the
end of that academic year.
Myown experience ofAndy during seventh grade was that
hisMonday morning anxiety was more about hissocial life
than about hisacademics. Hehad continued toenjoy his
classes, worked diligently tokeep upwith hishomework and
assignments, and committed himself perhaps totoomany
activities butones hereally enjoyed. Heloved soccer, was
excited about drama, loved hisartclasses after school, and
enjoyed just being with his friends.
What slowly became clear during that seventh grade year,
however, was that Andy was becoming aware offeelings
inside him that were new. Like most adolescents, the
physiological changes inhisprimary sexual organs—testicles
foraboy andovaries foragirl—gave risetoanumber of
278

secondary sexual changes. Andy’s body was physically
changing, and so were his internal sensations.
One dayAndy described tomethefeeling ofbeing attracted
toaparticular player onhissoccer team. While histeammates
would begawking atsome ofthegirls’ soccer team players
down thefield, Andy found hiseyes turning toward hisown
teammates, andoneinparticular. When thisdirection ofhis
attention kept happening, when feelings ofinterest and
arousal arose inside him, hebegan tofeelscared. Hesaid to
methat he“knew that wasn’t right” butthat itwas simply
what he felt.
Emotion isadeep process that not only gives usthe
subjective sense ofourfeelings, butalso orients ourattention
andletsushave afeltsense of“This isimportant.” Inthis
way, Andy was having anemotional experience thatlethim
know what mattered tohim. Hedidnotintentionally create
this emotional response, hedid not choose tofocus his
attention onboys oronthatoneboy, itwas simply what his
body’s brain was creating inside him.
Formetohelp Andy’s parents learn tobepresent forhim, I
needed tohelp them beopen towhat Andy was going
through. While Andy’s sexual maturation was happening at
thesame time asthemajority ofyoung people inoursociety,
Andy was inthe minority ofindividuals whose sexual
orientation was nottoward someone oftheopposite gender.
Andy was having sexual andromantic fantasies about other
males. Decades ago, thisorientation would have erroneously
been called an“illness,” butnow weknow thathomosexuality
isnotadisorder. Justaspeople who areleft-handed areinthe
minority andthisis(usually nowadays) notseen asevidence
ofa“problem,” having asexual orientation that isinthe
279

minority does notmake homosexuality adysfunction. There
arestill some individuals who view homosexuality asa
condition that should bealtered clinically orotherwise, but
these aremistaken views from anot-so-distant past. Being
sexually attracted topeople ofyour own gender isnota
“condition” to be treated professionally.
Solet’s keep track ofthat asweseehow Andy’s parents
could bepresent with himandwho hetruly issothatthey can
support him living as an authentic self.
Being present iswhat Andy’s parents needed tobecome.
Presence isaway ofkeeping trust alive and keeping
connections strong and communication wide open. That
doesn’t mean becoming permissive parents, where anything
goes. Authoritative parenting where structure isapparent but
connection and communication are equally valued is the goal.
ButJudy andPeter, Andy’s parents, though they claimed to
beopen-minded people, were each intheir own way notopen
toAndy’s sexual orientation. Asthemajority ofindividuals in
thepopulation areheterosexual, itisunderstandable that, by
simple statistics ofprobability, noparents would expect that
their child would have ahomosexual orientation. And thisis
exactly thepoint: Tobepresent weneed tobeopen tolife,to
beopen tothings occurring that are beyond what our
expectations created forus.Being present enables usto
become freed from the “shoulds” oflife, letting goof
expectations andbeing open towhat isactually happening. In
mindful awareness, weletgoofexpectations andareopen to
what is.Remember theCOAL combination ofcuriosity,
openness, acceptance, andlove from ourtime-in practices in
Mindsight Tools #2?This COAL state isthestance wetake
when we are present.
280

Presence cultivates authenticity in how we live.
Naturally wecome tolifewith expectations. This isjustthe
way thebrain works. Itisananticipation machine, setting up
from prior experiences aneurological filter thatenables usto
getready forthenext thing. Wesurvive intheworld because
ofthese filters. Wemake sense oftheworld and then get
ready forwhat theworld islikely todish upforus.That’s
what expectations empower ustodo.But thedownside of
such expectations isthatthey canmake itdifficult forusto
clearly see what is in front of us, or even inside us.
Insimple terms, there isnosuch thing as“immaculate
perception.”
Wecanwork onbeing present inanapproach thatletsgoof
ourexpectational mind-sets, ourpreviously created judgments
or“pre-judgments,” and webring into perceptions amore
direct, unfiltered input ofwhat is.Inthisway, being present,
learning tointentionally letgoofexpectations, enables usto
become mindfully aware ofwhat ishappening. This isthe
receptive perceptual stance wecantake when wearepresent
in life.
Themind-set thatachild willhave aheterosexual orientation
isunderstandable given thestatistics (that is,it’smore likely
tobethecase), butitisaninnate bias, anexpectation, that
made itdifficult forAndy’s parents toseeAndy forwho he
is.Ifthismental model inside them ofwhat isexpected turned
into arigid model ofwhat “should” happen, then presence
would beimpaired. When wehave fixed expectations, we
cannot seeclearly. Our prior learning (what thesociety and
ourfamily andourown individual experiences have taught
us)cancreate mental models that aretheperceptual filters
281

thatskew ourview ofpresent experience through alens that
biases what weseeinthemoment. Expectations become
fixed, and mental “shoulds” distort what weareopen to
seeing and accepting.
Even ifwethink wedon’t have these biases andexpectations,
our facial expressions and tone ofvoice may reveal
disappointment and disapproval. Weasparents need tobe
very conscious ofthedepths ofourresponses tounexpected
developments with ourchildren sothatwedon’t unwittingly
make them feeljudged, condemned, oreven invisible. Allof
these things can inhibit ourability tobepresent and can
threaten trust in our relationship with our child.
Studies oftemperament, forexample, reveal thattheultimate
developmental outcome for children isnot inwhat
temperament thechild has, buthow accepting theparent isto
that child’s individual characteristics. Ifyou feel loved for
who you areasachild oradolescent byyour parent (orfor
any ofusinallofourrelationships!), you will have the
foundation you need tothrive. Being seen andaccepted for
who you aremakes you feel good about yourself andhelps
give youaresilient mind. Your home base isstrong asasafe
harbor, andyour home base serves asasolid launching pad
from which to move out and explore the world.
282

When Ijoined thegirls’ modern dance class inhigh school,
myfather was very upset. Hetold methat hewas worried
“everyone would think you areahomosexual.” Iasked him
why that mattered, and hecould only look atmewith a
frightened andangry look onhisface. Formyself, Iknew that
joining theclass was what Iwanted todo.Iloved todance,
and found theactivities intheboys’ physical education
program uninteresting. Ididn’t really enjoy being shoved
around onthefootball field, even though Iwas oneofthe
fastest runners atmyhigh school and usually didn’t get
caught asawide receiver. And Iwasshort, sobasketball was
forever frustrating. Dance wasaway tofeelfree, andIloved
girls, andmany ofthem were inthatdance class, soitwas a
“no brainer” formetotransfer into that activity formy
physical education requirement. Itwas physical, and wow,
was that a great education.
Ifeltadeep sense ofbeing real, ofbeing truly myself, of
being authentically there inthatclass. Itwas apowerful and
283

life-changing step toignore myfather’s reaction and my
peers’ expectations and simply be me.
Like myfather, Andy’s parents were afraid that hispeers
would humiliate him. But also like myfather, there was
something more. Iasked Andy’s parents what they feltabout
Andy’s feelings ofbeing attracted toboys, andPeter, Andy’s
father, hadaterrified look onhisface. “Being ahomosexual
justisn’t right. There must besomething wrong here ...(long
silence) ...Those feelings just aren’t okay. ...What
happened toyou?” heasked Andy with astern voice and
terrified look on his face.
What “isn’t okay” about having afeeling that you
authentically have? Peter wasn’t alone when itcomes tomen
having what generically canbetermed “homophobia”—not
only afearofothers’ being homosexual andofhomosexuality
ingeneral, butalso afearthathehimself might begay. Some
ofthat fear may arise from thespectrum ofsexual feelings
thatarequite natural tohave inmammalian life.Sexual urges
awaken, genitals become engorged with blood, impulses and
sensations emerge, behaviors tomove toward individuals to
whom weareattracted start to“take over” our external
movements, sometimes even before weareaware ofthem.
Wecanknow what wefeelbyhow ourbodies behave. And
forayoung teen, sometimes those feelings surface forawide
range ofpeople—same age, younger orolder, same gender or
different. Sexuality isanatural feeling, and thesense of
attraction arises along aspectrum. Unlike our external
genitals and chromosomes that areusually (there aresome
rareexceptions) either male orfemale, oursexual arousal can
begenerated from interacting with awide array of
individuals. That’s just human nature.
284

Yetthisuncertainty oftheobject ofoursexual attraction can
create anxiety forsome people. Mindsight helps usseethat
this spectrum ofsexual feelings isquite different from the
internal—often hidden—mental model most ofushave ofa
fixed sexual orientation. That is,many people have abelief
that you should beattracted only topeople oftheopposite
gender. The violation ofthis expectation canagitate some
people. Infact, having sexual arousal toward someone ofthe
same gender can create panic. And having sexual arousal
toward people ofboth genders canbebefuddling. Ihave met
many patients whose natural spectrum oftheir own feelings
freaks them out. They “clamp down” ontheir own inner
experience inorder toconform tothemental model they’ve
learned from family andsociety thatsays boys likegirls and
girls like boys. No exceptions to this rule. Period.
We’ve seen that aviolation ofexpectation can create
profound anxiety and acascade ofinternal and external
reactions. The internal reactions tosuch aviolation can
include shutting down freedom offeeling, creating acascade
ofthought processes thatcondemn such ambiguity offeelings
intheself and others, and even adeep fear reaction that
becomes acomplex web ofanger toward anyone else who
may evoke such aspectrum ofsexual feelings within the
person. You canimagine perhaps how such internal reactions
are anattempt ofthe mind toreduce the anxiety of
uncertainty. Buttheirony isthat therigid response tosuch
initial chaotic reactions toanatural spectrum offeelings also
shuts the individual into a prison of their own making.
Anger “projected outward” onto others who show adeviation
from thesocietal norm isaprimitive defense that isan
ineffective and sometimes violent attempt toshut down
285

awareness oftheinitial spectrum ofinternal feelings that
created thenow forgotten anxiety. That anxiety may have
been about one’s own internal experience andidentity. For
some, theinitiating anxiety may besimply about notknowing
what todowith those feelings. Fantasies, dreams, bodily
sensations, andimpulses directed toward same-gender people
may evoke confusion, anxiety, andfear. Rather than simply
feeling these feelings, there isasetofreactions against
having them. These unexpected andtherefore uncomfortable
feelings can be“defended” against bybeing shifted into
outward directed emotions and behaviors: fear ofothers’
homosexual feelings, notone’s own; anger toward others’
homosexuality, notone’s own. These projected feelings and
reactions areoften soautomatic thattheprojecting individual
hasnoconscious idea that such homophobic reactivity is
coming from their own inner sense ofvulnerability. Quite the
contrary, being aware ofone’s own vulnerability isoften the
last thing on the angry, fearful person’s mind.
With allofthese possibilities inmind, Igently tried toalign
myself with Peter’s experience. Ihadtobepresent with him,
tobeopen towhat hisexperience wasright atthatmoment in
time. With Andy’s permission (and relief), Itook some time
alone with Peter andAndy’s mom, Judy, tohelp give them all
thespace away from oneanother they needed toexplore some
ofthese issues andwhatever might begoing onineach of
them.
Judy was able tostate thatsheherself was mostly frightened
ofAIDS andthesocial exclusion Andy might experience by
being gay. Her fears were quite understandable, and aswe
discussed together thenotion that “being gay” was nota
choice butabiological reality, shewas able tosense thatthe
286

work sheneeded todowastoembrace these challenges ofhis
new reality. Shestillfeltscared, scared thathecould getillor
beostracized, butshewas open tothefundamental idea that
what Andy really needed washerlove andsupport. This love
could beexpressed byherlearning tobepresent forhim—to
be curious, open, accepting, and loving.
Peter listened tothisdiscussion silently, hisface appearing
terrified aswespoke. Astheconversation turned toward him,
hisfearquickly mutated intofury. Atfirst heblamed Judy for
being “too doting” over Andy when hewas ababy. Then he
turned hisanger toward me,saying that“therapy brainwashes
people” andthat Ifailed tohelp Andy bymaking him “too
soft” with this“therapy crap” andthatIpushed him toward
this“gay stuff.” AsJudy andIlethimexpress hisviewpoints,
Peter said that this was the“worst thing that could have
happened to him.”
Asatherapist, part ofthechallenge istoblend theneed to
give people thespace tofind outtheir own inner truths with
theneed toclarify what isscientifically known about how we
develop. Iacknowledged toPeter and Judy that there is
indeed a“controversy” inthis and many other fields. Ilet
them know thatsome small group oftherapists would tryto
convince Andy thatheisnotgay. Iinvited them tofind such
therapists ifthey wanted to.Butinmyscientific andclinical
opinion, research and experience suggested instead the
approach thatpeople should begiven thesupport todiscover
who they actually are.Italked tothem about thespectrum of
feelings and theneed toexplore those sensations inasafe
way sothatboth thebody andthemind remain healthy. When
afamily pushes foronly onesetoffeelings oridentities tobe
“permissible,” authentic feelings and identifications simply
287

gounderground, they don’t disappear. Italked tothem more
about presence andAndy’s need tofeeltheir acceptance and
support. Knowing thatAndy wasmyprimary patient andthat
Iwouldn’t have much time with hisparents beyond asession
or two, I then brought up the possible source of Peter’s fury.
What amazed meabout that extended session was that by
using mindsight skills ofseeing theinner world ofselfand
others with more stability, Peter’s response wasactually quite
open. Wedidsome breath-awareness practices toletthem
simply bewith their own internal world. And then welet
whatever feelings and concerns that were there simply be
expressed andexplored. Perhaps itwas Judy’s readiness to
help him change, perhaps itwas thesense ofinevitability of
Andy’s identity, andperhaps itwas histrue love forhisson
andfamily that contributed totheopening ofPeter’s mind.
Whatever elements, the time felt right and we dove in.
Byexamining thegeneral issues—the ways thebrain works
and how relationships support the emergence ofour
288

minds—we could then focus onthespecifics with aneutrality
thatwasacrucial starting place. This wasnolonger justabout
Andy ortheir family, itwasabout being human. Embracing
theuniversal isapart ofself-compassion, asresearchers like
Kristin Neff define it.Weseethatwearenotalone, thatwe
are apart ofalarger, universal human drama. Being
compassionate toourselves also comes along with being
present andmindful ofthemoment, aswell asbeing kind to
ourselves and being gentle and caring.
Asmentioned earlier, kindness canbeseen astheway we
aresupportive andhonoring ofoneanother’s vulnerability. So
mywhole inner intention wastobekind. Now inmany ways,
integration made visible iskindness andcompassion. Soto
promote integration, Ineeded toempower Andy’s parents to
explore their own differentiated views, andthen tohelp them
link to Andy’s experience.
Tobesupportive ofPeter’s mind, tolethimbedifferentiated
inoursession, Ineeded tosuspend myown judgments and
expectations of“how afather should be”andinstead embrace
exactly where hewas. Ineeded toknow myown inner mental
sea, todifferentiate myself, andsoIreflected within myself
ontheexperiences Ihave had, including thejourney through
girls’ dance and myfather’s fearful reactions tothat, even
before thedays ofAIDS. With that inner knowing open in
myself, Icould beready tobeopen toPeter’s inner mental
sea.
Iremembered then what youandIhave been reviewing inour
conversation ofthefundamental stance wecantake: Chaos
andrigidity emerge from impairments tointegration. When
weareintegrated, weareinharmony. When wearenot
integrated, weareinstates ofchaos (wild, unpredictable) or
289

rigidity (stuck, paralyzed, unchanging). Peter’s response to
Andy’s experience wastobecome both rigid andchaotic. He
was clearly notinanopen state ofpresence, notinastate of
integration. Mygoal needed tobeopen towhere hewas, and
then tohelp himseeaway tomove toward amore integrated
way of being himself.
With allofthis inmind, myintention was tosimply use
mindsight tobepresent with Peter, attune tohisinner
experience, resonate with those inner states within myself,
and then allow trust toemerge naturally. Remember that
mindsight has these three components ofseeing inside
yourself, seeing inside another, and promoting integration.
Mindsight iswhat Icould offer toAndy’s family, anditis
what any parent can cultivate with their adolescent. And
naturally, itiswhat anadolescent canlearn todowith others
as well.
Peter struggled mightily with hisown fears and hisown
memories ofbeing ayoung boy inthe competitive,
sports-focused world ofhisfamily. Hisfather hadparticularly
emphasized histhree sons’ participation incontact sports,
especially football. Aswegave Peter thespace inthesession
tospeak thetruth, histruth, ofhisown upbringing, hethen
could move toward finding anew way ofapproaching his
son. The idea inmymind was tobepresent and enable
differentiation toflourish before wemight move ontothe
linkage that Andy sodesperately needed atthis vulnerable
time with his family.
Itwas tentative atfirst, butyou could seethelove both
parents hadforAndy shining through when wehadournext
session with thethree ofthem together. Peter told Andy that
hewastrying tobeopen towhat hewassaying, open towho
290

hewas, andthatheunderstood Andy wasjust“being himself”
andthathewould stand byhisside. There was amoment of
silence thatjusthung intheair,unmoving, andthen Peter got
upand walked over toAndy’s chair and without apause
Andy rose andthetwohugged each other inanembrace that
feltsuspended intime. Peter told Andy thathewould dohis
best to be the father Andy deserved.
None ofusknew exactly where Andy’s lifewould go,but
setting upthispresence ofhisparents was acrucial step for
himtofeelempowered tobecome themost fulfilled andfree,
to become the most authentic Andy that he could become.
291

292

Time hasunfolded well forAndy intheyears since those
initial sessions. Ifeeldeeply grateful thatPeter andJudy were
able toopen their minds toseeing Andy forwho hewas at
that time and forhiscourage tocontinue tobecome the
wonderful human being thatheis.Andy issupported inhis
childhood home byhisloving parents, andthathasmade all
the difference in his rewarding and authentic life.
Drug Use or Abuse?
One ofthegreatest challenges foradolescents and their
families canbethepotential fortheuse ofmind-altering
chemicals, which include alcohol and other recreational
drugs. Staying present asaparent inthe face ofan
adolescent’s drug involvement canbedifficult, especially if
you think that thisuseisaform ofabuse oraddiction. For
adolescents, while itmay feel very common and therefore
“safe” tobeinvolved with drugs, itisimportant to
acknowledge that drug usecanlead topowerful changes in
your internal experience andsocial relationships. Ifyour own
activity with mind-altering substances feels like itis
becoming something thatiscontrolling yourather than your
controlling it,understanding these issues canbeessential. In
order tostay fully present forthemeaning ofdrugs inyour
lifesothatyoucanmake decisions thatarebest foryour own
well-being, having some ofthebasic facts about thebrain and
drug useiscrucial. While these facts could occupy anentire
book, here I’llpresent afundamental framework thatIhope
will put drug use in perspective.
Asthedrive toexplore new ways ofexperiencing reality
emerges during adolescence, theuseofdrugs thatalter brain
function can bevery intriguing. We allhave differing
emotional reactions todrug use, from excitement andinterest
293

tofear andrepulsion. Whatever thescience orthelaws are
about using substances thatalter ourmental state, adults and
adolescents alike may use various ingested and inhaled
chemicals toalter their experience ofconsciousness,
including alcohol andmarijuana, psychedelic mushrooms and
cocaine.
There areatleast four fundamental drives thatcanmotivate
our increased use ofdrugs during theadolescent period.
These include experimentation, social connection,
self-medication, andaddiction. Let’s review each ofthese in
turn sowecan understand how theuse ofmind-altering
substances may affect ouradolescent growth andsocial life,
now and for our life in the future.
Alcohol isacommon drug used legally byadults andillegally
byindividuals under legislated minimum ages. For an
adolescent whose dopamine release isalready revved up,
drugs, including alcohol, thatdirectly increase therelease of
this transmitter create anespecially challenging mix of
drug-enhanced dopamine levels ontopofanalready activated
adolescent dopamine system. Inother words, adolescence isa
period notonly ofdrug experimentation toexplore novelty,
butalso ofvulnerability tobecoming physiologically drawn
to using and becoming addicted to alcohol and other drugs.
Asdiscussed inPart II,thedopamine system ismore reactive
inateen, with heightened release thatdrives ourreward and
sensation-seeking behaviors. Even inthe face ofthis
enhanced release, asmentioned earlier, thebaseline levels of
dopamine during adolescence areactually lower .What this
means isthat teens may beprone tofeeling “bored” unless
they are engaging innovelty-seeking behaviors. An
adolescent’s dopamine profile has lower troughs, higher
294

peaks. That’s theactivated reward system oftheadolescent
brain andonesource ofthelows andhighs oftheadolescent
mind. Sowhen werealize thatmany drugs arechemicals that
increase dopamine release, wecanseehow such substances
would beattractive toraise ourselves outoftheboredom ofa
trough. That’s justthenature ofadolescence thatmay make
usespecially prone atthistime tousedopamine-enhancing
substances.
We’ve seen thatadolescence isatime ofexperimentation, of
trying new things. Sothedrive toalter consciousness and
experience new ways ofperceiving andfeeling andthinking
isanatural outcome ofapush fornovelty andtheexperience
ofnew sensations. Novelty itself isrewarding and also
activates our dopamine release. One aspect ofthis
experimentation issimply totrysomething new. Another
dimension istowiden ourunderstanding ofreality byaltering
theusual patterns ofperception thatshape ourcommonly held
views ofreality. This issometimes referred toasan
exploration ofconsciousness oraspiritual search and may
involve psychedelic drugs such aspeyote orpsilocybin,
which have been used forthousands ofyears invarious
cultures. Some drugs used for the purpose ofaltering
consciousness donotinvolve dopamine, andbecause ofthis
they may influence aperson’s lifebutnotbeaddictive. This
drive toexpand consciousness andseelifewith new eyes is
important forsome drug users, adolescents oradults, butfor
others itismerely adrive toexperience something new
without a search to understand new meanings of life.
Experimentation with novelty islikely aprime reason why a
majority ofteens have been found touse mind-altering
substances nomatter what their parents may think orhave as
295

rules ofthehouse. Parents ofhigh school students areoften
surprised atsurveys revealing thatthemajority ofthejuniors
andseniors inhigh school have used alcohol andmarijuana. It
isimportant foradults torealize thatthis“norm” ofteenage
lifedoes notmake itright orpermissible; itdoes notmake it
safe orlegal; itsimply makes itvery likely that itis
happening. Todeny such areality asparents istoputour
heads inthesand. It’salso important toremember thathow
weapproach this aspect ofourteen’s lifewill shape our
relationship with our child for the years ahead.
The experimental aspect oftheuseofalcohol can bean
important dimension thatdrives aninitial interest indrinking
andgetting drunk. Forsome, there canbetheemergence of
anintense interest inusing alcohol inone’s social life. Recall
from thestory ofKatey, inPart II,that drinking alcohol
became animportant part ofherlifeand motivated herto
make decisions that got her expelled from high school.
Katey’s drinking hadalso become acentral partofhersocial
life, away sheconnected with friends and organized her
relationships. But inthesetting ofgroup alcohol use, the
tendency toengage inbinge drinking, consuming large
amounts ofalcohol inshort amounts oftime, isanespecially
risky behavior adolescents may beprone toengage in.From
thesocial point ofview, itisagroup activity, done with a
sense ofcamaraderie and ofaccomplishment—who can
consume themost booze? From themind point ofview, the
decision tolimit intake depends onexecutive functions that
become suspended after acouple ofdrinks. And from the
brain development perspective, alcohol poisoning hasbeen
clearly demonstrated tokillbrain cells andtheir connections,
especially inregions that control attention and memory.
Repeated bingeing damages the brain.
296

Group binge behavior reveals thesecond major reason people
usedrugs: tobepart ofacommon social fabric, part ofa
shared experience. Insome social circles andincertain social
settings such asparties orconcerts, drinking alcohol or
smoking marijuana may beanexpected behavior. The
lowering ofsocial anxiety andthelowering ofdefenses make
many people feelmore atease insocial settings, andsothese
drugs are used asa“social lubricant” that facilitates
communication. While Katey didn’t feel nervous insocial
situations, shedidenjoy the“fun ingetting smashed” with her
friends. Sheenjoyed theshared experience andalways drank
with someone, never byherself. Atleast thatwas true while
she was in high school.
Athird drive fordrug useisinitsroleasself-medication fora
primary psychiatric condition orapainful situation. For
example, someone with depression may feelsodown inthe
dumps that she wants to“go numb” byfrequently using
alcohol orshe may get herself “revved up” byusing
amphetamines. Someone with mania as apart of
manic-depressive orbipolar illness might use alcohol or
barbiturates toslow himself down. Aperson with
schizophrenia might usealcohol toquiet thehallucinations
and delusions that areterrifying forhim. For others with
attention deficit difficulties, the use ofstimulants may
temporarily increase thefocus ofsustained attention. And for
individuals with social anxiety, taking alcohol may decrease
their concerns insocial situations, whereas smoking
marijuana may inadvertently lead toanincrease intheir panic.
Katey did not have any ofthese underlying psychiatric
conditions, and itdidnotappear that shewas treating any
post-traumatic symptoms with alcohol use. It’scrucial tobe
sure that alcohol orstreet drugs arenotbeing used totreat
297

some underlying challenge toanindividual’s mental health.
Katey was not self-medicating as far as I could tell.
Afourth drive involved indrug use,onethatcanemerge after
drug usebegins, isaddiction. Katey showed some early signs
thatwere ofconcern tomeregarding herbecoming addicted
toalcohol, assheneeded touseincreasing amounts ofalcohol
togeta“buzz,” astate ofmind shebegan tocrave. This need
toincrease theamount ofaningested substance toachieve a
certain effect may have been asign ofher developing
tolerance tothedrug, possibly because herbrain was getting
used toitorherliver was more rapidly metabolizing it.
Tolerance isn’t necessary foraddiction, butitcanbepresent
andbeanimportant sign ofalarger issue unfolding. Katey
also became obsessed with theuseofalcohol inways thatfelt
more likeanaddiction than justapastime interest orapartof
hersocial life. Sheseemed tohave acraving thatwas more
than simply anenjoyment; ithadthequality ofwithdrawal
from thealcohol. This made meconcerned thatanaddiction
was developing inher. We began todiscuss whether her
preoccupation with alcohol and bringing theliquor tothe
party that gotherexpelled from school was more than just
“being ateenager,” asshehadsuggested. When Iasked herat
thetime shejustshrugged hershoulders andsaid, “Idon’t
know ... but I don’t think so.”
Addictive substances andaddictive behaviors, like shopping
orgambling, involve thereward circuit’s major transmitter,
dopamine. Aswe’ve seen, this isthetransmitter that is
already revved upinitsreactivity inadolescence. Dopamine
isreleased from abrainstem-related area, the nucleus
accumbens, and influences our limbic emotional,
motivational, evaluative, and memory systems, and
298

even pushes upinto ourcortex toinfluence ourthinking,
decision making, and behaviors. Alcohol can activate the
dopamine system inanyone, leading tosurges inthis
reward-based brain chemical.
Beyond stimulating adopamine surge that isespecially
intense inadolescents, alcohol andother drugs have animpact
ontheway ourminds seereality, asthey dampen cortical
functioning andalter ourconscious experience oftheworld.
Substances thatalter ourstate ofmind also alter ourcapacity
toresponsibly manage alarge vehicle asithurls through
space, ormanage ourown body asourconsciousness fails to
keep usalert. Some substances, too, especially iftaken in
excess orincombination with other substances, cankillyou. I
have two friends who lost anadolescent sonand daughter
because ofsuch experimental excesses, one inafatal car
accident, theother breathing inhervomit anddying alone in
her college dormitory room.
Sowhen adults getagitated about substance use, adolescents
should keep inmind that the adults may naturally be
concerned about their safety. One approach istoinsist on
total avoidance ofsuch substances, aposition many parents
likeKatey’s andherhigh school took. From theadolescents’
perspective, such apolicy may make nosense and seem
unrealistic, rigid, andunfair. Other parents take theposition
thatifteens aregoing toparticipate insuch activities, using
substances thatalter their state ofmind, they should dosoina
responsible way. The hopeful aimofsuch apolicy istosave
lives. “Call ifyou need aride home, noquestions asked.”
“Learn touse alcohol inmoderation.” “Avoid mixing
substances.” Helping kids manage their drug-related
activities, sothatwhen they areoutofthehouse they don’t’
299

“gowild with thefreedom they’ve been waiting tohave” and
drink themselves into oblivion, canbeacrucial first step in
helping adolescents navigate this challenging terrain.
Addressing thepossibility ofaddiction atthistime inlifeis
important. Adolescence isaperiod ofgreat riskfornotonly
using mind-altering drugs but also abusing them and
becoming addicted tothem. Asadolescents webegin to
experiment with many drugs that activate thedopamine
system, anditisduring ouradolescent period thatthebrain is
most sensitive tobecoming addicted toasubstance. Our
changing adolescent brain isespecially vulnerable torespond
todrug usewith theonset ofacascade ofbehavioral and
physiological responses thatcancontribute toaddiction. Such
vulnerability toaddiction isdue toboth theactivation of
certain genes andthealtering ofneural functioning, making
thedopamine release dependent ondrug use. The earlier in
adolescence weareexposed toalcohol anddrugs, themore
likely we are to develop an addiction.
Think ofitthisway. Addiction iswhere wegetused tothe
dopamine surge anactivity orsubstance creates inthe
brainstem andlimbic regions thatpushes ourcortex tomake
decisions regarding ourbehavior tocontinue todothings that
may bedestructive tous.Infact, asimple way ofdefining an
addiction iswhen people continue todosomething that is
destructive even after they know itishurting their life. The
boundary between drug abuse and addiction can bequite
hazy.
InKatey’s situation shewas discovering that shecould not
stop drinking, even after that party andherexpulsion. And
shecould notstop drinking after justonedrink, either. Itis
truethatonce youareintoxicated, thevery prefrontal regions
300

thatwould help youdecide tostop drinking gooff-line. Even
onedrink, forsome individuals, cancreate sudden andintense
shifts injudgment—like thediscerning judgment nottodrive
acarwhile intoxicated. Forsome, justonedrink canchange
their personality, and they may noteven remember what
happened to them. Others can experience a blackout after a lot
ofdrinking. This isdifferent from passing outinthat when
youareinablackout, youareaware, more orless, ofwhat is
happening. Butwhile youwere drinking, your limbic memory
region, thehippocampus, had soshut down that, afterward
you simply don’t recall what happened to you.
Even when Katey was notactively under alcohol’s direct
effects, alcohol was still influencing her life during high
school. She didn’t have blackouts, she could “hold her
liquor,” and shedidn’t drink alone. Yet Katey’s interest in
alcohol felt like something more than just aninterest in
exploring other states ofconsciousness with herfriends; it
wasmore than experimental andmore than social. There was
something intheway shetalked about getting “smashed” that
hadthesense ofsome intense dopamine-driven-reward circuit
speaking through her. She was intensely focused onalcohol
and itseffects onher life. For some individuals who
experiment with drugs andalcohol toalter their state ofmind
temporarily, such dopamine-surge-driven behaviors lead toan
alteration in their lives in long-term ways.
Some studies suggest that inthose atrisk, and especially
during our adolescent period, agene inside our brain’s
motivational circuitry isactivated when aparticular substance
isingested. Once thisgene activation occurs, thedopamine
circuit locks ontoacertain “substance ofchoice” and an
intense focus ofattention, thought, energy, and behavior is
301

directed tothesubstance. Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines,
barbiturates, and heroin can allactivate that circuit. Rats
given cocaine, for example, will choose that
dopamine-stimulating drug over food and then die of
starvation. With people, studies reveal that this dopamine
surge isreleased notonly when taking thesubstance buteven
when planning totake it,when thinking about it,when being
around people with whom ithasbeen taken, when insimilar
rooms where itwas taken, when getting ready totake it.In
short, theintense release ofdopamine, which gives you the
feeling ofurge andthedrive forreward, occurs both with the
ingestion and with the intention behind use of that substance.
That’s the cycle of addiction.
Thebroader story oftheroledopamine plays inourlives goes
likethis. When wework hard atsomething andfinally finish
it,like writing anessay orabook, creating apainting,
learning apiece ofmusic, constructing amodel airplane,
practicing asport, orgoing foralong hike, dopamine rises
and that disciplined effort isrewarded. There isnosudden
peak, nodopamine surge, butthere isagradual rise in
dopamine levels above baseline thatgives usafeeling ofdeep
satisfaction, afullness, apride inouraccomplishment. Weget
lostintheflow ofsomething welove, andwegetpleasure in
doing it.That flow ishow weloseourselves inanactivity and
become atpeace and content inourexperience. Different
people have flow indifferent activities. Thekeyistodiscover
what ourown particular passions areandcultivate them inour
lives. Wecanenjoy anexperience offlow andthatfeeling of
ajob well done, ofhard work completed, ofan
accomplishment well earned.
302

When asubstance orbehavior ofaddiction happens inthose
atrisk, then there isasurge indopamine that feels thrilling
andcompelling andgood andrewarding andsomething that
needs toberepeated, andrepeated soon. Not allofusmay
become addicted, but some ofuswill with exposure,
especially with early exposure. With theprecipitous drop
from thesurge’s peak, wehave arelative plummet inour
dopamine levels, andafter awhile thisdrop feels really bad.
We’ve gotten used tothedopamine thrill ofthepeak, and
we’ve become bored with thedopamine trough. And boring
becomes sodull andpainful incontrast tothesurging peak
thatweneed torepeat thedopamine surge-releasing behavior
soon, like very soon, like now. Given that theadolescent
trough isalready low, wecanseehow thisperiod oftime may
beespecially vulnerable todeveloping anaddiction tothe
surging dopamine peaks.
Research reveals, asmentioned earlier, thateven anticipating
and planning fortheactofingesting adrug captures our
intentions and focus ontheaddiction, and these mental
processes themselves release thedopamine surge. It’snotjust
thedrug’s ingestion. It’simagining thedrug andtheingestion
ofit.What thismeans isthat addiction isalife-consuming
challenge, notjustsomething wedobecause wearechoosing
it.Once asubstance becomes anaddiction and notjust an
experimentation wechoose todo,theaddiction isincharge.
Buteven ifwedon’t getaddicted toadrug, studies show that
chronic useofasubstance like alcohol, forexample, can
damage the liver and damage the brain.
When wethink ofKatey’s description ofherplanning, we
realize thattheexcitement andthethrill thatfeltcompelling
toKatey may have been more than simply adolescent
303

hyperrationality with dopamine-driven reward amplification.
Naturally, Katey isateen, andsothese elements were there.
But could itbethat this focus onalcohol was also further
amplifying thePROS ofherdopamine drive because shehad
inherited herfamily’s legacy ofaddiction, which included
alcoholism?
There isnospecific testforthatpossibility atthispoint, butI
brought itupwith Katey andwediscussed theissue, andwe
discussed herlack ofconcern about it.Allwecould doatthat
moment was raise her awareness about addiction asa
possibility beyond adolescent experimentation. And this
awareness wasexactly what shehadbeen missing before her
expulsion. That risk ofaddiction, like alltheother cons her
mind was minimizing, was just filed away asnot that
important even aswedidourwork attheendofhigh school.
Shecontinued todrink atparties during hersenior year. AllI
could dowas tohelp herbecome more andmore aware of
herself astheyear went on. Iwas intherole ofthe
non-parental adult who could support herduring thisperiod
ofher life, helping her get ready tocarry this new
self-awareness with herassheleftthesafe harbor ofher
home.
Katey wasdeveloping anew sense ofherself, onewith agreat
sense ofhumor, andonewith anunderstanding ofwho she
was and who she could become, even asher drinking
continued. Knowing that those reflections emerge from the
integrative prefrontal regions ofherbrain helped mefeelasif
wewere building theimportant skills ofself-awareness that
could continue to develop in the months ahead.
Just before shewent offtocollege, Katey was doing pretty
well and was ready tostop therapy. Atthat point shewas
304

aware that heruseofalcohol might become anissue inher
lifeandwhat itmight mean inthelong runifsheended up
being consumed byherdrinking. Isaw Katey periodically
during herfirst year ofcollege. Ittook several reminders in
thecourse ofheractive social life, with itsmany forays into
binge drinking during this freshman year, forKatey to
discover and admit toherself that shelikely had aserious
problem with alcohol abuse, and possibly even addiction.
When shetold meshewas having blackouts, thatshecould
notremember things that happened atparties when shehad
been drinking, and that shehad started drinking byherself
before shewent out,weboth knew itwas time toconsider a
different strategy for her life.
Katey isinthemidst oftrying tostop drinking, atleast for
now. I’ve told herthat research suggests working with a
twelve-step program, like Alcoholics Anonymous, would be
themost helpful andeffective way tosupport herefforts to
stay sober. But atthis point, shesays sheisreluctant to
participate in“something asridiculous asthat.” Even the
notion ofseeing alcohol asafood allergy, likesomething she
justshouldn’t eat,seemed “dumb.” Time will tellhow she’ll
hold out, and how she’ll letherbrain recover from the
continual dopamine-surging alcohol bath thatshe’s soaked it
inover this past year and ahalf since herexpulsion from
school. That’s abrain, Katey admitted tome, that’s gotten
“really used topartying hard.” That’s abrain, too,Itold her,
thatneeds abreak tothink clearly. We’ve talked toeach other
onand offover these lastfew months, and Katey told me
recently thatshefeels challenged bynotdrinking butistrying
tofind new ways offocusing hermind during parties and
when out with friends in other settings.
305

What Ireally needed tohave Katey learn isaway tofocus her
attention tointegrate herbrain andgive herthestrength to
calm hercravings and clear hermind. Those areskills she
should learn toincrease herself-awareness andreclaim her
life. Aswith Sara, I’ve encouraged Katey totake onthe
mindsight tools we’ve been learning here. We’ll seeifshe’s
open tostrengthening hermind andintegrating herlifefrom
theinside out.Butwith thisparticular challenge, ifshecould
also find support inagroup like Alcoholics Anonymous, it
would begreat—if shewould justgo.Let’s keep ourhopes up
thatshe’ll beopen tothese known ways toimprove herlife.
Iknow herparents aretrying their best tosupport her,butwe
allknow that atthis point itisuptoKatey totake the
initiative to empower her life.
Returning Home: Reflection, Realignment, and Repairing
Ruptures
Moving out ofthehouse isachange and challenge, a
powerful transition foradolescent and adult alike. After
moving away, many adolescents findthemselves coming back
home forextended periods oftime before they establish their
own financially independent lives. IntheUnited States in
recent times, one-third toone-half of“grown children” move
back inwith their parents. This trend isinfluenced byour
stressful financial times, soliving athome saves money. But
thistrend also hasitsemotional side, inwhich parents andthe
parental home provide needed support during thisperiod of
stressful transition and employment uncertainty. The
emotional impact ofolder adolescents’ returning home needs
tobeaddressed directly andreflected upon internally forthis
period of time to go well for all concerned.
306

This returning home hasitsown challenges forallofus.
Whichever side ofthegenerational divide you may find
yourself onnow, Iinvite youtotryapplying your mindsight
skills tounderstanding theexperience ofboth theadult and
the adolescent in the following story.
“Ifyoudon’t liketherules ofthehouse, youcangooutand
find ajob, earn some money, and move into your own
apartment.”
How many times have these words been saidfrom afrustrated
parent toanassertive adolescent? When things arrive atthis
point inarelationship between aparent and anolder
adolescent, itdoesn’t feelgood foranyone. Iknow because I
said these very words tomyson inamoment ofintense
frustration andirritation. Mysaying them washeavy-handed,
andasthey came outofmymouth Ialready feltbadinmy
heart. Mysonhadjustgraduated from college. He,likemany
hisage, hadcome back home following hisfour years away.
Hisplans were uncertain: Hemight bewith usforjustafew
months over thecourse ofthesummer and then start his
career inSouthern California, orhemight move back upto
Northern California where he’d gone tocollege andstart his
work there. Wehadallbeen getting along very well, having
meals together, going forwalks, watching television, going to
concerts. Itwas, insomany ways, quite wonderful. But a
number oftimes when mywife andIcame home, theplace
was abitofamess. Itwas probably cleaner than his
cooperative housing atschool, butforus,itwasamess. Pots
from morning breakfast were still onthestove, unmoved.
Plates filled with food were strewn around thecounter; pieces
ofvegetables andother reminders ofearlier meals layonthe
floor.
307

Inallhonesty, theplace wascleaner than when Iwasthere on
myown, when mywife was traveling andIwas abachelor
“empty nester,” with ourdaughter away forherfirst year of
college. Butwhen Icame infrom walking thedogs andheard
mysonsaytohismom thatitwasn’t abigdeal tohave some
plates around, I immediately felt frustrated.
Ihadlearned long agothat lifegoes well inourhousehold
when ourcleanliness standards were based onthe“highest”
expectation ofeach individual sharing the space. My
standards arequite low, I’lladmit, andmywife’s arehigh.
And we’ve worked outthattension, orcontinue totrytowork
itout, inaway that Ithink works well forusinour
partnership inlife. Sowhen oursonwas, inmyview, talking
back tomylifepartner, Ifound myself getting protective of
her.Atwenty-two-year-old male back athome canbelikea
young wolf returning tothepack he’d left,andmyalpha male
wolf hackles were raised when this young wolf was
“threatening” the alpha female ofour den. That’s the
backstory happening deep inmy limbic-thumb and
brainstem-palm areas. Inmycortex-fingers Isaid tomyself,
“Don’t gang uponhim—she canstate forherself thecase for
needing him toclean upafter himself. Don’t double upon
him!”
However, that very morning mywife had given oursona
polite butclear talk about ourstandards ofclean andasked
himtorespect those values. Sowhen we’d come home after a
night outandfound stuff stillaround from themorning, itwas
frustrating. Before I’dlefttowalk thedogs, mywife andI
sawthemess andreflected with each other onwhat itwaslike
tohave acollege graduate back athome, about how we’d
have towork outsome new rules, some new ways ofall
308

getting along after hisyears ofliving without ouroversight.
Mysonandhisfriends must have come inwhile Iwas out
with thedogs. Mywife andIhadagreed earlier nottojust
blurt outdemands buttotake amore sensitive approach with
ourson. Atthatmoment asIstood inthekitchen, itwaslike
saying tomyself “Don’t think ofapink elephant” andbeing
able tothink only ofthat pink elephant. When thebrain is
given instructions tobesure nottodosomething, itkeeps on
checking thatthing tokeep an“eye” onit.That tracking just
primes thething, making itmore likely tobeactivated. Soout
ofmymouth came some words Ishouldn’t have said about
hisneeding toclean up,andthen when hesaid thatitwasnot
really abigdeal toleave afew cups and plates around, I
became frustrated. “Look,” Itold him, “you areback from
college andthiscanhappen. You’ve been living onyour own,
andwith your own rules. And wehave ourown standards. So
understandably you may seethings differently than wedo.
Buthere’s thedeal: This isourhouse, notyours. And these
areourrules. Ifyouwant tolivehere, you’ll need torespect
ourrequests.” And then Isaid those words about hisgetting
his own apartment.
Now, youmay bethinking thatallthissounds fine. Ifyouare
anadult reading this you may feel that way, butasan
adolescent reading thisyoumay not.Idon’t know. ButIfelt
terrible right away. That evening Ifeltheavy anddrained and
irritated with myself. Itwasn’t somuch about theissue of
rules andcleanliness, itwastheproclamation thatthiswasnot
hishome. That was justplain insensitive andover thetop.It
was just wrong. The economy istough, unemployment is
high, college graduates abound, heworks hard, andthefactis,
thisishishome, too. The next morning andthroughout the
dayatwork, Icouldn’t stop thinking about what was really
309

going oninside methatgotmetosaythepart about thisnot
being his home. Why had I gotten so mad sofast?
When Icame home from work that next day, mysonandI
hadabigdiscussion about what itwas liketobeathisstage
oflife,twenty-two years oldandtransitioning from college to
working life, about going from being akidathome toan
adult in the world.
Iapologized forwhat Ihadsaid: “This isinfactyour home. I
amsorry forwhat Isaid. Yes, you need tokeep theplace
clean, butIwasoutoflinetotellyoutogooutandgetyour
own apartment. You may want todothat inthefuture, but
youhave justgraduated after four long hardworking years at
school, and Ishouldn’t have said something soharsh.” He
thanked mefortheapology, andsaid thathefeltthatIwas
probably irritated by something else going on in my own life.
That’s mindsight inaction. He was right ...and that
something else iswhat Ineeded toreflect upon. Our
experiences with our attachment figures, our parents, can
affect useven asweareparents ourselves. Making sense of
those experiences helps usbecome more present, more
self-aware, andbetter able toconnect with others. Ihadto
reflect onmyown internal meanings ofthisperiod oflifeso
thatIcould remain present with him asweallmoved along
on this life journey.
This brief story brings upanumber ofissues attheheart of
adolescence and lifeingeneral. One isthat sometimes as
parents wedothings that create arupture inaclose
connection. Itisourduty toreflect onsuch ruptures andmake
the efforts tomake arepair, toreconnect after we’ve
apologized forourcontribution toconflict. Asecond lesson is
310

thatsometimes wedothings thatwedon’t really want todo.
The brain hasthehigher, prefrontal part that helps usbe
aware ofthings and creates conscious intentions. But
sometimes thelower limbic, brainstem, and bodily areas
directly influence ourbehaviors, motivating ouractions and
filling them with feelings that shape ournon-verbal tone of
voice, timings, andfacial expressions without theintervening
prefrontal inhibition or filtering.
Inthis case, theoutput ofmyusing words with him was
pretty mild, butsometimes, aswe’ve seen, wecanflipour
lidsandgodown thelowroad with more force. Insome of
myother books (inMindsight ,thechapter “Crepes ofWrath,”
andinParenting from theInside Out,thesection ontheLow
Road), theimportance ofrupture and repair isexplored in
detail regarding younger kids, including myown. Somyson
hasgrown upknowing thatifthere isarupture, there ought to
bearepair. That’s how wecanacknowledge thatthere isno
such thing asaperfect way ofbehaving inarelationship,
which issimply themindsightful way ofrecognizing when a
rupture hasoccurred andmaking efforts toreconnect inthe
repair. Butletmesayhere thatbeing reflective isessential to
repair ruptures with those wecare about atanyage. We’ve
practiced repair intheMindsight Tools #3,and making a
reconnection iscrucial atanyage. During adolescence, itisa
central theme ofthis period tomaintain open lines of
communication, especially when theinevitable ruptures in
that connection occur. The changes and challenges ofthis
period make itimperative that we work onour own
self-understanding asparents andwork onrepairing ruptures
when they inevitably occur. Ihadtoexamine myprotective
stance toward mywife inresponse towhat oursonwasdoing.
And Ihadtoreflect onwhat went onathome when Iwasan
311

older adolescent, too. So looking upon ruptures as
opportunities toreflect internally and then connect
interpersonally again, tocreate integration when integration is
broken, isahelpful inner stance totake. Myhope wasthatmy
son would beable toforgive me, and toexperience my
apology asanexample ofhow torespond intheface of
conflict.
Since thisexperience, ourconnection hasbeen really strong.
Mindsight gives ustheway tobeopen toourinner lives and
maintain anempathic connection with those wecare about.
Even when ouroutward behaviors make arupture inour
communication, mindsight canguide usback toconnection. It
isthrough thefullspectrum ofthese mindsight moments that
our relationships can truly be integrative, honoring
differences andcultivating compassionate connections. Ilove
theways mysonandIcancommunicate with each other now
ashemoves through his later adolescent years; our
connection grows deeper andstronger theolder hebecomes.
Having thenotion ofstaying present through these many
changes inhislifeandthechallenges that they have raised
hasbeen aguiding principle forusall.Using thepower of
mindsight’s reflective conversations alsogives usabasic tool,
anessential way toconnect around things thatreally matter,
thatmakes theway werelate toeach other have adeep and
authentic quality andmakes these challenging moments truly
opportunities to deepen our connections with one another.

MINDSIGHT TOOLS #4
The Mindsight Simple Seven
Inthis tools section, I’dlike tointroduce you toseven
activities you candoonadaily basis that arescientifically
proven tokeep your body healthy, your mind strong, andyour
brain continuing togrow inintegrative ways throughout your
life.Research intothebrain’s ability tochange anddevelop in
response to experience, what is referred to as
“neuroplasticity,” reveals that regular practice ofthese
activities canactivate thegrowth ofneural connections, and
even new neurons. Asyoumay have noticed bynow, Iliketo
enlist acronyms tohelp readers (and myself!) remember
important concepts with regard tohow our brains and
emotional worlds work. Inthis spirit, Ioffer here
SNAG— stimulate neuronal activation andgrowth .Scientific
investigations have shown that when wedothe seven
activities thatfollow, weSNAG thebrain toward growth, and
thatgrowth isoften inthedirection ofintegration. Iputthese
seven processes inavisual image with acolleague, David
Rock, atthetime theUnited States Department ofAgriculture
wasputting outanew setofsuggestions intheform ofafood
plate revealing what were the recommended daily food
groups tokeep thebody healthy. David andIthought itmight
beuseful tomake thesame kind ofplate forthemind, which
wecall“The Healthy Mind Platter,” asetofseven activities
that promote optimal brain matter.
313

MINDSIGHT PRACTICE A: Time-In
You’ll seethat these seven include time-in, which we’ve
explored indepth inMindsight Tools #2.Time-in ishow we
reflect ontheinner nature ofourmental lives andourbodily
sensations. Itenables ustoperceive ourfeelings, thoughts,
memories, and beliefs, and ourintentions, hopes, dreams,
attitudes, andlongings. Time-in practiced onaregular basis
hasbeen shown tostimulate thegrowth ofmany fibers inthe
brain, especially the integrative ones that help regulate
attention, emotion, and thinking. Italso improves empathy
and compassion.
Taking time-in means reflecting onyour inner world. A
simple way todothisistoSIFT themind, paying attention to
your sensations, images, feelings, andthoughts. You cango
tomywebsite, DrDanSiegel.com, and explore thebreath
awareness practice forasimple mindfulness exercise. And if
after strengthening your ability tofocus your attention fora
few weeks, you are ready forsomething alittle more
314

comprehensive thatintegrates your consciousness, tryoutthe
Wheel ofAwareness practice, too.These areallvarious ways
ofgiving yourself atime-in thatsupports thegrowth ofyour
brain andthewell-being ofyour mind. It’snotbadforyour
relationships, either!
315

Amazingly, the mindful awareness of time-in that
supports your being present forwhatever arises inyour life
also helps toincrease your levels oftheenzyme telomerase,
which repairs andmaintains theends ofyour chromosomes
316

thathelp keep your individual cells alive andhealthy. That’s
notajoke—taking time-in makes your cells healthier! In
addition, your immune system willfunction better andyou’ll
have more energy, andeven develop amore resilient way of
approaching life’s challenges because ofspecific ways your
brain will change. Not bad forasimple daily practice of
taking time-in and reflecting on the inner world!
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE B: Sleep Time
Another daily activity that hasbeen shown toincrease the
way your brain continues togrow inanintegrative way isthe
time you sleep. Inourmodern times, digital displays and
electrical lights keep usstimulated andawake long after we’d
naturally befalling asleep. Since thetime weneed towake up
inthemorning does notchange much, thismeans thatwewill
begetting less sleep than wemay need foroptimal brain
growth. When you add tothat thereality that theteenage
brain’s cycle ofwaking and sleeping isonadifferent
schedule than adults orchildren, with staying uplater being a
natural outcome formany adolescents, theearly time of
school makes this setup achronic source ofnotgetting
enough sleep.
Think ofthefollowing amounts asaballpark starting point
forthinking about your own sleep hygiene. According tothe
United States National Sleep Foundation, most teens need
about eight andahalf tonine andaquarter hours andmost
adults need seven tonine hours ofsleep each night. When I
write theword need ,what Imean isthat foroptimal brain
growth, foroptimal memory consolidation ofthe day’s
learning, foroptimal insulin function andfood metabolism to
keep fit,foroptimal immune function tofight offdisease, for
optimal response tostress todeal with life’s hassles, andfor
317

optimal mental functioning with effective abilities for
focusing attention, thinking, remembering, problem solving,
handling your emotions, and connecting with others in
relationships, you need atleast thelesser amount ofyour
range ofsleep. How much uninterrupted sleep anight areyou
getting?
Without adequate sleep, each ofthese important neural,
physiological, and mental processes isinjeopardy ofnot
functioning well. What’s theoutcome ofinadequate amounts
andquality ofsleep? Thebrain doesn’t grow well, memory is
notconsolidated andyoudon’t remember what youlearned,
insulin doesn’t work right andbecoming overweight ismore
likely, stress hormones riseandmake youfeellousy, immune
functions don’t work well andyoucangetsick more easily,
and your mind won’t beassharp forpaying attention,
thinking, andproblem solving. Plus youmay simply have less
energy, feel bad, become irritable more easily, and get
frustrated with others more frequently. Inshort, you can
become moody and notmuch funtobearound. You may
come tofeeloutofsorts andnoteven realize thatthisstate of
being is because of your sleep habits.
The great news is that you are in control of your sleeping.
Here isalistofsimple daily sleep habits youcanpractice that
will help you get enough sleep soundly throughout the night:
1.Turn offdigital objects andelectronic screens atleast
an hour before you go to bed. These
objects—computers, smartphones, televisions—keep
your brain thinking it should be wide awake.
318

2.Ifyouhave trouble falling asleep, tryturning down the
lights a bit in the half-hour before you get into bed.
3.Try nottodowork orhomework inbed. The bed
should beforrestful activities, notassociated with
working.
4.Bemindful thatcaffeine insoda, coffee, orteacankeep
some people upatnight. This also includes chocolate,
unfortunately. Sowatch when youdrink andeatthese
substances, andmake sure you arenotconsuming too
much overall ortoolateinthedayforyoutoeasily fall
asleep and maintain sleep through the night.
5.Some people like totake awarm bath before bed.
Others like todrink aglass ofmilk orsome other
beverage containing calcium, which can help you sleep.
6.Some liketowrite outtheday’s events inajournal so
that they arenotworried about things when they fall
asleep. Ifthatworks foryou, great! Keep inmind that
journal writing hasbeen shown toimprove theimmune
system, andithelps resolve challenging issues inyour
life. Others find journal writing right before bed too
stimulating. Naturally thisistrue ifyou arekeeping a
digital journal onaback-lit screen, sotryusing apaper
journal for evening reflections. See what works for you.
7.Theamount ofcontinuous sleep yougetmatters. Soset
uptheevening accordingly, keeping inmind when you
need togetupthenext morning. Eight tonine hours isa
range toaim for.Seewhat your natural needs are,no
319

matter your age. Over aweek’s time, give yourself
plenty of time to sleep.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE C: Focus Time
The brain grows notonly when wesleep butalso when we
focus ourattention inacontinuous way without frequent
distractions. Infact, learning istheway ourattention streams
energy through ourbrain’s circuits, creating information in
certain areas that become activated, and then linking those
activated neurons with brain growth. That’s neuroplasticity,
how thebrain changes inresponse toexperience. Thebrain is
built tofocus ononething atatime, processing itinto more
elaborated forms, connecting ittosimilar items, linking itto
others, and then consolidating alloftheneural firing into
long-term structural changes.
Focus time refers tothose periods oftime when wefocus
intently onone thing atatime. Unlike when weare
multitasking, such asreading abook while texting orsurfing
theWeb while speaking onthephone, focus time means
doing only one thing at a time.
320

When wefocus intensely, wedothree things inthebrain. One
isthat thepart ofthebrain just above thebrainstem-palm
secretes animportant chemical, acetylcholine, throughout the
brain. Asecond thing isthatpaying close attention intensely
activates specific circuits. When neurons firetogether, they
wire together. And thisbrings ustothethird: When wepay
close attention toonething, theacetylcholine bathing those
activating circuits works with thelocalized release ofanother
neurochemical, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, orBDNF,
tooptimize how genes become expressed toproduce the
proteins necessary tostrengthen theconnections among those
firing neurons. Inshort, when you payclose attention, you
optimize neuroplastic changes that are the basis for learning.
Iknow ofadolescents who saythey arehaving trouble with
schoolwork. They cannot remember, they tellme,what they
read orwhat they studied. And, indeed, allofthehomework
and studying they aredoing just doesn’t seem tohave a
lasting impact ontheir testperformance. When Iaskhow they
study, they reveal thatthey areoften involved inmultitasking.
Sowhat happens isthat theperson sitswith abook buther
attention isconstantly being divided. This division of
attention toward non-school material, intheform ofchatting,
texting, blogging, andWeb surfing, continually disrupts the
neuroplastic conditions necessary tomake those studies turn
into synaptic change inthe brain. Without the lasting
structural changes inthebrain, nolong-term learning can
321

occur. The exam comes and goes, just like thedivided
attention that prevented any synapse growth from occurring.
These digitally enhanced disruptions topaying close attention
compromise long-term learning forboth adolescents and
adults. Infact, many adults who arenotinvolved insome
lifelong learning program, like book clubs ordiscussion
groups oradult educational courses, have aserious potential
problem. Ifwedon’t have focus time onaregular basis, our
brains stop doing what they were born todo—continue to
learn and grow and make new connections throughout our
lives. Adults without theprojects thatenable them toclosely
pay attention tosomething can begin tofeel like lifehas
become arut, unchanging, and boring. Lifelong learning
should beseen asanopportunity tokeep challenged, tokeep
the brain growing, and to keep ourselves engaged in learning.
Sadly, school formany ofusbecomes aburden, not a
pleasure. The emphasis on competition instead of
collaboration, on achievement rather than creative
exploration, makes many ofusturn offtothelearning
experience. Focus time reminds usthatweneed tokeep our
minds well honed and tokeep onlearning throughout our
lives.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE D: Downtime
While focusing attention inanuninterrupted manner helps the
brain grow, youmay also berelieved toknow thatwedon’t
need todothatallthetime. Infact, giving yourself abreak
andvarying what you doisthewhole idea ofthese simple
seven daily mind activities. Every day wecanhave some
downtime toenable ourminds tounwind andourbrains to
sort themselves out. Downtime iswhen wehave noplans,
322

nothing wearetrying toaccomplish, nothing thatneeds tobe
done. During this period thebrain seems torecharge its
batteries, allowing the mind to intentionally be given a break.
Downtime isquite different from unintentional mind
wandering. Ifthetask athand istofocus onsomething, likea
conversation with someone oranassignment ortalkatschool,
letting ourminds wander offtask without thechoice todo
thatcanbepretty disruptive towhat we’re trying toachieve.
Some studies even suggest it’snotgood forourhealth and
happiness.
Instead, downtime means thatwedesignate atime tojustchill
out, tohave nothing onthecalendar, toletourimaginations
gowherever they will. Vacations areagreat time tojusthang
out.Butonadaily basis, it’salso good tosetaside some time
totake abrain break, torelax and unwind. Give yourself
permission todothis intentionally. That’s the goal of
downtime, when weintentionally have nosetgoal. Sounds
ironic, Iknow, butresearch reveals thatit’sreally important,
even in limited amounts, each day.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE E: Playtime
The term “play” may make you think ofchildhood
experiences ontheplayground, butwe’re discovering that
participating inthespontaneous exploration oflifewith others
inengaging, pleasurable, andnon-judgmental ways isactually
crucial forahealthy and fulfilling lifethroughout ourlife
span. Laughing isaserious matter when itcomes tobrain
matter. When wearespontaneous andhaving fun, thebrain
grows. It’sasgood foradolescents asitisfortheadults who
lessfrequently engage inplay orjusthanging outorgoofing
around. Giving ourselves thetime and thepermission to
323

engage inactivities, byourselves andwith others, where we
aresimply creating new andunexpected ways ofbeing—in
how wefeel, inthings wesayandthings wedo,inways we
interact with others—is great toletthemind feel free and
accepted forwhatever itcomes upwith. Italso letsthebrain
become active innew andunpredictable ways thataregood
forittogrow andsolidify new connections. That’s thebasis
ofcreativity andinnovation. That’s thepleasure ofpresence
and connection.
Sadly, kids inschool arescheduled formostly goal-directed
activities inwhich they arebeing judged and evaluated,
compared with others, andasked tocompete andbeat their
rivals. Whether it’sinthecontrolled setting ofadidactic
lesson orexam inaclassroom, orbeing onateam onthe
athletic field, those structured times arenotwhat wemean by
playtime. Instead, imagine aninteraction where there isno
winner, aninteractive activity where there arenorigid rules, a
time when laughing and creating and goofing around are
accepted andpeople areengaged andsilly andhaving agreat
time, without judgment, without awinner orloser. That’s
playtime.
324

Playtime
Sadly, adults often forget how toplay. Thesocial engagement
system ofthebrain, asetofcircuits that make learning
facilitated andfun, becomes rusty andoutofshape andcan
shut down. Activities become routine, and thespontaneous
exploration oflifeandtheworld becomes athing ofthelong
distant past. Infact, thekind ofcreative thinking thatemerges
with such open and accepting engagement decreases
dramatically once we get into elementary school. That
divergent thinking enables usto“think outside thebox”
because weseelifewith fresh eyes andarenotworried about
being punished orembarrassed for getting something
325

wrong—because there issharing andexploration, notcontrol
and humiliation. Ayoung child inpreschool will befilled
with curiosity about lifeandtheworld. Butonce that child
gets toelementary school, thestandard approach istosaythat
there isaright orawrong, andifyoustudy well, you’ll get
theright answer onthetestorbook report oressay orlab
assignment. Nothing iswrong with learning tospell well. But
wedon’t need toshut our spontaneity into little boxes,
imprisoned intheroutine ofstudies andtests andstudies and
tests. Creativity isoften outtheelementary window, andthe
restofourschool experience toofrequently becomes filled
with anon-playful seriousness thatcankillspontaneity. And
itcanstifle thecourage tobecreative, totake achance and
imagine something new. That’s partofwhy people cancome
tofeel that school lifeisoppressive anduninspiring. When
that’s notthecase, teachers often may have found away to
instill the spirit of play in the daily life of the classroom.
When Icame torealize that asanadult playtime was nota
partofmylife,Isigned upforanimprovisational acting class
fornon-actors tojoin with others injust cracking upand
having agood time. Ilove it.And though itisonly once a
week, Itrytobring thejoyofthatexperience into mydaily
life. Ialso started roller blading around theneighborhood on
myown, listening tomusic androlling androcking down the
street. The oddthing formewas thatnotonly didIhave to
give myself permission tohave fun,butfortheserious partof
my adult mind, Ihad toconvince myself that itwas
actually good formybrain toletmyself goof off. It’s a
win-win situation—my brain grows and I have a good time.
Playtime corrects theusual seriousness trend ofschool and
adult life, giving usadaily time forbeing spontaneous
326

andcreative, feeling accepted andconnected, alive andjoyful,
and having a whole lot of laughter and fun.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE F: Physical Time
Moving your body grows your brain.
Aerobic movement thatinvolves getting your heart rateupfor
over thirty minutes, preferably closer toforty-five, isagreat
start. Lifting weights ordoing other activities thatstrengthen
muscles with, forinstance, stretch bands also supports how
our brains function.
Intheschool district where Ilive, thelossofschool funds and
theemphasis onpure academic achievement ledtophysical
education being disbanded and recess time forkids being
shortened. Ontopofthose changes, artandmusic anddrama
anddance were cutdown aswell. Something isoffinthese
priorities, especially when you simply look atthis from a
brain perspective. Art and music and drama and dance
support thecreative explorations thatplaytime facilitates. And
physical activity supports allourlearning. When wemove our
bodies, neuroplasticity isenhanced. Weremember more, we
grow more connections inthebrain, and wesolidify those
connections. Moving thebody iscrucial fornotonly brain
health butalso mental health. Aerobic exercise enhances our
mood even ifweareprone tobecoming depressed. Iknow
many afriend whose moodiness was evened out when
exercise became a daily part of their lives.
Foradults and foradolescents, physical time, ifmedically
possible, isanimportant part ofyour daily brain andmind
health. Ask your doctor how intense you canbewith your
physical activity ifthere areanymedical issues thatmay limit
your movements. Working upasweat can begreat, and
327

finding variation inwhat youdocanbeessential increating
fitness andavoiding injuries. The keyistowarm up,stretch,
work out, stretch, and cool down.
Remember thatdaily movement ofyour body isyour choice.
Noone can make you doitbutyou. But it’sawin-win
situation. You’ll feelbetter, your brain will grow better, and
you’ll become more fitand healthy. Not bad foradaily
workout.
MINDSIGHT PRACTICE G: Connecting Time
Numerous research studies reveal that theway weconnect
with others makes ourlives more meaningful, healthy, wise,
and happy. InMindsight Tools #3, we explored how
time-between and reflective conversations help usconnect
with others insupportive ways that aremutually rewarding.
When wehave supportive relationships, wearenotonly
happier, wearehealthier andlivelonger! Other studies show
that when weareoutinnature, wefeel more grounded and
ourmoods aremore stable. Soconnecting time iswhen we
connect to other people and the planet.
Itrytoremember thequalities ofconnecting time with the
strange term “3G-2P.” Iknow thatisn’t somemorable, butat
least ithasthecore features ofthisimportant daily practice.
3Gstands forthegratitude wehave forbeing alive onthis
precious planet, thegenerosity wecan bring toothers in
connecting with them, andthegiving back (orgifting back)
wecanpractice each dayasweserve thewell-being ofothers.
And the2P? You may have guessed. We bring gratitude,
generosity, and giving back to other people and to the planet.
People andtheplanet. When weconnect with other people in
these positive ways, when wewish others tobehappy, tobe
328

successful atwhat they do,tohave joyand health intheir
lives, we bring acompassionate stance that supports
something called “empathic joy”—getting joyfrom another’s
well-being. Iknow thatsounds quite different from theusual
competitive environment that modern society cultivates. But
just tryitoutand Ithink you’ll seethat it’sawin-win
situation again. Studies ofhow wefunction aspeople reveal
that wearebuilt tocollaborate with oneanother. When we
work together inthese supportive ways, the collective
intelligence created ismuch more powerful than thesolo
person trying to beat out others.
Onasimple level, connecting time means taking time tobe
with friends orfamily, hopefully face-to-face. Thesignals we
getfrom others thatarenon-verbal, likeeyecontact andfacial
expressions, tone ofvoice, posture, gestures, timing and
intensity ofresponses, and thehuman actoffriendly and
appropriate touch, areunavoidably missing inour digital
means ofcommunicating. Ifwemostly communicate with
others viatexting ordigital chatting, there isawhole lotof
important brain realestate notbeing engaged. Ifyoucan, try
tomake adaily practice ofconnecting time inperson sothat
you engage your friends face-to-face when possible.
And theplanet? How wetake time tobeinnature canshape
ourmood, help usfocus attention, andgive usafeeling of
renewal andpleasure. Ifyouliveinacity, itmay seem hard
togetoutinnature onadaily basis. Butgetting toapark or
looking outattrees andclouds andtheskyandmoon isa
good start. We come from theplanet, and nature isour
original home. Connecting with theplanet can also mean
doing more than simply being innature, itcanmean taking
care ofourenvironment. Picking uplitter when weseeit,and
329

notlittering ourselves, isagreat start. Finding ways toavoid
waste byrecycling and being mindful about how weuse
energy canallbeimportant ways each ofuscanconnect to
our common home, this planet Earth.
Connecting time canhelp usfeelthetruth thatwebelong toa
larger whole than thebody welivein.Wemay walk with our
own twofeetonthisplanet, butwearenotalone. TheEarth is
ourcommon home, other people ourtribe, and allliving
beings our relatives.
330

CONCLUSION
MWe and the Integration of Identity
We have come along way inour conversation about
adolescence. Icannot know how you arefeeling about this
exploration coming toaclose soon, butImyself amfeeling
sad it’s ending yet exhilarated by the territory we’ve covered.
Ouradolescence isatime ofgreat integration—integration of
themany aspects ofourselves. During thisimportant period in
ourlives, thesecond dozen years, weexplore thevery nature
ofwho we are. And aswe weave the essence of
adolescence—the emotional spark, the intense social
engagement, the novelty seeking, and the drive toward
creative exploration—into who wearebecoming, weare
undergoing afundamental lifeprocess thatdoes not, byany
means, endwhen wearetwenty-four. Integration ofidentity
isalifelong journey ofdefining what hasmeaning inyour life
now and for all the years to come.
Some time agoIbegan tothink about thegreat human need
wearefacing atthismoment inourhistory tomove ourfocus
from “me” to“we.” Ibelieve thatasinhabitants ofthisplanet
theworld needs ustostop being soself-involved and to
instead transform inaway thatisgiving back, orgifting back,
totheplanet. Ibelieve itisourduty tohelp other people and
toprotect theEarth. Interestingly, numerous studies support
this idea that themore wehelp others, thehealthier and
happier we ourselves become.
Atalecture Igave onthissubject, oneofmyseminar students
became quite upset with thisnotion of“me towe.” Shesaid
shewas working hard onthevarious aspects ofherpersonal
331

integration, like finding away tomake sense ofher
attachment history and create both integration ofher
memories and acoherent narrative ofher early life
experiences. Shesaidthatshedidn’t want togive upfinding a
way ofmaking sense ofherindividual lifeandinstead focus
ona“we.” Ilistened closely toherconcerns, andrealized that
thephrase “me towe” might imply something more extreme
than what wasintended. SoIsuggested toherthatthisnotion
wasmore likemoving “from only metoalsowe.” While such
aphrase may notrhyme sowell, atleast itembraced the
integration intended atitscore, onethat could embrace the
importance ofourindividual, personal lifeaswell asour
interdependent, connected life.
Still, Istarted wondering how thisidea ofabodily-defined
self, a“me,” opening itself uptoandbecoming apart ofa
larger selfbeyond, a“we,” might bedescribed inoneword. I
offered this young woman thefollowing term, which I’ll
share with you as well:
MWe.
332

This isaterm Ihave come tousetosuccinctly describe the
integration ofidentity. Itembraces thenotion ofbreathing
across ourindividualized, bodily defined selfandlinking all
ofustogether asmembers ofalarger whole, awe-defined
self. MWe asaword itself, andasaconcept, isdefined byme
and we, sowe don’t need togive upthe important
differentiation ofapersonal selfandofaninterconnected self.
Each isdifferent, each isimportant. Linking them together in
our lives isakey that may help inour journey toward
theintegration of identity.
But why do we need the notion of MWe in the world?
Studies show that themore individualized and isolated our
sense ofself is,theless happy and less healthy we’ll be.
333

When wedefine a“self ”aslimited totheboundaries ofour
skin-encased bodies, welimit oursense ofbelonging and
meaning inlife. Yetsomuch inourmodern culture, onthe
Internet, inourbusy contemporary lives, reinforces thisview
thattheselfisabodily defined aspect ofwho weare.Studies
reveal clearly that when weareinsupportive relationships
and engage inhelping others, wearehappier and weare
healthier. Even research onpeople who aregiven money
demonstrates thatthey will have more long-lasting happiness
when they use that money tobenefit others rather than
keeping it all for themselves.
Embracing MWe also means that weexperience thesense
thatweareapartofalarger whole, apartofalarger purpose
inlifethan just ourown personal journey. MWe embraces
notions ofspirituality andthat there isadeeper meaning to
lifedirectly. Butitisimportant tonote thatbeing connected
tosomething larger than ourselves does notmean that we
must discard ourprivate self. Wesimply need toexpand itto
include aninterconnected self aswell. That’s integration.
That’s MWe.
Another aspect ofMWe iscrucial tomention here. People
andourplanet areinapainful state ofneeding care. When we
look atthe increases inthe human population and the
challenges for healthy food, air, and water, and the
ever-increasing need formedicine, clothing, and shelter for
ourhuman family, and when werealize how other living
creatures aresuffering anddisappearing because ofwhat we
humans aredoing totheplanet, werealize thatthere arealot
of problems we need to try to collectively solve.
Adolescents have somuch tooffer ourworld inthisregard
with their drive andingenuity tofind new solutions tothese
334

important global problems. But todothis, younger people
need thesupport ofelders; they need tobehonored fortheir
emerging minds’ drive topush back and find creative
explorations thatmay justopen ourminds uptonew ways of
dealing with these challenging times.
Working creatively andcollaboratively intheir communities
andwith their families andschools, theemerging generation
will have the vision tomove away from the mere
memorization offacts andfigures tocreate more imaginative
and meaningful ways toinspire their generation and the
generations that follow. We will beable tocreate the
necessary changes forthis new erathrough education and
through theimportant role ofourfamily life, themessage of
adolescence then moving outinto ourcommunities andthe
larger society inwhich welive. There isplenty totackle, but
when wepitourwits against thecomplex problems ofglobal
hunger, disease, andviolence, pollution, climate change, and
theloss ofplants and animals inourecosystems, wewill
succeed. Bycollaborating rather than trying toonly surpass or
annihilate one another, wewill prevail asahuman society
living in an interconnected world.
335

When we bring our individual skills and passion and
knowledge forthe benefit ofthe larger whole, weare
maximizing ourchances ofsolving theworld’s practical and
moral problems. Isay“moral” here because itisamoral
imperative tofind away towork together tosolve our
collective challenges. Weshare thesame air,thesame water,
thesame home, ourplanet Earth. Agood planet ishard to
find, solet’s collectively take care ofthisonenow. Itistime
to find a new identity to face these crucial times together.
Asanadolescent these may seem like lofty ideas, Iknow.
They may even seem irrelevant. Isaythem aswegetready to
336

saygoodbye, because Ibelieve sodeeply thatourindividual
needs formeaning andbelonging inorder tofeelhappy and
fulfilled inlifecanactually besatisfied byexpanding theway
wedefine theself. This isawin-win situation. Developing
toward aMWe will make ushappier, and itwill give the
world afighting chance tobecome healthier aswell. Ibelieve
thattheworld’s challenges canmost effectively beaddressed
byhelping expand oursense ofidentity beyond aseparate
self.
Albert Einstein once said that thenotion ofanisolated self
was“anoptical delusion” thatleads toallsorts ofproblems in
theworld andinlife. Adelusion isafalse belief, aview that
isnotconsistent with reality. When weseeourselves as
separate, wearenotfacing thereality ofourinterdependent,
interconnected nature. We arenotintegrating ouridentity
with thelarger world thatwearefundamentally apart of.It
justmay bethatmany ofourbiggest challenges individually
andcollectively areinfactrevealed asthechaos andrigidity
ofsuch impaired integration, astate created byourhuman
sense ofaseparate selfthat assumes happiness comes from
material acquisitions alone and that infinite consumption is
possible on our resource-limited planet.
Integrating ouridentity reminds ustodifferentiate ourbodily
self and ourinterconnected self, and then tolink them. It
reminds usthatourminds emerge asmuch from ourbodies
and brains asfrom ourrelationships with one another and
with ourplanet. Why would anadolescent oranadult really
care about integrating identity? Forallofus,these second
dozen years oflife—whether weareinthem now orare
learning tohold ontotheir essence inourlives—carry the
core qualities that just may bewhat weneed tomove the
337

course ofourplanet’s health inapositive direction. The
integration ofMWe can draw upon the essence of
adolescence toharness theemotional spark thatfuels ourvital
sense ofbeing alive inourjourney oflife,notjustwhile we
areteenagers butthroughout ourlater adolescence andinto
ouradult years. We can harness thepower ofoursocial
engagements tobrainstorm ideas andfind deep, meaningful
connections thatsustain andenrich ourlives. With oursearch
fornovelty, wecanmake lifeanadventure thattransforms the
ordinary into theextraordinary, finding theunique aspects of
ourexperience within each day ofourlives. And with the
creative explorations thatinspire ourinquiring minds tothink
innew ways, perceive with new eyes, and innovate with
original contributions toourworld’s basic challenges, wecan
confront theproblems ahead with anew sense ofpotential,
purpose, andpossibility. Sothissmall word, MWe ,letsussee
thepower ofdifferentiation andlinkage. And itreminds usof
where wecangotogether asweencourage andexpand the
essence of adolescence throughout our lives.
E.B.White wrote: “Iftheworld were merely seductive, that
would beeasy. Ifitwere merely challenging, thatwould be
noproblem. ButIarise inthemorning torn between adesire
toimprove theworld andadesire toenjoy theworld. This
makes it hard to plan the day.”
Toimprove theworld isagreat intention, butifweseethatas
apressure to“save” the world, itcan become too
overwhelming, toodistant agoal. Instead, perhaps wecan
simply think ofserving theworld, ofhelping theplanet and
other people onerelationship andoneinteraction atatime.
Thepotential outcome ofimproving orsaving canbeabroad
intention, butcannot beguaranteed; theactofserving isa
338

goal wecangrasp, something wecanachieve. Theother urge
White feltisequally important. Weshould honor ourdesire to
create joyinlife,andwemust never stop savoring theworld.
And soperhaps away toembrace these two natural drives
side byside canbeourintegrated approach: Savor andserve .
Integrating ourlives isabout differentiating andlinking these
twogoals that, though inmany ways areseparate, contribute
toafull life ofenjoyment and connection, pleasure and
purpose. Wecanenjoy ourselves and one another; wecan
have funandexplore thislife, thisworld, these relationships.
And wecanfind ways tohelp others, toreduce suffering, to
heal ourplanet. Savor andserve. MWe canhelp usachieve
this balance.
The poet Maya Angelou, paraphrasing anold Chinese
proverb, reminds usthatwedon’t have towait tohave allthe
solutions before weexpress ourselves, before weparticipate
insharing thiscollective story ofourlives. “Abird doesn’t
sing because ithasananswer, itsings because ithasasong.”
Aswedevelop intoadolescence andbeyond, itistime forus
toconnect with oneanother, toshare oursongs oflife, aswe
move through this journey of MWe together.
How canweknow asadolescents ifwearesucceeding in
living ourlives fully? How canweknow asadults thatweare
successfully supporting the emerging minds ofthe new
generation well—and even carrying the essence of
adolescence forward inourown lives? Apoem byBessie
Anderson Stanley offers insights into what asuccessful
adolescence might look like, how theessence ofadolescence
can enrich the rest of our lives:
SUCCESS
339

To laugh often and love much;
Towintherespect ofintelligent persons andtheaffection of
children;
Toearn theapprobation ofhonest critics and endure the
betrayal of false friends;
To appreciate beauty;
To find the best in others;
To give of one’s self;
Toleave theworld abitbetter, whether byahealthy child, a
garden patch or a redeemed social condition;
Tohave played andlaughed with enthusiasm andsung with
exultation;
Toknow even onelifehasbreathed easier because youhave
lived—
This is to have succeeded.
Aswecome toourfinal moments together, Iwish foryouall
thevitality andauthenticity that adolescence offers tothose
stillinthisperiod oflifeandthose who have passed through it
buthave theopportunity fortherestoftheir lives toembrace
itsessence. May you besuccessful inletting theessence of
adolescence thrive throughout your life. May anemotional
spark fuel your life; may social engagement encourage
collective intelligence andcollaborative action; may thedrive
fornovelty letyouhold ontotheprivilege andthrill ofthis
adventure oflife; and may your creative explorations
empower youtoimagine andconstruct aworld oftomorrow
thatallofuswillbeproud toliveinforgenerations tocome. I
340

hope youwill find ways tosavor andtoserve, toshare your
life’s songs, andtointegrate yourselves innew andauthentic
ways in your life ahead. Enjoy!
