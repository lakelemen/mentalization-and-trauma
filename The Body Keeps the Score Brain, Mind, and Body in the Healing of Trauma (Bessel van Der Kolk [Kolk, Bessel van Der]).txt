Praise for The Body Keeps the Scor e
“This book is a tour de force. Its deeply empathic, insightful, and
compassionate perspective promises to further humanize the treatment of
trauma victims, dramatically expand their repertoire of self-regulatory
healing practices and therapeutic options, and also stimulate greater creative
thinking and research on trauma and its ef fective treatment. The body does
keep the score, and V an der Kolk’ s ability to demonstrate this through
compelling descriptions of the work of others, his own pioneering trajectory
and experience as the field evolved and him along with it, and above all, his
discovery of ways to work skillfully with people by bringing mindfulness to
the body (as well as to their thoughts and emotions) through yoga,
movement, and theater are a wonderful and welcome breath of fresh air and
possibility in the therapy world.”
—Jon Kabat-Zinn, professor of medicine emeritus, UMass Medical School;
author of Full Catastr ophe Living
“This exceptional book will be a classic of modern psychiatric thought. The
impact of overwhelming experience can only be truly understood when
many disparate domains of knowledge, such as neuroscience,
developmental psychopathology , and interpersonal neurobiology are
integrated, as this work uniquely does. There is no other volume in the field
of traumatic stress that has distilled these domains of science with such rich
historical and clinical perspectives, and arrived at such innovative treatment
approaches. The clarity of vision and breadth of wisdom of this unique but
highly accessible work is remarkable. This book is essential reading for
anyone interested in understanding and treating traumatic stress and the
scope of its impact on society .”
—Alexander McFarlane AO, MB BS (Hons) MD FRANZCP , director of the
Centre for T raumatic Stress Studies, The University of Adelaide, South
Australia.
“This is an amazing accomplishment from the neuroscientist most
responsible for the contemporary revolution in mental health toward the

recognition that so many mental problems are the product of trauma. W ith
the compelling writing of a good novelist, van der Kolk revisits his
fascinating journey of discovery that has challenged established wisdom in
psychiatry . Interspersed with that narrative are clear and understandable
descriptions of the neurobiology of trauma; explanations of the
inef fectiveness of traditional approaches to treating trauma; and
introductions to the approaches that take patients beneath their cognitive
minds to heal the parts of them that remained frozen in the past. All this is
illustrated vividly with dramatic case histories and substantiated with
convincing research. This is a watershed book that will be remembered as
tipping the scales within psychiatry and the culture at lar ge toward the
recognition of the toll traumatic events and our attempts to deny their
impact take on us all.”
—Richard Schwartz, originator , Internal Family Systems Therapy
“ The  Body Keeps the Scor e  is clear , fascinating, hard to put down, and filled
with powerful case histories. V an der Kolk, the eminent impresario of
trauma treatment, who has spent a career bringing together diverse trauma
scientists and clinicians and their ideas, while making his own pivotal
contributions, describes what is ar guably the most important series of
breakthroughs in mental health in the last thirty years. W e’ve known that
psychological trauma fragments the mind. Here we see not only how
psychological trauma also breaks connections within the brain, but also
between mind and  body , and learn about the exciting new approaches that
allow people with the severest forms of trauma to put all the parts back
together again.”
—Norman Doidge, author of The Brain That Changes Itself
“In The Body Keeps the Scor e  we share the author ’ s courageous journey
into the parallel dissociative worlds of trauma victims and the medical and
psychological disciplines that are meant to provide relief. In this compelling
book we learn that as our minds desperately try to leave trauma behind, our
bodies keep us trapped in the past with wordless emotions and feelings.
These inner disconnections cascade into ruptures in social relationships
with disastrous ef fects on marriages, families, and friendships. V an der
Kolk of fers hope by describing treatments and strategies that have

successfully helped his patients reconnect their thoughts with their bodies.
W e leave this shared journey understanding that only through fostering self-
awareness and gaining an inner sense of safety will we, as a species, fully
experience the richness of life.
—Stephen W . Por ges, PhD, professor of psychiatry , University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill; author of The Polyvagal Theory: Neur ophysiological
Foundations of Emotions, Attachment, Communication, and Self-Regulation
“Bessel van der Kolk is unequaled in his ability to synthesize the stunning
developments in the field of psychological trauma over the past few
decades. Thanks in part to his work, psychological trauma—ranging from
chronic child abuse and neglect, to war trauma and natural disasters—is
now generally recognized as a major cause of individual, social, and
cultural breakdown. In this masterfully lucid and engaging tour de force,
V an der Kolk takes us—both specialists and the general public— on his
personal journey and shows what he has learned from his research, from his
colleagues and students, and, most important, from his patients. The Body
Keeps the Scor e  is, simply put, brilliant.”
—Onno van der Hart, PhD, Utrecht University , The Netherlands; senior author ,
The Haunted Self: Structural Dissociation and the T r eatment of Chr onic
T raumatization
“ The Body Keeps the Scor e  articulates new and better therapies for toxic
stress based on a deep understanding of the ef fects of trauma on brain
development and attachment systems. This volume provides a moving
summary of what is currently known about the ef fects of trauma on
individuals and societies, and introduces the healing potential of both age-
old and novel approaches to help traumatized children and adults fully
engage in the present.”
—Jessica Stern, policy consultant on terrorism; author of Denial: A Memoir of
T err or
“A book about understanding the impact of trauma by one of the true
pioneers in the field. It is a rare book that integrates cutting edge
neuroscience with wisdom and understanding about the experience and
meaning of trauma, for people who have suf fered from it. Like its author ,
this book is wise and compassionate, occasionally quite provocative, and
always interesting.”

—Glenn N. Saxe, MD, Arnold Simon Professor and chairman, Department of
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; director , NYU Child Study Center , New Y ork
University School of Medicine.
“A fascinating exploration of a wide range of therapeutic treatments shows
readers how to take char ge of the healing process, gain a sense of safety ,
and find their way out of the morass of suf fering.”
—Francine Shapiro, PhD, originator of EMDR therapy; senior research fellow ,
Emeritus Mental Research Institute; author of Getting Past Y our Past
“As an attachment researcher I know that infants are psychobiological
beings. They are as much of the body as they are of the brain. W ithout
language or symbols infants use every one of their biological systems to
make meaning of their self in relation to the world of things and people.
V an der Kolk shows that those very same systems continue to operate at
every age, and that traumatic experiences, especially chronic toxic
experience during early development, produce psychic devastation. W ith
this understanding he provides insight and guidance for survivors,
researchers, and clinicians alike. Bessel van der Kolk may focus on the
body and trauma, but what a mind he must have to have written this book.”
—Ed T ronick, distinguished professor , University of Massachusetts, Boston;
author of Neur obehavior and Social Emotional Development of Infants and
Y oung Childr en
“ The Body Keeps the Scor e  eloquently articulates how overwhelming
experiences af fect the development of brain, mind, and body awareness, all
of which are closely intertwined. The resulting derailments have a profound
impact on the capacity for love and work. This rich integration of clinical
case examples with ground breaking scientific studies provides us with a
new understanding of trauma, which inevitably leads to the exploration of
novel therapeutic approaches that ‘rewire’ the brain, and help traumatized
people to reengage in the present. This book will provide traumatized
individuals with a guide to healing and permanently change how
psychologists and psychiatrists think about trauma and recovery .”
—Ruth A. Lanius, MD, PhD, Harris-W oodman chair in Psyche and Soma,
professor of psychiatry , and director PTSD research at the University of W estern
Ontario; author of The Impact of Early Life T rauma on Health and Disease

“When it comes to understanding the impact of trauma and being able to
continue to grow despite overwhelming life experiences, Bessel van der
Kolk leads the way in his comprehensive knowledge, clinical courage, and
creative strategies to help us heal. The Body Keeps the Scor e  is a cutting-
edge of fering for the general reader to comprehend the complex ef fects of
trauma, and a guide to a wide array of scientifically informed approaches to
not only reduce suf fering, but to move beyond mere survival— and to
thrive.”
—Daniel J. Siegel, MD, clinical professor , UCLA School of Medicine, author of
Brainstorm: The Power and Purpose of the T eenage Brain; Mindsight: The New
Science of Personal T ransformation;  and The Developing Mind: How
Relationships and the Brain Interact to Shape Who W e Ar e
“In this magnificent book, Bessel van der Kolk takes the reader on a
captivating journey that is chock-full of riveting stories of patients and their
struggles interpreted through history , research, and neuroscience made
accessible in the words of a gifted storyteller . W e are privy to the author ’ s
own courageous ef forts to understand and treat trauma over the past forty
years, the results of which have broken new ground and challenged the
status quo of psychiatry and psychotherapy . The Body Keeps the Scor e
leaves us with both a profound appreciation for and a felt sense of the
debilitating ef fects of trauma, along with hope for the future through
fascinating descriptions of novel approaches to treatment. This outstanding
volume is absolutely essential reading not only for therapists but for all who
seek to understand, prevent, or treat the immense suf fering caused by
trauma.”
—Pat Ogden PhD, founder/educational director of the Sensorimotor
Psychotherapy Institute; author of  Sensorimotor Psychotherapy: Interventions
for T rauma and Attachment
“This is masterpiece of powerful understanding and brave heartedness, one
of the most intelligent and helpful works on trauma I have ever read. Dr .
V an der Kolk of fer a brilliant synthesis of clinical cases, neuroscience,
powerful tools and caring humanity , of fering a whole new level of healing
for the traumas carried by so many .”

ne does not have be a combat soldier , or visit a refugee camp in Syria
or the Congo to encounter trauma. T rauma happens to us, our friends,
our families, and our neighbors. Research by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention has shown that one in five Americans was sexually
molested as a child; one in four was beaten by a parent to the point of a
mark being left on their body; and one in three couples engages in physical
violence. A quarter of us grew up with alcoholic relatives, and one out of
eight witnessed their mother being beaten or hit.1
As human beings we belong to an extremely resilient species. Since
time immemorial we have rebounded from our relentless wars, countless
disasters (both natural and man-made), and the violence and betrayal in our
own lives. But traumatic experiences do leave traces, whether on a lar ge
scale (on our histories and cultures) or close to home, on our families, with
dark secrets being imperceptibly passed down through generations. They
also leave traces on our minds and emotions, on our capacity for joy and
intimacy , and even on our biology and immune systems.
T rauma af fects not only those who are directly exposed to it, but also
those around them. Soldiers returning home from combat may frighten their
families with their rages and emotional absence. The wives of men who
suf fer from PTSD tend to become depressed, and the children of depressed
mothers are at risk of growing up insecure and anxious. Having been
exposed to family violence as a child often makes it dif ficult to establish
stable, trusting relationships as an adult.

T rauma, by definition, is unbearable and intolerable. Most rape victims,
combat soldiers, and children who have been molested become so upset
when they think about what they experienced that they try to push it out of
their minds, trying to act as if nothing happened, and move on. It takes
tremendous ener gy to keep functioning while carrying the memory of terror ,
and the shame of utter weakness and vulnerability .
While we all want to move beyond trauma, the part of our brain that is
devoted to ensuring our survival (deep below our rational brain) is not very
good at denial. Long after a traumatic experience is over , it may be
reactivated at the slightest hint of danger and mobilize disturbed brain
circuits and secrete massive amounts of stress hormones. This precipitates
unpleasant emotions intense physical sensations, and impulsive and
aggressive actions. These posttraumatic reactions feel incomprehensible
and overwhelming. Feeling out of control, survivors of trauma often begin
to fear that they are damaged to the core and beyond redemption.
 • • • 
The first time I remember being drawn to study medicine was at a summer
camp when I was about fourteen years old. My cousin Michael kept me up
all night explaining the intricacies of how kidneys work, how they secrete
the body’ s waste materials and then reabsorb the chemicals that keep the
system in balance. I was riveted by his account of the miraculous way the
body functions. Later , during every stage of my medical training, whether I
was studying sur gery , cardiology , or pediatrics, it was obvious to me that
the key to healing was understanding how the human or ganism works.
When I began my psychiatry rotation, however , I was struck by the contrast
between the incredible complexity of the mind and the ways that we human
beings are connected and attached to one another , and how little
psychiatrists knew about the origins of the problems they were treating.
W ould it be possible one day to know as much about brains, minds, and
love as we do about the other systems that make up our or ganism?
W e are obviously still years from attaining that sort of detailed
understanding, but the birth of three new branches of science has led to an
explosion of knowledge about the ef fects of psychological trauma, abuse,
and neglect. Those new disciplines are neuroscience, the study of how the

brain supports mental processes; developmental psychopathology , the study
of the impact of adverse experiences on the development of mind and brain;
and interpersonal neurobiology , the study of how our behavior influences
the emotions, biology , and mind-sets of those around us.
Research from these new disciplines has revealed that trauma produces
actual physiological changes, including a recalibration of the brain’ s alarm
system, an increase in stress hormone activity , and alterations in the system
that filters relevant information from irrelevant. W e now know that trauma
compromises the brain area that communicates the physical, embodied
feeling of being alive. These changes explain why traumatized individuals
become hypervigilant to threat at the expense of spontaneously engaging in
their day-to-day lives. They also help us understand why traumatized
people so often keep repeating the same problems and have such trouble
learning from experience. W e now know that their behaviors are not the
result of moral failings or signs of lack of willpower or bad character—they
are caused by actual changes in the brain.
This vast increase in our knowledge about the basic processes that
underlie trauma has also opened up new possibilities to palliate or even
reverse the damage. W e can now develop methods and experiences that
utilize the brain’ s own natural neuroplasticity to help survivors feel fully
alive in the present and move on with their lives. There are fundamentally
three avenues: 1) top down, by talking, (re-) connecting with others, and
allowing ourselves to know and understand what is going on with us, while
processing the memories of the trauma; 2) by taking medicines that shut
down inappropriate alarm reactions, or by utilizing other technologies that
change the way the brain or ganizes information, and 3) bottom up: by
allowing the body to have experiences that deeply and viscerally contradict
the helplessness, rage, or collapse that result from trauma. Which one of
these is best for any particular survivor is an empirical question. Most
people I have worked with require a combination.
This has been my life’ s work. In this ef fort I have been supported by
my colleagues and students at the T rauma Center , which I founded thirty
years ago. T ogether we have treated thousands of traumatized children and
adults: victims of child abuse, natural disasters, wars, accidents, and human
traf ficking; people who have suf fered assaults by intimates and strangers.
W e have a long tradition of discussing all our patients in great depth at

weekly treatment team meetings and carefully tracking how well dif ferent
forms of treatment work for particular individuals.
Our principal mission has always been to take care of the children and
adults who have come to us for treatment, but from the very beginning we
also have dedicated ourselves to conducting research to explore the ef fects
of traumatic stress on dif ferent populations and to determine what
treatments work for whom. W e have been supported by research grants
from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control,
and a number of private foundations to study the ef ficacy of many dif ferent
forms of treatment, from medications to talking, yoga, EMDR, theater , and
neurofeedback.
The challenge is: How can people gain control over the residues of past
trauma and return to being masters of their own ship? T alking,
understanding, and human connections help, and drugs can dampen
hyperactive alarm systems. But we will also see that the imprints from the
past can be transformed by having physical experiences that directly
contradict the helplessness, rage, and collapse that are part of trauma, and
thereby regaining self-mastery . I have no preferred treatment modality , as
no single approach fits everybody , but I practice all the forms of treatment
that I discuss in this book. Each one of them can produce profound changes,
depending on the nature of the particular problem and the makeup of the
individual person.
I wrote this book to serve as both a guide and an invitation—an
invitation to dedicate ourselves to facing the reality of trauma, to explore
how best to treat it, and to commit ourselves, as a society , to using every
means we have to prevent it.

THE REDISCOVER Y

I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast
day in the winter of 1975. . . . That was a long time ago, but it’ s
wrong what they say about the past. . . . Looking back now , I
realize I have been peeking into that deserted alley for the last
twenty-six years.
—Khaled Hosseini, The Kite Runner
Some people’ s lives seem to flow in a narrative; mine had many
stops and starts. That’ s what trauma does. It interrupts the plot. . . .
It just happens, and then life goes on. No one prepares you for it.
—Jessica Stern, Denial: A Memoir of T error
he T uesday after the Fourth of July weekend, 1978, was my first day as
a staf f psychiatrist at the Boston V eterans Administration Clinic. As I
was hanging a reproduction of my favorite Breughel painting, “The Blind
Leading the Blind,” on the wall of my new of fice, I heard a commotion in
the reception area down the hall. A moment later a lar ge, disheveled man in
a stained three-piece suit, carrying a copy of Soldier of Fortune  magazine
under his arm, burst through my door . He was so agitated and so clearly

hungover that I wondered how I could possibly help this hulking man. I
asked him to take a seat, and tell me what I could do for him.
His name was T om. T en years earlier he had been in the Marines, doing
his service in V ietnam. He had spent the holiday weekend holed up in his
downtown-Boston law of fice, drinking and looking at old photographs,
rather than with his family . He knew from previous years’ experience that
the noise, the fireworks, the heat, and the picnic in his sister ’ s backyard
against the backdrop of dense early-summer foliage, all of which reminded
him of V ietnam, would drive him crazy . When he got upset he was afraid to
be around his family because he behaved like a monster with his wife and
two young boys. The noise of his kids made him so agitated that he would
storm out of the house to keep himself from hurting them. Only drinking
himself into oblivion or riding his Harley-Davidson at dangerously high
speeds helped him to calm down.
Nighttime of fered no relief—his sleep was constantly interrupted by
nightmares about an ambush in a rice paddy back in ’Nam, in which all the
members of his platoon were killed or wounded. He also had terrifying
flashbacks in which he saw dead V ietnamese children. The nightmares were
so horrible that he dreaded falling asleep and he often stayed up for most of
the night, drinking. In the morning his wife would find him passed out on
the living room couch, and she and the boys had to tiptoe around him while
she made them breakfast before taking them to school.
Filling me in on his background, T om said that he had graduated from
high school in 1965, the valedictorian of his class. In line with his family
tradition of military service he enlisted in the Marine Corps immediately
after graduation. His father had served in W orld W ar II in General Patton’ s
army , and T om never questioned his father ’ s expectations. Athletic,
intelligent, and an obvious leader , T om felt powerful and ef fective after
finishing basic training, a member of a team that was prepared for just
about anything. In V ietnam he quickly became a platoon leader , in char ge
of eight other Marines. Surviving slogging through the mud while being
strafed by machine-gun fire can leave people feeling pretty good about
themselves—and their comrades.
At the end of his tour of duty T om was honorably dischar ged, and all he
wanted was to put V ietnam behind him. Outwardly that’ s exactly what he
did. He attended college on the GI Bill, graduated from law school, married

his high school sweetheart, and had two sons. T om was upset by how
dif ficult it was to feel any real af fection for his wife, even though her letters
had kept him alive in the madness of the jungle. T om went through the
motions of living a normal life, hoping that by faking it he would learn to
become his old self again. He now had a thriving law practice and a picture-
perfect family , but he sensed he wasn’ t normal; he felt dead inside.
Although T om was the first veteran I had ever encountered on a
professional basis, many aspects of his story were familiar to me. I grew up
in postwar Holland, playing in bombed-out buildings, the son of a man who
had been such an outspoken opponent of the Nazis that he had been sent to
an internment camp. My father never talked about his war experiences, but
he was given to outbursts of explosive rage that stunned me as a little boy .
How could the man I heard quietly going down the stairs every morning to
pray and read the Bible while the rest of the family slept have such a
terrifying temper? How could someone whose life was devoted to the
pursuit of social justice be so filled with anger? I witnessed the same
puzzling behavior in my uncle, who had been captured by the Japanese in
the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and sent as a slave laborer to Burma,
where he worked on the famous bridge over the river Kwai. He also rarely
mentioned the war , and he, too, often erupted into uncontrollable rages.
As I listened to T om, I wondered if my uncle and my father had had
nightmares and flashbacks—if they , too, had felt disconnected from their
loved ones and unable to find any real pleasure in their lives. Somewhere in
the back of my mind there must also have been my memories of my
frightened—and often frightening—mother , whose own childhood trauma
was sometimes alluded to and, I now believe, was frequently reenacted. She
had the unnerving habit of fainting when I asked her what her life was like
as a little girl and then blaming me for making her so upset.
Reassured by my obvious interest, T om settled down to tell me just
how scared and confused he was. He was afraid that he was becoming just
like his father , who was always angry and rarely talked with his children—
except to compare them unfavorably with his comrades who had lost their
lives around Christmas 1944, during the Battle of the Bulge.
As the session was drawing to a close, I did what doctors typically do: I
focused on the one part of T om’ s story that I thought I understood—his
nightmares. As a medical student I had worked in a sleep laboratory ,

observing people’ s sleep/dream cycles, and had assisted in writing some
articles about nightmares. I had also participated in some early research on
the beneficial ef fects of the psychoactive drugs that were just coming into
use in the 1970s. So, while I lacked a true grasp of the scope of T om’ s
problems, the nightmares were something I could relate to, and as an
enthusiastic believer in better living through chemistry , I prescribed a drug
that we had found to be ef fective in reducing the incidence and severity of
nightmares. I scheduled T om for a follow-up visit two weeks later .
When he returned for his appointment, I eagerly asked T om how the
medicines had worked. He told me he hadn’ t taken any of the pills. T rying
to conceal my irritation, I asked him why . “I realized that if I take the pills
and the nightmares go away ,” he replied, “I will have abandoned my
friends, and their deaths will have been in vain. I need to be a living
memorial to my friends who died in V ietnam.”
I was stunned: T om’ s loyalty to the dead was keeping him from living
his own life, just as his father ’ s devotion to his friends had kept him from
living. Both father ’ s and son’ s experiences on the battlefield had rendered
the rest of their lives irrelevant. How had that happened, and what could we
do about it? That morning I realized I would probably spend the rest of my
professional life trying to unravel the mysteries of trauma. How do horrific
experiences cause people to become hopelessly stuck in the past? What
happens in people’ s minds and brains that keeps them frozen, trapped in a
place they desperately wish to escape? Why did this man’ s war not come to
an end in February 1969, when his parents embraced him at Boston’ s Logan
International Airport after his long flight back from Da Nang?
T om’ s need to live out his life as a memorial to his comrades taught me
that he was suf fering from a condition much more complex than simply
having bad memories or damaged brain chemistry—or altered fear circuits
in the brain. Before the ambush in the rice paddy , T om had been a devoted
and loyal friend, someone who enjoyed life, with many interests and
pleasures. In one terrifying moment, trauma had transformed everything.
During my time at the V A I got to know many men who responded
similarly . Faced with even minor frustrations, our veterans often flew
instantly into extreme rages. The public areas of the clinic were
pockmarked with the impacts of their fists on the drywall, and security was
kept constantly busy protecting claims agents and receptionists from

enraged veterans. Of course, their behavior scared us, but I also was
intrigued.
At home my wife and I were coping with similar problems in our
toddlers, who regularly threw temper tantrums when told to eat their
spinach or to put on warm socks. Why was it, then, that I was utterly
unconcerned about my kids’ immature behavior but deeply worried by what
was going on with the vets (aside from their size, of course, which gave
them the potential to inflict much more harm than my two-footers at
home)? The reason was that I felt perfectly confident that, with proper care,
my kids would gradually learn to deal with frustrations and
disappointments, but I was skeptical that I would be able to help my
veterans reacquire the skills of self-control and self-regulation that they had
lost in the war .
Unfortunately , nothing in my psychiatric training had prepared me to
deal with any of the challenges that T om and his fellow veterans presented.
I went down to the medical library to look for books on war neurosis, shell
shock, battle fatigue, or any other term or diagnosis I could think of that
might shed light on my patients. T o my surprise the library at the V A didn’ t
have a single book about any of these conditions. Five years after the last
American soldier left V ietnam, the issue of wartime trauma was still not on
anybody’ s agenda. Finally , in the Countway Library at Harvard Medical
School, I discovered The T raumatic Neur oses of W ar , which had been
published in 1941 by a psychiatrist named Abram Kardiner . It described
Kardiner ’ s observations of W orld W ar I veterans and had been released in
anticipation of the flood of shell-shocked soldiers expected to be casualties
of W orld W ar II.1
Kardiner reported the same phenomena I was seeing: After the war his
patients were overtaken by a sense of futility; they became withdrawn and
detached, even if they had functioned well before. What Kardiner called
“traumatic neuroses,” today we call posttraumatic stress disorder—PTSD.
Kardiner noted that suf ferers from traumatic neuroses develop a chronic
vigilance for and sensitivity to threat. His summation especially caught my
eye: “The nucleus of the neurosis is a physioneurosis.”2 In other words,
posttraumatic stress isn’ t “all in one’ s head,” as some people supposed, but

has a physiological basis. Kardiner understood even then that the symptoms
have their origin in the entire body’ s response to the original trauma.
Kardiner ’ s description corroborated my own observations, which was
reassuring, but it provided me with little guidance on how to help the
veterans. The lack of literature on the topic was a handicap, but my great
teacher , Elvin Semrad, had taught us to be skeptical about textbooks. W e
had only one real textbook, he said: our patients. W e should trust only what
we could learn from them—and from our own experience. This sounds so
simple, but even as Semrad pushed us to rely upon self-knowledge, he also
warned us how dif ficult that process really is, since human beings are
experts in wishful thinking and obscuring the truth. I remember him saying:
“The greatest sources of our suf fering are the lies we tell ourselves.”
W orking at the V A I soon discovered how excruciating it can be to face
reality . This was true both for my patients and for myself.
W e don’ t really want to know what soldiers go through in combat. W e
do not really want to know how many children are being molested and
abused in our own society or how many couples—almost a third, as it turns
out—engage in violence at some point during their relationship. W e want to
think of families as safe havens in a heartless world and of our own country
as populated by enlightened, civilized people. W e prefer to believe that
cruelty occurs only in faraway places like Darfur or the Congo. It is hard
enough for observers to bear witness to pain. Is it any wonder , then, that the
traumatized individuals themselves cannot tolerate remembering it and that
they often resort to using drugs, alcohol, or self-mutilation to block out their
unbearable knowledge?
T om and his fellow veterans became my first teachers in my quest to
understand how lives are shattered by overwhelming experiences, and in
figuring out how to enable them to feel fully alive again.
TRAUMA AND THE LOSS OF SELF
The first study I did at the V A started with systematically asking veterans
what had happened to them in V ietnam. I wanted to know what had pushed
them over the brink, and why some had broken down as a result of that
experience while others had been able to go on with their lives.3 Most of the

men I interviewed had gone to war feeling well prepared, drawn close by
the rigors of basic training and the shared danger . They exchanged pictures
of their families and girlfriends; they put up with one another ’ s flaws. And
they were prepared to risk their lives for their friends. Most of them
confided their dark secrets to a buddy , and some went so far as to share each
other ’ s shirts and socks.
Many of the men had friendships similar to T om’ s with Alex. T om met
Alex, an Italian guy from Malden, Massachusetts, on his first day in
country , and they instantly became close friends. They drove their jeep
together , listened to the same music, and read each other ’ s letters from
home. They got drunk together and chased the same V ietnamese bar girls.
After about three months in country T om led his squad on a foot patrol
through a rice paddy just before sunset. Suddenly a hail of gunfire spurted
from the green wall of the surrounding jungle, hitting the men around him
one by one. T om told me how he had looked on in helpless horror as all the
members of his platoon were killed or wounded in a matter of seconds. He
would never get one image out of his mind: the back of Alex’ s head as he
lay facedown in the rice paddy , his feet in the air . T om wept as he recalled,
“He was the only real friend I ever had.” Afterward, at night, T om
continued to hear the screams of his men and to see their bodies falling into
the water . Any sounds, smells, or images that reminded him of the ambush
(like the popping of firecrackers on the Fourth of July) made him feel just
as paralyzed, terrified, and enraged as he had the day the helicopter
evacuated him from the rice paddy .
Maybe even worse for T om than the recurrent flashbacks of the ambush
was the memory of what happened afterward. I could easily imagine how
T om’ s rage about his friend’ s death had led to the calamity that followed. It
took him months of dealing with his paralyzing shame before he could tell
me about it. Since time immemorial veterans, like Achilles in Homer ’ s
Iliad , have responded to the death of their comrades with unspeakable acts
of revenge. The day after the ambush T om went into a frenzy to a
neighboring village, killing children, shooting an innocent farmer , and
raping a V ietnamese woman. After that it became truly impossible for him
to go home again in any meaningful way . How can you face your
sweetheart and tell her that you brutally raped a woman just like her , or
watch your son take his first step when you are reminded of the child you

murdered? T om experienced the death of Alex as if part of himself had been
forever destroyed—the part that was good and honorable and trustworthy .
T rauma, whether it is the result of something done to you or something you
yourself have done, almost always makes it dif ficult to engage in intimate
relationships. After you have experienced something so unspeakable, how
do you learn to trust yourself or anyone else again? Or , conversely , how can
you surrender to an intimate relationship after you have been brutally
violated?
T om kept showing up faithfully for his appointments, as I had become
for him a lifeline—the father he’d never had, an Alex who had survived the
ambush. It takes enormous trust and courage to allow yourself to remember .
One of the hardest things for traumatized people is to confront their shame
about the way they behaved during a traumatic episode, whether it is
objectively warranted (as in the commission of atrocities) or not (as in the
case of a child who tries to placate her abuser). One of the first people to
write about this phenomenon was Sarah Haley , who occupied an of fice next
to mine at the V A Clinic. In an article entitled “When the Patient Reports
Atrocities,”4 which became a major impetus for the ultimate creation of the
PTSD diagnosis, she discussed the well-nigh intolerable dif ficulty of talking
about (and listening to) the horrendous acts that are often committed by
soldiers in the course of their war experiences. It’ s hard enough to face the
suf fering that has been inflicted by others, but deep down many traumatized
people are even more haunted by the shame they feel about what they
themselves did or did not do under the circumstances. They despise
themselves for how terrified, dependent, excited, or enraged they felt.
In later years I encountered a similar phenomenon in victims of child
abuse: Most of them suf fer from agonizing shame about the actions they
took to survive and maintain a connection with the person who abused
them. This was particularly true if the abuser was someone close to the
child, someone the child depended on, as is so often the case. The result can
be confusion about whether one was a victim or a willing participant, which
in turn leads to bewilderment about the dif ference between love and terror;
pain and pleasure. W e will return to this dilemma throughout this book.
NUMBING

Maybe the worst of T om’ s symptoms was that he felt emotionally numb. He
desperately wanted to love his family , but he just couldn’ t evoke any deep
feelings for them. He felt emotionally distant from everybody , as though his
heart were frozen and he were living behind a glass wall. That numbness
extended to himself, as well. He could not really feel anything except for
his momentary rages and his shame. He described how he hardly
recognized himself when he looked in the mirror to shave. When he heard
himself ar guing a case in court, he would observe himself from a distance
and wonder how this guy , who happened to look and talk like him, was able
to make such cogent ar guments. When he won a case he pretended to be
gratified, and when he lost it was as though he had seen it coming and was
resigned to the defeat even before it happened. Despite the fact that he was
a very ef fective lawyer , he always felt as though he were floating in space,
lacking any sense of purpose or direction.
The only thing that occasionally relieved this feeling of aimlessness
was intense involvement in a particular case. During the course of our
treatment T om had to defend a mobster on a murder char ge. For the
duration of that trial he was totally absorbed in devising a strategy for
winning the case, and there were many occasions on which he stayed up all
night to immerse himself in something that actually excited him. It was like
being in combat, he said—he felt fully alive, and nothing else mattered. The
moment T om won that case, however , he lost his ener gy and sense of
purpose. The nightmares returned, as did his rage attacks—so intensely that
he had to move into a motel to ensure that he would not harm his wife or
children. But being alone, too, was terrifying, because the demons of the
war returned in full force. T om tried to stay busy , working, drinking, and
drugging—doing anything to avoid confronting his demons.
He kept thumbing through Soldier of Fortune,  fantasizing about
enlisting as a mercenary in one of the many regional wars then raging in
Africa. That spring he took out his Harley and roared up the Kancamagus
Highway in New Hampshire. The vibrations, speed, and danger of that ride
helped him pull himself back together , to the point that he was able to leave
his motel room and return to his family .
THE REORGANIZA TION OF PERCEPTION

Another study I conducted at the V A started out as research about
nightmares but ended up exploring how trauma changes people’ s
perceptions and imagination. Bill, a former medic who had seen heavy
action in V ietnam a decade earlier , was the first person enrolled in my
nightmare study . After his dischar ge he had enrolled in a theological
seminary and had been assigned to his first parish in a Congregational
church in a Boston suburb. He was doing fine until he and his wife had their
first child. Soon after the baby’ s birth, his wife, a nurse, had gone back to
work while he remained at home, working on his weekly sermon and other
parish duties and taking care of their newborn. On the very first day he was
left alone with the baby , it began to cry , and he found himself suddenly
flooded with unbearable images of dying children in V ietnam.
Bill had to call his wife to take over child care and came to the V A in a
panic. He described how he kept hearing the sounds of babies crying and
seeing images of burned and bloody children’ s faces. My medical
colleagues thought that he must surely be psychotic, because the textbooks
of the time said that auditory and visual hallucinations were symptoms of
paranoid schizophrenia. The same texts that provided this diagnosis also
supplied a cause: Bill’ s psychosis was probably triggered by his feeling
displaced in his wife’ s af fections by their new baby .
As I arrived at the intake of fice that day , I saw Bill surrounded by
worried doctors who were preparing to inject him with a powerful
antipsychotic drug and ship him of f to a locked ward. They described his
symptoms and asked my opinion. Having worked in a previous job on a
ward specializing in the treatment of schizophrenics, I was intrigued.
Something about the diagnosis didn’ t sound right. I asked Bill if I could talk
with him, and after hearing his story , I unwittingly paraphrased something
Sigmund Freud had said about trauma in 1895: “I think this man is
suf fering from memories.” I told Bill that I would try to help him and, after
of fering him some medications to control his panic, asked if he would be
willing to come back a few days later to participate in my nightmare study .5
He agreed.
As part of that study we gave our participants a Rorschach test.6 Unlike
tests that require answers to straightforward questions, responses to the
Rorschach are almost impossible to fake. The Rorschach provides us with a

unique way to observe how people construct a mental image from what is
basically a meaningless stimulus: a blot of ink. Because humans are
meaning-making creatures, we have a tendency to create some sort of
image or story out of those inkblots, just as we do when we lie in a meadow
on a beautiful summer day and see images in the clouds floating high
above. What people make out of these blots can tell us a lot about how their
minds work.
On seeing the second card of the Rorschach test, Bill exclaimed in
horror , “This is that child that I saw being blown up in V ietnam. In the
middle, you see the charred flesh, the wounds, and the blood is spurting out
all over .” Panting and with sweat beading on his forehead, he was in a panic
similar to the one that had initially brought him to the V A clinic. Although I
had heard veterans describing their flashbacks, this was the first time I
actually witnessed one. In that very moment in my of fice, Bill was
obviously seeing the same images, smelling the same smells, and feeling
the same physical sensations he had felt during the original event. T en years
after helplessly holding a dying baby in his arms, Bill was reliving the
trauma in response to an inkblot.
Experiencing Bill’ s flashback firsthand in my of fice helped me realize
the agony that regularly visited the veterans I was trying to treat and helped
me appreciate again how critical it was to find a solution. The traumatic
event itself, however horrendous, had a beginning, a middle, and an end,
but I now saw that flashbacks could be even worse. Y ou never know when
you will be assaulted by them again and you have no way of telling when
they will stop. It took me years to learn how to ef fectively treat flashbacks,
and in this process Bill turned out to be one of my most important mentors.
When we gave the Rorschach test to twenty-one additional veterans,
the response was consistent: Sixteen of them, on seeing the second card,
reacted as if they were experiencing a wartime trauma. The second
Rorschach card is the first card that contains color and often elicits so-
called color shock in response. The veterans interpreted this card with
descriptions like “These are the bowels of my friend Jim after a mortar shell
ripped him open” and “This is the neck of my friend Danny after his head
was blown of f by a shell while we were eating lunch.” None of them
mentioned dancing monks, fluttering butterflies, men on motorcycles, or

any of the other ordinary , sometimes whimsical images that most people
see.
While the majority of the veterans were greatly upset by what they saw ,
the reactions of the remaining five were even more alarming: They simply
went blank. “This is nothing,” one observed, “just a bunch of ink.” They
were right, of course, but the normal human response to ambiguous stimuli
is to use our imagination to read something into them.
W e learned from these Rorschach tests that traumatized people have a
tendency to superimpose their trauma on everything around them and have
trouble deciphering whatever is going on around them. There appeared to
be little in between. W e also learned that trauma af fects the imagination.
The five men who saw nothing in the blots had lost the capacity to let their
minds play . But so, too, had the other sixteen men, for in viewing scenes
from the past in those blots they were not displaying the mental flexibility
that is the hallmark of imagination. They simply kept replaying an old reel.
Imagination is absolutely critical to the quality of our lives. Our
imagination enables us to leave our routine everyday existence by
fantasizing about travel, food, sex, falling in love, or having the last word—
all the things that make life interesting. Imagination gives us the
opportunity to envision new possibilities—it is an essential launchpad for
making our hopes come true. It fires our creativity , relieves our boredom,
alleviates our pain, enhances our pleasure, and enriches our most intimate
relationships. When people are compulsively and constantly pulled back
into the past, to the last time they felt intense involvement and deep
emotions, they suf fer from a failure of imagination, a loss of the mental
flexibility . W ithout imagination there is no hope, no chance to envision a
better future, no place to go, no goal to reach.
The Rorschach tests also taught us that traumatized people look at the
world in a fundamentally dif ferent way from other people. For most of us a
man coming down the street is just someone taking a walk. A rape victim,
however , may see a person who is about to molest her and go into a panic.
A stern schoolteacher may be an intimidating presence to an average kid,
but for a child whose stepfather beats him up, she may represent a torturer
and precipitate a rage attack or a terrified cowering in the corner .

STUCK IN TRAUMA
Our clinic was inundated with veterans seeking psychiatric help. However ,
because of an acute shortage of qualified doctors, all we could do was put
most of them on a waiting list, even as they continued brutalizing
themselves and their families. W e began seeing a sharp increase in arrests
of veterans for violent of fenses and drunken brawls—as well as an alarming
number of suicides. I received permission to start a group for young
V ietnam veterans to serve as a sort of holding tank until “real” therapy
could start.
At the opening session for a group of former Marines, the first man to
speak flatly declared, “I do not want to talk about the war .” I replied that the
members could discuss anything they wanted. After half an hour of
excruciating silence, one veteran finally started to talk about his helicopter
crash. T o my amazement the rest immediately came to life, speaking with
great intensity about their traumatic experiences. All of them returned the
following week and the week after . In the group they found resonance and
meaning in what had previously been only sensations of terror and
emptiness. They felt a renewed sense of the comradeship that had been so
vital to their war experience. They insisted that I had to be part of their
newfound unit and gave me a Marine captain’ s uniform for my birthday . In
retrospect that gesture revealed part of the problem: Y ou were either in or
out—you either belonged to the unit or you were nobody . After trauma the
world becomes sharply divided between those who know and those who
don’ t. People who have not shared the traumatic experience cannot be
trusted, because they can’ t understand it. Sadly , this often includes spouses,
children, and co-workers.
Later I led another group, this time for veterans of Patton’ s army—men
now well into their seventies, all old enough to be my father . W e met on
Monday mornings at eight o’clock. In Boston winter snowstorms
occasionally paralyze the public transit system, but to my amazement all of
them showed up even during blizzards, some of them trudging several miles
through the snow to reach the V A Clinic. For Christmas they gave me a
1940s GI-issue wristwatch. As had been the case with my group of
Marines, I could not be their doctor unless they made me one of them.

Moving as these experiences were, the limits of group therapy became
clear when I ur ged the men to talk about the issues they confronted in their
daily lives: their relationships with their wives, children, girlfriends, and
family; dealing with their bosses and finding satisfaction in their work; their
heavy use of alcohol. Their typical response was to balk and resist and
instead recount yet again how they had plunged a dagger through the heart
of a German soldier in the Hürtgen Forest or how their helicopter had been
shot down in the jungles of V ietnam.
Whether the trauma had occurred ten years in the past or more than
forty , my patients could not bridge the gap between their wartime
experiences and their current lives. Somehow the very event that caused
them so much pain had also become their sole source of meaning. They felt
fully alive only when they were revisiting their traumatic past.
DIAGNOSING POSTTRAUMA TIC STRESS
In those early days at the V A, we labeled our veterans with all sorts of
diagnoses—alcoholism, substance abuse, depression, mood disorder , even
schizophrenia—and we tried every treatment in our textbooks. But for all
our ef forts it became clear that we were actually accomplishing very little.
The powerful drugs we prescribed often left the men in such a fog that they
could barely function. When we encouraged them to talk about the precise
details of a traumatic event, we often inadvertently triggered a full-blown
flashback, rather than helping them resolve the issue. Many of them
dropped out of treatment because we were not only failing to help but also
sometimes making things worse.
A turning point arrived in 1980, when a group of V ietnam veterans,
aided by the New Y ork psychoanalysts Chaim Shatan and Robert J. Lifton,
successfully lobbied the American Psychiatric Association to create a new
diagnosis: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which described a cluster
of symptoms that was common, to a greater or lesser extent, to all of our
veterans. Systematically identifying the symptoms and grouping them
together into a disorder finally gave a name to the suf fering of people who
were overwhelmed by horror and helplessness. W ith the conceptual
framework of PTSD in place, the stage was set for a radical change in our

understanding of our patients. This eventually led to an explosion of
research and attempts at finding ef fective treatments.
Inspired by the possibilities presented by this new diagnosis, I proposed
a study on the biology of traumatic memories to the V A. Did the memories
of those suf fering from PTSD dif fer from those of others? For most people
the memory of an unpleasant event eventually fades or is transformed into
something more benign. But most of our patients were unable to make their
past into a story that happened long ago.7
The opening line of the grant rejection read: “It has never been shown
that PTSD is relevant to the mission of the V eterans Administration.” Since
then, of course, the mission of the V A has become or ganized around the
diagnosis of PTSD and brain injury , and considerable resources are
dedicated to applying “evidence-based treatments” to traumatized war
veterans. But at the time things were dif ferent and, unwilling to keep
working in an or ganization whose view of reality was so at odds with my
own, I handed in my resignation; in 1982 I took a position at the
Massachusetts Mental Health Center , the Harvard teaching hospital where I
had trained to become a psychiatrist. My new responsibility was to teach a
fledgling area of study: psychopharmacology , the administration of drugs to
alleviate mental illness.
In my new job I was confronted on an almost daily basis with issues I
thought I had left behind at the V A. My experience with combat veterans
had so sensitized me to the impact of trauma that I now listened with a very
dif ferent ear when depressed and anxious patients told me stories of
molestation and family violence. I was particularly struck by how many
female patients spoke of being sexually abused as children. This was
puzzling, as the standard textbook of psychiatry at the time stated that incest
was extremely rare in the United States, occurring about once in every
million women.8 Given that there were then only about one hundred million
women living in the United States, I wondered how forty seven, almost half
of them, had found their way to my of fice in the basement of the hospital.
Furthermore, the textbook said, “There is little agreement about the role
of father -daughter incest as a source of serious subsequent
psychopathology .” My patients with incest histories were hardly free of
“subsequent psychopathology”—they were profoundly depressed,

confused, and often engaged in bizarrely self-harmful behaviors, such as
cutting themselves with razor blades. The textbook went on to practically
endorse incest, explaining that “such incestuous activity diminishes the
subject’ s chance of psychosis and allows for a better adjustment to the
external world.”9 In fact, as it turned out, incest had devastating ef fects on
women’ s well-being.
In many ways these patients were not so dif ferent from the veterans I
had just left behind at the V A. They also had nightmares and flashbacks.
They also alternated between occasional bouts of explosive rage and long
periods of being emotionally shut down. Most of them had great dif ficulty
getting along with other people and had trouble maintaining meaningful
relationships.
As we now know , war is not the only calamity that leaves human lives
in ruins. While about a quarter of the soldiers who serve in war zones are
expected to develop serious posttraumatic problems,10 the majority of
Americans experience a violent crime at some time during their lives, and
more accurate reporting has revealed that twelve million women in the
United States have been victims of rape. More than half of all rapes occur in
girls below age fifteen.1 1 For many people the war begins at home: Each
year about three million children in the United States are reported as
victims of child abuse and neglect. One million of these cases are serious
and credible enough to force local child protective services or the courts to
take action.12 In other words, for every soldier who serves in a war zone
abroad, there are ten children who are endangered in their own homes. This
is particularly tragic, since it is very dif ficult for growing children to
recover when the source of terror and pain is not enemy combatants but
their own caretakers.
A NEW UNDERST ANDING
In the three decades since I met T om, we have learned an enormous amount
not only about the impact and manifestations of trauma but also about ways
to help traumatized people find their way back. Since the early 1990s brain-
imaging tools have started to show us what actually happens inside the
brains of traumatized people. This has proven essential to understanding the

damage inflicted by trauma and has guided us to formulate entirely new
avenues of repair .
W e have also begun to understand how overwhelming experiences
af fect our innermost sensations and our relationship to our physical reality
—the core of who we are. W e have learned that trauma is not just an event
that took place sometime in the past; it is also the imprint left by that
experience on mind, brain, and body . This imprint has ongoing
consequences for how the human or ganism manages to survive in the
present.
T rauma results in a fundamental reor ganization of the way mind and
brain manage perceptions. It changes not only how we think and what we
think about, but also our very capacity to think. W e have discovered that
helping victims of trauma find the words to describe what has happened to
them is profoundly meaningful, but usually it is not enough. The act of
telling the story doesn’ t necessarily alter the automatic physical and
hormonal responses of bodies that remain hypervigilant, prepared to be
assaulted or violated at any time. For real change to take place, the body
needs to learn that the danger has passed and to live in the reality of the
present. Our search to understand trauma has led us to think dif ferently not
only about the structure of the mind but also about the processes by which it
heals.

n the late 1960s, during a year of f between my first and second years of
medical school, I became an accidental witness to a profound transition
in the medical approach to mental suf fering. I had landed a plum job as an
attendant on a research ward at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center ,
where I was in char ge of or ganizing recreational activities for the patients.
MMHC had long been considered one of the finest psychiatric hospitals in
the country , a jewel in the crown of the Harvard Medical School teaching
empire. The goal of the research on my ward was to determine whether
psychotherapy or medication was the best way to treat young people who
had suf fered a first mental breakdown diagnosed as schizophrenia.

The talking cure, an of fshoot of Freudian psychoanalysis, was still the
primary treatment for mental illness at MMHC. However , in the early 1950s
a group of French scientists had discovered a new compound,
chlorpromazine (sold under the brand name Thorazine), that could
“tranquilize” patients and make them less agitated and delusional. That
inspired hope that drugs could be developed to treat serious mental
problems such as depression, panic, anxiety , and mania, as well as to
manage some of the most disturbing symptoms of schizophrenia.
As an attendant I had nothing to do with the research aspect of the ward
and was never told what treatment any of the patients was receiving. They
were all close to my age—college students from Harvard, MIT , and Boston
University . Some had tried to kill themselves; others cut themselves with
knives or razor blades; several had attacked their roommates or had
otherwise terrified their parents or friends with their unpredictable,
irrational behavior . My job was to keep them involved in normal activities
for college students, such as eating at the local pizza parlor , camping in a
nearby state forest, attending Red Sox games, and sailing on the Charles
River .
T otally new to the field, I sat in rapt attention during ward meetings,
trying to decipher the patients’ complicated speech and logic. I also had to
learn to deal with their irrational outbursts and terrified withdrawal. One
morning I found a patient standing like a statue in her bedroom with one
arm raised in a defensive gesture, her face frozen in fear . She remained
there, immobile, for at least twelve hours. The doctors gave me the name
for her condition, catatonia, but even the textbooks I consulted didn’ t tell
me what could be done about it. W e just let it run its course.
TRAUMA BEFORE DA WN
I spent many nights and weekends on the unit, which exposed me to things
the doctors never saw during their brief visits. When patients could not
sleep, they often wandered in their tightly wrapped bathrobes into the
darkened nursing station to talk. The quiet of the night seemed to help them
open up, and they told me stories about having been hit, assaulted, or
molested, often by their own parents, sometimes by relatives, classmates, or

neighbors. They shared memories of lying in bed at night, helpless and
terrified, hearing their mother being beaten by their father or a boyfriend,
hearing their parents yell horrible threats at each other , hearing the sounds
of furniture breaking. Others told me about fathers who came home drunk
—hearing their footsteps on the landing and how they waited for them to
come in, pull them out of bed, and punish them for some imagined of fense.
Several of the women recalled lying awake, motionless, waiting for the
inevitable—a brother or father coming in to molest them.
During morning rounds the young doctors presented their cases to their
supervisors, a ritual that the ward attendants were allowed to observe in
silence. They rarely mentioned stories like the ones I’d heard. However ,
many later studies have confirmed the relevance of those midnight
confessions: W e now know that more than half the people who seek
psychiatric care have been assaulted, abandoned, neglected, or even raped
as children, or have witnessed violence in their families.1 But such
experiences seemed to be of f the table during rounds.  I was often surprised
by the dispassionate way patients’ symptoms were discussed and by how
much time was spent on trying to manage their suicidal thoughts and self-
destructive behaviors, rather than on understanding the possible causes of
their despair and helplessness. I was also struck by how little attention was
paid to their accomplishments and aspirations; whom they cared for , loved,
or hated; what motivated and engaged them, what kept them stuck, and
what made them feel at peace—the ecology of their lives.
A few years later , as a young doctor , I was confronted with  an
especially stark example of the medical model in action. I was then
moonlighting at a Catholic hospital, doing physical examinations on women
who’d been admitted to receive electroshock treatment for depression.
Being my curious immigrant self, I’d look up from their charts to  ask them
about their lives. Many of them spilled out stories about painful marriages,
dif ficult children, and guilt over abortions.  As they spoke, they visibly
brightened and often thanked me ef fusively for listening to them. Some of
them wondered if they really still needed electroshock after having gotten
so much of f their chests. I always felt sad at the end of these meetings,
knowing that the treatments that would be administered the following

morning would erase all memory of our conversation. I did not last long in
that job.
On my days of f from the ward at MMHC, I often went to the Countway
Library of Medicine to learn more about the patients I was supposed to
help. One Saturday afternoon I came across a treatise that is still  revered
today:  Eugen Bleuler ’ s 191 1 textbook Dementia Praecox . Bleuler ’ s
observations were fascinating:
Among schizophrenic body hallucinations, the sexual ones are by
far the most frequent and the most important. All the raptures and
joys of normal and abnormal sexual satisfaction are experienced
by these patients, but even more frequently every obscene and
disgusting practice which the most extravagant fantasy can conjure
up. Male patients have their semen drawn of f; painful erections are
stimulated. The women patients are raped and injured in the most
devilish ways. . . . In spite of the symbolic meaning of many such
hallucinations, the majority of them correspond to real sensations.2
This made me wonder: Our patients had hallucinations—the doctors
routinely asked about them and noted them as signs of how disturbed the
patients were. But if the stories I’d heard in the wee hours were true, could
it be that these “hallucinations” were in fact the fragmented memories of
real experiences? W ere hallucinations just the concoctions of sick brains?
Could people make up physical sensations they had never experienced?
W as there a clear line between creativity and pathological imagination?
Between memory and imagination? These questions remain unanswered to
this day , but research has shown that people who’ve been abused as
children often feel sensations (such as abdominal pain) that have no obvious
physical cause; they hear voices warning of danger or accusing them of
heinous crimes.
There was no question that many patients on the ward engaged in
violent, bizarre, and self-destructive behaviors, particularly when they felt
frustrated, thwarted, or misunderstood. They threw temper tantrums, hurled
plates, smashed windows, and cut themselves with shards of glass. At that
time I had no idea why someone might react to a simple request (“Let me

clean that goop out of your hair”) with rage or terror . I usually followed the
lead of the experienced nurses, who signaled when to back of f or , if that did
not work, to restrain a patient. I was surprised and alarmed by the
satisfaction I sometimes felt after I’d wrestled a patient to the floor so a
nurse could give an injection, and I gradually realized how much of our
professional training was geared to helping us stay in control in the face of
terrifying and confusing realities.
Sylvia was a gor geous nineteen-year -old Boston University student
who usually sat alone in the corner of the ward, looking frightened to death
and virtually mute, but whose reputation as the girlfriend of an important
Boston mafioso gave her an aura of mystery . After she refused to eat for
more than a week and rapidly started to lose weight, the doctors decided to
force-feed her . It took three of us to hold her down, another to push the
rubber feeding tube down her throat, and a nurse to pour the liquid nutrients
into her stomach. Later , during a midnight confession, Sylvia spoke timidly
and hesitantly about her childhood sexual abuse by her brother and uncle. I
realized then our display of “caring” must have felt to her much like a gang
rape. This experience, and others like it, helped me formulate this rule for
my students: If you do something to a patient that you would not do to your
friends or children, consider whether you are unwittingly replicating a
trauma from the patient’ s past.
In my role as recreation leader I noticed other things: As a group the
patients were strikingly clumsy and physically uncoordinated. When we
went camping, most of them stood helplessly by as I pitched the tents. W e
almost capsized once in a squall on the Charles River because they huddled
rigidly in the lee, unable to grasp that they needed to shift position to
balance the boat. In volleyball games the staf f members invariably were
much better coordinated than the patients. Another characteristic they
shared was that even their most relaxed conversations seemed stilted,
lacking the natural flow of gestures and facial expressions that are typical
among friends. The relevance of these observations became clear only after
I’d met the body-based therapists Peter Levine and Pat Ogden; in the later
chapters I’ll have a lot to say about how trauma is held in people’ s bodies.
MAKING SENSE OF SUFFERING

After my year on the research ward I resumed medical school and then, as a
newly minted MD, returned to MMHC to be trained as a psychiatrist, a
program to which I was thrilled to be accepted. Many famous psychiatrists
had trained there, including Eric Kandel, who later won the Nobel Prize in
Physiology and Medicine. Allan Hobson discovered the brain cells
responsible for the generation of dreams in a lab in the hospital basement
while I trained there, and the first studies on the chemical underpinnings of
depression were also conducted at MMHC. But for many of us residents,
the greatest draw was the patients. W e spent six hours each day with them
and then met as a group with senior psychiatrists to share our observations,
pose our questions, and compete to make the wittiest remarks.
Our great teacher , Elvin Semrad, actively discouraged us from reading
psychiatry textbooks during our first year . (This intellectual starvation diet
may account for the fact that most of us later became voracious readers and
prolific writers.) Semrad did not want our perceptions of reality to become
obscured by the pseudocertainties of psychiatric diagnoses. I remember
asking him once: “What would you call this patient—schizophrenic or
schizoaf fective?” He paused and stroked his chin, apparently in deep
thought. “I think I’d call him Michael McIntyre,” he replied.
Semrad taught us that most human suf fering is related to love and loss
and that the job of therapists is to help people “acknowledge, experience,
and bear” the reality of life—with all its pleasures and heartbreak. “The
greatest sources of our suf fering are the lies we tell ourselves,” he’d say ,
ur ging us to be honest with ourselves about every facet of our experience.
He often said that people can never get better without knowing what they
know and feeling what they feel.
I remember being surprised to hear this distinguished old Harvard
professor confess how comforted he was to feel his wife’ s bum against him
as he fell asleep at night. By disclosing such simple human needs in himself
he helped us recognize how basic they were to our lives. Failure to attend to
them results in a stunted existence, no matter how lofty our thoughts and
worldly accomplishments. Healing, he told us, depends on experiential
knowledge: Y ou can be fully in char ge of your life only if you can
acknowledge the reality of your body , in all its visceral dimensions.
Our profession, however , was moving in a dif ferent direction. In 1968
the American Journal of Psychiatry  had published the results of the study

from the ward where I’d been an attendant. They showed unequivocally
that schizophrenic patients who received drugs alone had a better outcome
than those who talked three times a week with the best therapists in
Boston.3 This study was one of many milestones on a road that gradually
changed how medicine and psychiatry approached psychological problems:
from infinitely variable expressions of intolerable feelings and relationships
to a brain-disease model of discrete “disorders.”
The way medicine approaches human suf fering has always been
determined by the technology available at any given time. Before the
Enlightenment aberrations in behavior were ascribed to God, sin, magic,
witches, and evil spirits. It was only in the nineteenth century that scientists
in France and Germany began to investigate behavior  as an adaptation to
the  complexities of the world. Now a new paradigm was emer ging: Anger ,
lust, pride, greed, avarice, and sloth—as well as all the other problems we
humans have always struggled to manage—were recast as “disorders” that
could be fixed by the administration of appropriate chemicals.4 Many
psychiatrists were relieved and delighted to become “real scientists,” just
like their med school classmates who had laboratories, animal experiments,
expensive equipment, and complicated diagnostic tests, and set aside the
wooly-headed theories of philosophers like Freud and Jung. A major
textbook of psychiatry went so far as to state: “The cause of mental illness
is now considered an aberration of the brain, a chemical imbalance.”5
Like my colleagues, I eagerly embraced the pharmacological
revolution. In 1973 I became the first chief resident in psychopharmacology
at MMHC. I may also have been the first psychiatrist in Boston to
administer lithium to a manic-depressive patient. (I’d read about John
Cade’ s work with lithium in Australia, and I received permission from a
hospital committee to try it.) On lithium a woman who had been manic
every May for the past thirty-five years, and suicidally depressed every
November , stopped cycling and remained stable for the three years she was
under my care. I was also part of the first U.S. research team to test the
antipsychotic Clozaril on chronic patients who were warehoused in the back
wards of the old insane asylums.6 Some of their responses were miraculous:
People who had spent much of their lives locked in their own separate,
terrifying realities were now able to return to their families and

communities; patients mired in darkness and despair started to respond to
the beauty of human contact and the pleasures of work and play . These
amazing results made us optimistic that we could finally conquer human
misery .
Antipsychotic drugs were a major factor in reducing the number of
people living in mental hospitals in the United States, from over 500,000 in
1955 to fewer than 100,000 in 1996.7 For people today who did not know
the world before the advent of these treatments, the change is almost
unimaginable. As a first-year medical student I visited Kankakee State
Hospital in Illinois and saw a burly ward attendant hose down dozens of
filthy , naked, incoherent patients in an unfurnished dayroom supplied with
gutters for the runof f water . This memory now seems more like a nightmare
than like something I witnessed with my own eyes. My first job after
finishing my residency in 1974 was as the second-to-last director of a once-
venerable institution, the Boston State Hospital, which had formerly housed
thousands of patients and been spread over hundreds of acres with dozens
of buildings, including greenhouses, gardens, and workshops—most of
them by then in ruins. During my time there patients were gradually
dispersed into “the community ,” the blanket term for the anonymous
shelters and nursing homes where most of them ended up. (Ironically , the
hospital was started as an “asylum,” a word meaning “sanctuary” that
gradually took on a sinister connotation. It actually did of fer a sheltered
community where everybody knew the patients’ names and idiosyncrasies.)
In 1979, shortly after I went to work at the V A, the Boston State Hospital’ s
gates were permanently locked, and it became a ghost town.
During my time at Boston State I continued to work in the MMHC
psychopharmacology lab, which was now focusing on another direction for
research. In the 1960s scientists at the National Institutes of Health had
begun to develop techniques for isolating and measuring hormones and
neurotransmitters in blood and the brain. Neurotransmitters are chemical
messengers that carry information from neuron to neuron, enabling us to
engage ef fectively with the world.
Now that scientists were finding evidence that abnormal levels of
norepinephrine were associated with depression, and of dopamine with
schizophrenia, there was hope that we could develop drugs that tar get

specific brain abnormalities. That hope was never fully realized, but our
ef forts to measure how drugs could af fect mental symptoms led to another
profound change in the profession. Researchers’ need for a precise and
systematic way to communicate their findings resulted in the development
of the so-called Research Diagnostic Criteria, to which I contributed as a
lowly research assistant. These eventually became the basis for the first
systematic system to diagnose psychiatric problems, the American
Psychiatric Association’ s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disor ders  (DSM), which is commonly referred to as the “bible of
psychiatry .” The foreword to the landmark 1980 DSM-III was appropriately
modest and acknowledged that this diagnostic system was imprecise—so
imprecise that it never should be used for forensic or insurance purposes.8
As we will see, that modesty was tragically short-lived.
INESCAP ABLE SHOCK
Preoccupied with so many lingering questions about traumatic stress, I
became intrigued with the idea that the nascent field of neuroscience could
provide some answers and started to attend the meetings of the American
College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ACNP). In 1984 the ACNP of fered
many fascinating lectures about drug development, but it was not until a
few hours before my scheduled flight back to Boston that I heard a
presentation by Steven Maier of the University of Colorado, who had
collaborated with Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania. His
topic was learned helplessness in animals. Maier and Seligman had
repeatedly administered painful electric shocks to dogs who were trapped in
locked cages. They called this condition “inescapable shock.”9 Being a dog
lover , I realized that I could never have done such research myself, but I
was curious about how this cruelty would af fect the animals.
After administering several courses of electric shock, the researchers
opened the doors of the cages and then shocked the dogs again. A group of
control dogs who had never been shocked before immediately ran away , but
the dogs who had earlier been subjected to inescapable shock made no
attempt to flee, even when the door was wide open—they just lay there,
whimpering and defecating. The mere opportunity to escape does not

necessarily make traumatized animals, or people, take the road to freedom.
Like Maier and Seligman’ s dogs, many traumatized people simply give up.
Rather than risk experimenting with new options they stay stuck in the fear
they know .
I was riveted by Maier ’ s account. What they had done to these poor
dogs was exactly what had happened to my traumatized human patients.
They , too, had been exposed to somebody (or something) who had inflicted
terrible harm on them—harm they had no way of escaping. I made a rapid
mental review of the patients I had treated. Almost all had in some way
been trapped or immobilized, unable to take action to stave of f the
inevitable. Their fight/flight response had been thwarted, and the result was
either extreme agitation or collapse.
Maier and Seligman also found that traumatized dogs secreted much
lar ger amounts of stress hormones than was normal. This supported what
we were beginning to learn about the biological underpinnings of traumatic
stress. A group of young researchers, among them Steve Southwick and
John Krystal at Y ale, Arieh Shalev at Hadassah Medical School in
Jerusalem, Frank Putnam at the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), and Roger Pitman, later at Harvard, were all finding that
traumatized people keep secreting lar ge amounts of stress hormones long
after the actual danger has passed, and Rachel Y ehuda at Mount Sinai in
New Y ork confronted us with her seemingly paradoxical findings that the
levels of the stress hormone cortisol are low in PTSD. Her discoveries only
started to make sense when her research clarified that cortisol puts an end to
the stress response by sending an all-safe signal, and that, in PTSD, the
body’ s stress hormones do, in fact, not return to baseline after the threat has
passed.
Ideally our stress hormone system should provide a lightning-fast
response to threat, but then quickly return us to equilibrium. In PTSD
patients, however , the stress hormone system fails at this balancing act.
Fight/flight/freeze signals continue after the danger is over , and, as in the
case of the dogs, do not return to normal. Instead, the continued secretion of
stress hormones is expressed as agitation and panic and, in the long term,
wreaks havoc with their health.
I missed my plane that day because I had to talk with Steve Maier . His
workshop of fered clues not only about the underlying problems of my

patients but also potential keys to their resolution. For example, he and
Seligman had found that the only way to teach the traumatized dogs to get
of f the electric grids when the doors were open was to repeatedly drag them
out of their cages so they could physically experience how they could get
away . I wondered if we also could help my patients with their fundamental
orientation that there was nothing they could do to defend themselves? Did
my patients also need to have physical  experiences to restore a visceral
sense of control? What if they could be taught to physically move to escape
a potentially threatening situation that was similar to the trauma in which
they had been trapped and immobilized? As I will discuss in the treatment
part 5 of this book, that was one of the conclusions I eventually reached.
Further animal studies involving mice, rats, cats, monkeys, and
elephants brought more intriguing data.10 For example, when researchers
played a loud, intrusive sound, mice that had been raised in a warm nest
with plenty of food scurried home immediately . But another group, raised in
a noisy nest with scarce food supplies, also ran for home, even after
spending time in more pleasant surroundings.1 1
Scared animals return home, regardless of whether home is safe or
frightening. I thought about my patients with abusive families who kept
going back to be hurt again. Are traumatized people condemned to seek
refuge in what is familiar? If so, why , and is it possible to help them
become attached to places and activities that are safe and pleasurable?12
ADDICTED T O TRAUMA: THE P AIN OF PLEASURE AND
THE PLEASURE OF P AIN
One of the things that struck my colleague Mark Greenber g and me when
we ran therapy groups for V ietnam combat veterans was how , despite their
feelings of horror and grief, many of them seemed to come to life when
they talked about their helicopter crashes and their dying comrades.
(Former New Y ork T imes  correspondent Chris Hedges, who covered a
number of brutal conflicts, entitled his book W ar Is a For ce That Gives Us
Meaning .13) Many traumatized people seem to seek out experiences that
would repel most of us,14 and patients often complain about a vague sense

of emptiness and boredom when they are not angry , under duress, or
involved in some dangerous activity .
My patient Julia was brutally raped at gunpoint in a hotel room at age
sixteen. Shortly thereafter she got involved with a violent pimp who
prostituted her . He regularly beat her up. She was repeatedly jailed for
prostitution, but she always went back to her pimp. Finally her grandparents
intervened and paid for an intense rehab program. After she successfully
completed inpatient treatment, she started working as a receptionist and
taking courses at a local college. In her sociology class she wrote a term
paper about the liberating possibilities of prostitution, for which she read
the memoirs of several famous prostitutes. She gradually dropped all her
other courses. A brief relationship with a classmate quickly went sour—he
bored her to tears, she said, and she was repelled by his boxer shorts. She
then picked up an addict on the subway who first beat her up and then
started to stalk her . She finally became motivated to return to treatment
when she was once again severely beaten.
Freud had a term for such traumatic reenactments: “the compulsion to
repeat.” He and many of his followers believed that reenactments were an
unconscious attempt to get control over a painful situation and that they
eventually could lead to mastery and resolution. There is no evidence for
that theory—repetition leads only to further pain and self-hatred. In fact,
even reliving the trauma repeatedly in therapy may reinforce preoccupation
and fixation.
Mark Greenber g and I decided to learn more about attractors—the
things that draw us, motivate us, and make us feel alive. Normally attractors
are meant to make us feel better . So, why are so many people attracted to
dangerous or painful situations? W e eventually found a study that explained
how activities that cause fear or pain can later become thrilling
experiences.15 In the 1970s Richard Solomon of the University of
Pennsylvania had shown that the body learns to adjust to all sorts of stimuli.
W e may get hooked on recreational drugs because they right away make us
feel so good, but activities like sauna bathing, marathon running, or
parachute jumping, which initially cause discomfort and even terror , can
ultimately become very enjoyable. This gradual adjustment signals that a
new chemical balance has been established within the body , so that

marathon runners, say , get a sense of well-being and exhilaration from
pushing their bodies to the limit.
At this point, just as with drug addiction, we start to crave the activity
and experience withdrawal when it’ s not available. In the long run people
become more preoccupied with the pain of withdrawal than the activity
itself. This theory could explain why some people hire someone to beat
them, or burn themselves with cigarettes. or why they are only attracted to
people who hurt them. Fear and aversion, in some perverse way , can be
transformed into pleasure.
Solomon hypothesized that endorphins—the morphinelike chemicals
that the brain secretes in response to stress—play a role in the paradoxical
addictions he described. I thought of his theory again when my library habit
led me to a paper titled “Pain in Men W ounded in Battle,” published in
1946. Having observed that 75 percent of severely wounded soldiers on the
Italian front did not request morphine, a sur geon by the name of Henry K.
Beecher speculated that “strong emotions can block pain.”16
W ere Beecher ’ s observations relevant to people with PTSD? Mark
Greenber g, Roger Pitman, Scott Orr , and I decided to ask eight V ietnam
combat veterans if they would be willing to take a standard pain test while
they watched scenes from a number of movies. The first clip we showed
was from Oliver Stone’ s graphically violent Platoon  (1986) , and while it
ran we measured how long the veterans could keep their right hands in a
bucket of ice water . W e then repeated this process with a peaceful (and
long-for gotten) movie clip. Seven of the eight veterans kept their hands in
the painfully cold water 30 percent longer during Platoon . W e then
calculated that the amount of analgesia produced by watching fifteen
minutes of a combat movie was equivalent to that produced by being
injected with eight milligrams of morphine, about the same dose a person
would receive in an emer gency room for crushing chest pain.
W e concluded that Beecher ’ s speculation that “strong emotions can
block pain” was the result of the release of morphinelike substances
manufactured in the brain. This suggested that for many traumatized
people, reexposure to stress might provide a similar relief from anxiety .17 It
was an interesting experiment, but it did not fully explain why Julia kept
going back to her violent pimp.

SOOTHING THE BRAIN
The 1985 ACNP meeting was, if possible, even more thought provoking
than the previous year ’ s session. Kings College professor Jef frey Gray gave
a talk about the amygdala, a cluster of brain cells that determines whether a
sound, image, or body sensation is perceived as a threat. Gray’ s data
showed that the sensitivity of the amygdala depended, at least in part, on the
amount of the neurotransmitter serotonin in that part of the brain. Animals
with low serotonin levels were hyperreactive to stressful stimuli (like loud
sounds), while higher levels of serotonin dampened their fear system,
making them less likely to become aggressive or frozen in response to
potential threats.18
That struck me as an important finding: My patients were always
blowing up in response to small provocations and felt devastated by the
slightest rejection. I became fascinated by the possible role of serotonin in
PTSD. Other researchers had shown that dominant male monkeys had much
higher levels of brain serotonin than lower -ranking animals but that their
serotonin levels dropped when they were prevented from maintaining eye
contact with the monkeys they had once lorded over . In contrast, low-
ranking monkeys who were given serotonin supplements emer ged from the
pack to assume leadership.19 The social environment interacts with brain
chemistry . Manipulating a monkey into a lower position in the dominance
hierarchy made his serotonin drop, while chemically enhancing serotonin
elevated the rank of former subordinates.
The implications for traumatized people were obvious. Like Gray’ s
low-serotonin animals, they were hyperreactive, and their ability to cope
socially was often compromised. If we could find ways to increase brain
serotonin levels, perhaps we could address both problems simultaneously .
At that same 1985 meeting I learned that drug companies were developing
two new products to do precisely that, but since neither was yet available, I
experimented briefly with the health-food-store supplement L-tryptophan,
which is a chemical precursor of serotonin in the body . (The results were
disappointing.)  One of the drugs under investigation never made it to the
market. The other was fluoxetine, which, under the brand name Prozac,
became one of the most successful psychoactive drugs ever created.

On Monday , February 8, 1988, Prozac was released by the drug
company Eli Lilly . The first patient I saw that day was a young woman with
a horrendous history of childhood abuse who was now struggling with
bulimia—she basically spent much of her life bingeing and pur ging. I gave
her a prescription for this brand-new drug, and when she returned on
Thursday she said, “I’ve had a very dif ferent last few days: I ate when I was
hungry , and the rest of the time I did my schoolwork.” This was one of the
most dramatic statements I had ever heard in my of fice.
On Friday I saw another patient to whom I’d given Prozac the previous
Monday . She was a chronically depressed mother of two school-aged
children, preoccupied with her failures as a mother and wife and
overwhelmed by demands from the parents who had badly mistreated her as
a child. After four days on Prozac she asked me if she could skip her
appointment the following Monday , which was Presidents’ Day . “After all,”
she explained, “I’ve never taken my kids skiing—my husband always does
—and they are of f that day . It would really be nice for them to have some
good memories of us having fun together .”
This was a patient who had always struggled merely to get through the
day . After her appointment I called someone I knew at Eli Lilly and said,
“Y ou have a drug that helps people to be in the present, instead of being
locked in the past.” Lilly later gave me a small grant to study the ef fects of
Prozac on PTSD in sixty-four people—twenty-two women and forty-two
men—the first study of the ef fects of this new class of drugs on PTSD. Our
T rauma Clinic team enrolled thirty-three nonveterans and my collaborators,
former colleagues at the V A, enrolled thirty-one combat veterans. For eight
weeks half of each group received Prozac and the other half a placebo. The
study was blinded: Neither we nor the patients knew which substance they
were taking, so that our preconceptions could not skew our assessments.
Everyone in the study—even those who had received the placebo—
improved, at least to some degree. Most treatment studies of PTSD find a
significant placebo ef fect. People who screw up their courage to participate
in a study for which they aren’ t paid, in which they’re repeatedly poked
with needles, and in which they have only a fifty-fifty chance of getting an
active drug are intrinsically motivated to solve their problem. Maybe their
reward is only the attention paid to them, the opportunity to respond to

questions about how they feel and think. But maybe the mother ’ s kisses that
soothe her child’ s scrapes are “just” a placebo as well.
Prozac worked significantly better than the placebo for the patients
from the T rauma Clinic. They slept more soundly; they had more control
over their emotions and were less preoccupied with the past than those who
received a sugar pill.20 Surprisingly , however , the Prozac had no ef fect at all
on the combat veterans at the V A—their PTSD symptoms were unchanged.
These results have held true for most subsequent pharmacological studies
on veterans: While a few have shown modest improvements, most have not
benefited at all. I have never been able to explain this, and I cannot accept
the most common explanation: that receiving a pension or disability
benefits prevents people from getting better . After all, the amygdala knows
nothing of pensions—it just detects threats.
Nonetheless, medications such as Prozac and related drugs like Zoloft,
Celexa, Cymbalta, and Paxil, have made a substantial contribution to the
treatment of trauma-related disorders. In our Prozac study we used the
Rorschach test to measure how traumatized people perceive their
surroundings. These data gave us an important clue to how this class of
drugs (formally known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs)
might work. Before taking Prozac these patients’ emotions controlled their
reactions. I think of a Dutch patient, for example (not in the Prozac study)
who came to see me for treatment for a childhood rape and who was
convinced that I would rape her as soon as she heard my Dutch accent.
Prozac made a radical dif ference: It gave PTSD patients a sense of
perspective21 and helped them to gain considerable control over their
impulses. Jef frey Gray must have been right: When their serotonin levels
rose, many of my patients became less reactive.
THE TRIUMPH OF PHARMACOLOGY
It did not take long for pharmacology to revolutionize psychiatry . Drugs
gave doctors a greater sense of ef ficacy and provided a tool beyond talk
therapy . Drugs also produced income and profits. Grants from the
pharmaceutical industry provided us with laboratories filled with ener getic
graduate students and sophisticated instruments. Psychiatry departments,

which had always been located in the basements of hospitals, started to
move up, both in terms of location and prestige.
One symbol of this change occurred at MMHC, where in the early
1990s the hospital’ s swimming pool was paved over to make space for a
laboratory , and the indoor basketball court was carved up into cubicles for
the new medication clinic. For decades doctors and patients had
democratically shared the pleasures of splashing in the pool and passing
balls down the court. I’d spent hours in the gym with patients back when I
was a ward attendant. It was the one place where we all could restore a
sense of physical well-being, an island in the midst of the misery we faced
every day . Now it had become a place for patients to “get fixed.”
The drug revolution that started out with so much promise may in the
end have done as much harm as good. The theory that mental illness is
caused primarily by chemical imbalances in the brain that can be corrected
by specific drugs has become broadly accepted, by the media and the public
as well as by the medical profession.22 In many places drugs have displaced
therapy and enabled patients to suppress their problems without addressing
the underlying issues. Antidepressants can make all the dif ference in the
world in helping with day-to-day functioning, and if it comes to a choice
between taking a sleeping pill and drinking yourself into a stupor every
night to get a few hours of sleep, there is no question which is preferable.
For people who are exhausted from trying to make it on their own through
yoga classes, workout routines, or simply toughing it out, medications often
can bring life-saving relief. The SSRIs can be very helpful in making
traumatized people less enslaved by their emotions, but they should only be
considered adjuncts in their overall treatment.23
After conducting numerous studies of medications for PTSD, I have
come to realize that psychiatric medications have a serious downside, as
they may deflect attention from dealing with the underlying issues. The
brain-disease model takes control over people’ s fate out of their own hands
and puts doctors and insurance companies in char ge of fixing their
problems.
Over the past three decades psychiatric medications have become a
mainstay in our culture, with dubious consequences. Consider the case of
antidepressants. If they were indeed as ef fective as we have been led to

believe, depression should by now have become a minor issue in our
society . Instead, even as antidepressant use continues to increase, it has not
made a dent in hospital admissions for depression. The number of people
treated for depression has tripled over the past two decades, and one in ten
Americans now take antidepressants.24
The new generation of antipsychotics, such as Abilify , Risperdal,
Zyprexa, and Seroquel, are the top-selling drugs in the United States. In
2012 the public spent $1,526,228,000 on Abilify , more than on any other
medication. Number three was Cymbalta, an antidepressant that sold well
over a billion dollars’ worth of pills,25 even though it has never been shown
to be superior to older antidepressants like Prozac, for which much cheaper
generics are available. Medicaid, the government health program for the
poor , spends more on antipsychotics than on any other class of drugs.26 In
2008, the most recent year for which complete data are available, it funded
$3.6 billion for antipsychotic medications, up from $1.65 billion in 1999.
The number of people under the age of twenty receiving Medicaid-funded
prescriptions for antipsychotic drugs tripled between 1999 and 2008. On
November 4, 2013, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay more than $2.2
billion in criminal and civil fines to settle accusations that it had improperly
promoted the antipsychotic drug Risperdal to older adults, children, and
people with developmental disabilities.27 But nobody is holding the doctors
who prescribed them accountable.
Half a million children in the United States currently take antipsychotic
drugs. Children from low-income families are four times as likely as
privately insured children to receive antipsychotic medicines. These
medications often are used to make abused and neglected children more
tractable. In 2008 19,045 children age five and under were prescribed
antipsychotics through Medicaid.28 One study , based on Medicaid data in
thirteen states, found that 12.4 percent of children in foster care received
antipsychotics, compared with 1.4 percent of Medicaid-eligible children in
general.29 These medications make children more manageable and less
aggressive, but they also interfere with motivation, play , and curiosity ,
which are indispensable for maturing into a well-functioning and
contributing member of society . Children who take them are also at risk of
becoming morbidly obese and developing diabetes. Meanwhile, drug

overdoses involving a combination of psychiatric and pain medications
continue to rise.30
Because drugs have become so profitable, major medical journals
rarely publish studies on nondrug treatments of mental health problems.31
Practitioners who explore treatments are typically mar ginalized as
“alternative.” Studies of nondrug treatments are rarely funded unless they
involve so-called manualized protocols, where patients and therapists go
through narrowly prescribed sequences that allow little fine-tuning to
individual patients’ needs. Mainstream medicine is firmly committed to a
better life through chemistry , and the fact that we can actually change our
own physiology and inner equilibrium by means other than drugs is rarely

ADAPT A TION OR DISEASE?
The brain-disease model overlooks four fundamental truths: (1) our
capacity to destroy one another is matched by our capacity to heal one
another . Restoring relationships and community is central to restoring well-
being; (2) language gives us the power to change ourselves and others by
communicating our experiences, helping us to define what we know , and
finding a common sense of meaning; (3) we have the ability to regulate our
own physiology , including some of the so-called involuntary functions of
the body and brain, through such basic activities as breathing, moving, and
touching; and (4) we can change social conditions to create environments in
which children and adults can feel safe and where they can thrive.
When we ignore these quintessential dimensions of humanity , we
deprive people of ways to heal from trauma and restore their autonomy .
Being a patient, rather than a participant in one’ s healing process, separates
suf fering people from their community and alienates them from an inner
sense of self. Given the limitations of drugs, I started to wonder if we could
find more natural ways to help people deal with their post-traumatic
responses.

If we could look through the skull into the brain of a consciously
thinking person, and if the place of optimal excitability were
luminous, then we should see playing over the cerebral surface, a
bright spot, with fantastic, waving borders constantly fluctuating in
size and form, and surrounded by darkness, more or less deep,
covering the rest of the hemisphere.

n the early 1990s novel brain-imaging techniques opened up undreamed-
of capacities to gain a sophisticated understanding about the way the
brain processes information. Gigantic multimillion-dollar machines based
on advanced physics and computer technology rapidly made neuroscience
into one of the most popular areas for research. Positron emission
tomography (PET) and, later , functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) enabled scientists to visualize how dif ferent parts of the brain are
activated when people are engaged in certain tasks or when they remember
events from the past. For the first time we could watch the brain as it

processed memories, sensations, and emotions and begin to map the circuits
of mind and consciousness. The earlier technology of measuring brain
chemicals like serotonin or norepinephrine had enabled scientists to look at
what fueled  neural activity , which is a bit like trying to understand a car ’ s
engine by studying gasoline. Neuroimaging made it possible to see inside
the engine. By doing so it has also transformed our understanding of
trauma.
Harvard Medical School was and is at the forefront of the neuroscience
revolution, and in 1994 a young psychiatrist, Scott Rauch, was appointed as
the first director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Neuroimaging
Laboratory . After considering the most relevant questions that this new
technology could answer and reading some articles I had written, Scott
asked me whether I thought we could study what happens in the brains of
people who have flashbacks.
I had just finished a study on how trauma is remembered  (to be
discussed in chapter 12), in which participants repeatedly told me how
upsetting it was to be suddenly hijacked by images, feelings, and sounds
from the past. When several said they wished they knew what trick their
brains were playing on them during these flashbacks, I asked eight of them
if they would be willing to return to the clinic and lie still inside a scanner
(an entirely new experience that I described in detail) while we re-created a
scene from the painful events that haunted them. T o my surprise, all eight
agreed, many of them expressing their hope that what we learned from their
suf fering could help other people.
My research assistant, Rita Fisler , who was working with us prior to
entering Harvard Medical School, sat down with every participant and
carefully constructed a script that re-created their trauma moment to
moment. W e deliberately tried to collect just isolated fragments of their
experience—particular images, sounds, and feelings—rather than the entire
story , because that is how trauma is experienced. Rita also asked the
participants to describe a scene where they felt safe and in control. One
person described her morning routine; another , sitting on the porch of a
farmhouse in V ermont overlooking the hills. W e would use this script for a
second scan, to provide a baseline measurement.
After the participants checked the scripts for accuracy (reading silently ,
which is less overwhelming than hearing or speaking), Rita made a voice

recording that would be played back to them while they were in the scanner .
A typical script:
Y ou are six years old and getting ready for bed. Y ou hear your
mother and father yelling at each other . Y ou are frightened and
your stomach is in a knot. Y ou and your younger brother and sister
are huddled at the top of the stairs. Y ou look over the banister and
see your father holding your mother ’ s arms while she struggles to
free herself. Y our mother is crying, spitting and hissing like an
animal. Y our face is flushed and you feel hot all over . When your
mother frees herself, she runs to the dining room and breaks a very
expensive Chinese vase. Y ou yell at your parents to stop, but they
ignore you. Y our mom runs upstairs and you hear her breaking the
TV . Y our little brother and sister try to get her to hide in the closet.
Y our heart pounds and you are trembling.
At this first session we explained the purpose of the radioactive oxygen
the participants would be breathing: As any part of the brain became more
or less metabolically active, its rate of oxygen consumption would
immediately change, which would be picked up by the scanner . W e would
monitor their blood pressure and heart rate throughout the procedure, so
that these physiological signs could be compared with brain activity .
Several days later the participants came to the imaging lab. Marsha, a
forty-year -old schoolteacher from a suburb outside of Boston, was the first
volunteer to be scanned. Her script took her back to the day , thirteen years
earlier , when she picked up her five-year -old daughter , Melissa, from day
camp. As they drove of f, Marsha heard a persistent beeping, indicating that
Melissa’ s seatbelt was not properly fastened. When Marsha reached over to
adjust the belt, she ran a red light. Another car smashed into hers from the
right, instantly killing her daughter . In the ambulance on the way to the
emer gency room, the seven-month-old fetus Marsha was carrying also died.
Overnight Marsha had changed from a cheerful woman who was the
life of the party into a haunted and depressed person filled with self-blame.
She moved from classroom teaching into school administration, because
working directly with children had become intolerable—as for many

parents who have lost children, their happy laughter had become a powerful
trigger .  Even hiding behind her paperwork she could barely make it through
the day . In a futile attempt to keep her feelings at bay , she coped by working
day and night.
I was standing outside the scanner as Marsha underwent the procedure
and could follow her physiological reactions on a monitor . The moment we
turned on the tape recorder , her heart started to race, and her blood pressure
jumped. Simply hearing the script similar activated the same physiological
responses that had occurred during the accident thirteen years earlier . After
the recorded script concluded and Marsha’ s heart rate and blood pressure
returned to normal,  we played her second script: getting out of bed and
brushing her teeth. This time her heart rate and blood pressure did not
change.
As she emer ged from the scanner , Marsha looked defeated, drawn out,
and frozen. Her breathing was shallow , her eyes were opened wide, and her
shoulders were hunched—the very image of vulnerability and
defenselessness. W e tried to comfort her , but I wondered if whatever we
discovered would be worth the price of her distress.
Picturing the brain on trauma.  Bright spots in (A) the limbic brain, and (B) the visual cortex,
show heightened activation. In drawing (C) the brain’ s speech center shows markedly
decreased activation.
After all eight participants completed the procedure, Scott Rauch went
to work with his mathematicians and statisticians to create composite

images that compared the arousal created by a flashback with the brain in
neutral. After a few weeks he sent me the results, which you see above. I
taped the scans up on the refrigerator in my kitchen, and for the next few
months I stared at them every evening. It occurred to me that this was how
early astronomers must have felt when they peered through a telescope at a
new constellation.
There were some puzzling dots and colors on the scan, but the biggest
area of brain activation—a lar ge red spot in the right lower center of the
brain, which is the limbic area, or emotional brain—came as no surprise. It
was already well known that intense emotions activate the limbic system, in
particular an area within it called the amygdala. W e depend on the
amygdala to warn us of impending danger and to activate the body’ s stress
response. Our study clearly showed that when traumatized people are
presented with images, sounds, or thoughts related to their particular
experience, the amygdala reacts with alarm—even, as in Marsha’ s case,
thirteen years after the event. Activation of this fear center triggers the
cascade of stress hormones and nerve impulses that drive up blood pressure,
heart rate, and oxygen intake—preparing the body for fight or flight.1 The
monitors attached to Marsha’ s arms recorded this physiological state of
frantic arousal, even though she never totally lost track of the fact that she
was resting quietly in the scanner .
SPEECHLESS HORROR
Our most surprising finding was a white spot in the left frontal lobe of the
cortex, in a region called Broca’ s area. In this case the change in color
meant that there was a significant decrease in that part of the brain. Broca’ s
area is one of the speech centers of the brain, which is often af fected in
stroke patients when the blood supply to that region is cut of f. W ithout a
functioning Broca’ s area, you cannot put your thoughts and feelings into
words. Our scans showed that Broca’ s area went of fline whenever a
flashback was triggered. In other words, we had visual proof that the ef fects
of trauma are not necessarily dif ferent from—and can overlap with—the
ef fects of physical lesions like strokes.

All trauma is preverbal. Shakespeare captures this state of speechless
terror in Macbeth , after the murdered king’ s body is discovered :  “Oh
horror! horror! horror! T ongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!” Under extreme conditions
people may scream obscenities, call for their mothers, howl in terror , or
simply shut down. V ictims of assaults and accidents sit mute and frozen in
emer gency rooms; traumatized children “lose their tongues” and refuse to
speak. Photographs of combat soldiers show hollow-eyed men staring
mutely into a void.
Even years later traumatized people often have enormous dif ficulty
telling other people what has happened to them. Their bodies reexperience
terror , rage, and helplessness, as well as the impulse to fight or flee, but
these feelings are almost impossible to articulate. T rauma by nature drives
us to the edge of comprehension, cutting us of f from language based on
common experience or an imaginable past.
This doesn’ t mean that people can’ t talk about a tragedy that has
befallen them. Sooner or later most survivors, like the veterans in chapter 1,
come up with what many of them call their “cover story” that of fers some
explanation for their symptoms and behavior for public consumption. These
stories, however , rarely capture the inner truth of the experience. It is
enormously dif ficult to or ganize one’ s traumatic experiences into a coherent
account—a narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Even a
seasoned reporter like the famed CBS correspondent Ed Murrow struggled
to convey the atrocities he saw when the Nazi concentration camp
Buchenwald was liberated in 1945: “I pray you believe what I have said. I
reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it I have no
words.”
When words fail, haunting images capture the experience and return as
nightmares and flashbacks.  In contrast to the deactivation of Broca’ s area,
another region, Brodmann’ s area 19, lit up in our participants. This is a
region in the visual cortex that registers images when they first enter the
brain. W e were surprised to see brain activation in this area so long after the
original experience of the trauma. Under ordinary conditions raw images
registered in area 19 are rapidly dif fused to other brain areas that interpret
the meaning of what has been seen. Once again, we were witnessing a brain
region rekindled as if the trauma were actually occurring.

As we will see in chapter 12, which discusses memory , other
unprocessed sense fragments of trauma, like sounds and smells and physical
sensations, are also registered separately from the story itself. Similar
sensations often trigger a flashback that brings them back into
consciousness, apparently unmodified by the passage of time.
SHIFTING T O ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN
The scans also revealed that during flashbacks, our subjects’ brains lit up
only on the right side. T oday there’ s a huge body of scientific and popular
literature about the dif ference between the right and left brains. Back in the
early nineties I had heard that some people had begun to divide the world
between left-brainers (rational, logical people) and right-brainers (the
intuitive, artistic ones), but I hadn’ t paid much attention to this idea.
However , our scans clearly showed that images of past trauma activate the
right hemisphere of the brain and deactivate the left.
W e now know that the two halves of the brain do speak dif ferent
languages. The right is intuitive, emotional, visual, spatial, and tactual, and
the left is linguistic, sequential, and analytical. While the left half of the
brain does all the talking, the right half of the brain carries the music of
experience. It communicates through facial expressions and body language
and by making the sounds of love and sorrow: by singing, swearing, crying,
dancing, or mimicking. The right brain is the first to develop in the womb,
and it carries the nonverbal communication between mothers and infants.
W e know the left hemisphere has come online when children start to
understand language and learn how to speak. This enables them to name
things, compare them, understand their interrelations, and begin to
communicate their own unique, subjective experiences to others.
The left and right sides of the brain also process the imprints of the past
in dramatically dif ferent ways.2 The left brain remembers facts, statistics,
and the vocabulary of events. W e call on it to explain our experiences and
put them in order . The right brain stores memories of sound, touch, smell,
and the emotions they evoke. It reacts automatically to voices, facial
features, and gestures and places experienced in the past. What it recalls
feels like intuitive truth—the way things are. Even as we enumerate a loved

one’ s virtues to a friend, our feelings may be more deeply stirred by how
her face recalls the aunt we loved at age four .3
Under ordinary circumstances the two sides of the brain work together
more or less smoothly , even in people who might be said to favor one side
over the other . However , having one side or the other shut down, even
temporarily , or having one side cut of f entirely (as sometimes happened in
early brain sur gery) is disabling.
Deactivation of the left hemisphere has a direct impact on the capacity
to or ganize experience into logical sequences and to translate our shifting
feelings and perceptions into words. (Broca’ s area, which blacks out during
flashbacks, is on the left side.) W ithout sequencing we can’ t identify cause
and ef fect, grasp the long-term ef fects of our actions, or create coherent
plans for the future. People who are very upset sometimes say they are
“losing their minds.” In technical terms they are experiencing the loss of
executive functioning.
When something reminds traumatized people of the past, their right
brain reacts as if the traumatic event were happening in the present. But
because their left brain is not working very well, they may not be aware that
they are reexperiencing and reenacting the past—they are just furious,
terrified, enraged, ashamed, or frozen. After the emotional storm passes,
they may look for something or somebody to blame for it. They behaved
the way they did way because you  were ten minutes late, or because you
burned the potatoes, or because you  “never listen to me.” Of course, most of
us have done this from time to time, but when we cool down, we hopefully
can admit our mistake. T rauma interferes with this kind of awareness, and,
over time, our research demonstrated why .
STUCK IN FIGHT OR FLIGHT
What had happened to Marsha in the scanner gradually started to make
sense. Thirteen years after her tragedy we had activated the sensations—the
sounds and images from the accident—that were still stored in her memory .
When these sensations came to the surface, they activated her alarm system,
which caused her to react as if she were back in the hospital being told that
her daughter had died. The passage of thirteen years was erased. Her

sharply increased heart rate and blood pressure readings reflected her
physiological state of frantic alarm.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones that are critical to help us fight back
or flee in the face of danger . Increased adrenaline was responsible for our
participants’ dramatic rise in heart rate and blood pressure while listening to
their trauma narrative. Under normal conditions people react to a threat
with a temporary increase in their stress hormones. As soon as the threat is
over , the hormones dissipate and the body returns to normal. The stress
hormones of traumatized people, in contrast, take much longer to return to
baseline and spike quickly and disproportionately in response to mildly
stressful stimuli. The insidious ef fects of constantly elevated stress
hormones include memory and attention problems, irritability , and sleep
disorders. They also contribute to many long-term health issues, depending
on which body system is most vulnerable in a particular individual.
W e now know that there is another possible response to threat, which
our scans aren’ t yet capable of measuring. Some people simply go into
denial: Their bodies register the threat, but their conscious minds go on as if
nothing has happened. However , even though the mind may learn to ignore
the messages from the emotional brain, the alarm signals don’ t stop. The
emotional brain keeps working, and stress hormones keep sending signals
to the muscles to tense for action or immobilize in collapse. The physical
ef fects on the or gans go on unabated until they demand notice when they
are expressed as illness. Medications, drugs, and alcohol can also
temporarily dull or obliterate unbearable sensations and feelings. But the
body continues to keep the score.
W e can interpret what happened to Marsha in the scanner from several
dif ferent perspectives, each of which has implications for treatment. W e can
focus on the neurochemical and physiological disruptions that were so
evident and make a case that she is suf fering from a biochemical imbalance
that is reactivated whenever she is reminded of her daughter ’ s death. W e
might then search for a drug or a combination of drugs that would damp
down the reaction or , in the best case, restore her chemical equilibrium.
Based on the results of our scans, some of my colleagues at MGH began
investigating drugs that might make people less responsive to the ef fects of
elevated adrenaline.

W e can also make a strong case that Marsha is hypersensitized to her
memories of the past and that the best treatment would be some form of
desensitization.4 After repeatedly rehearsing the details of the trauma with a
therapist, her biological responses might become muted, so that she could
realize and remember that “that was then and this is now ,” rather than
reliving the experience over and over .
For a hundred years or more, every textbook of psychology and
psychotherapy has advised that some method of talking about distressing
feelings can resolve them. However , as we’ve seen, the experience of
trauma itself gets in the way of being able to do that. No matter how much
insight and understanding we develop, the rational brain is basically
impotent to talk the emotional brain out of its own reality . I am continually
impressed by how dif ficult it is for people who have gone through the
unspeakable to convey the essence of their experience. It is so much easier
for them to talk about what has been done to them—to tell a story of
victimization and revenge—than to notice, feel, and put into words the
reality of their internal experience.
Our scans had revealed how their dread persisted and could be
triggered by multiple aspects of daily experience. They had not integrated
their experience into the ongoing stream of their life. They continued to be
“there” and did not know how to be “here”—fully alive in the present.
Three years after being a participant in our study Marsha came to see
me as a patient. I successfully treated her with EMDR, the subject of
chapter 15.

Prior to the advent of brain, there was no color and no sound in the
universe, nor was there any flavor or aroma and probably little
sense and no feeling or emotion. Before brains the universe was
also free of pain and anxiety .
—Roger Sperry1
n September 1 1, 2001, five-year -old Noam Saul witnessed the first
passenger plane slam into the W orld T rade Center from the windows
of his first-grade classroom at PS 234, less than 1,500 feet away . He and his
classmates ran with their teacher down the stairs to the lobby , where most
of them were reunited with parents who had dropped them of f at school just
moments earlier . Noam, his older brother , and their dad were three of the
tens of thousands of people who ran for their lives through the rubble, ash,
and smoke of lower Manhattan that morning.
T en days later I visited his family , who are friends of mine, and that
evening his parents and I went for a walk in the eerie darkness through the
still-smoking pit where T ower One once stood, making our way among the
rescue crews who were working around the clock under the blazing klieg
lights. When we returned home, Noam was still awake, and he showed me a
picture that he had drawn at 9:00 a.m. on September 12. The drawing
depicted what he had seen the day before: an airplane slamming into the

tower , a ball of fire, firefighters, and people jumping from the tower ’ s
windows. But at the bottom of the picture he had drawn something else: a
black circle at the foot of the buildings. I had no idea what it was, so I asked
him. “A trampoline,” he replied. What was a trampoline doing there? Noam
explained, “So that the next time when people have to jump they will be
safe.” I was stunned: This five-year -old boy , a witness to unspeakable
mayhem and disaster just twenty-four hours before he made that drawing,
had used his imagination to process what he had seen and begin to go on
with his life.
Noam was fortunate. His entire family was unharmed, he had grown up
surrounded by love, and he was able to grasp that the tragedy they had
witnessed had come to an end. During disasters young children usually take
their cues from their parents. As long as their caregivers remain calm and
responsive to their needs, they often survive terrible incidents without
serious psychological scars.
Five-year -old Noam’ s drawing made after he witnessed the W orld T rade Center attack on
9/1 1.  He reproduced the image that haunted so many survivors—people jumping to escape
from the inferno—but with a life-saving addition: a trampoline at the bottom of the collapsing
building.

But Noam’ s experience allows us to see in outline two critical aspects
of the adaptive response to threat that is basic to human survival. At the
time the disaster occurred, he was able to take an active role by running
away from it, thus becoming an agent in his own rescue. And once he had
reached the safety of home, the alarm bells in his brain and body quieted.
This freed his mind to make some sense of what had happened and even to
imagine a creative alternative to what he had seen—a lifesaving trampoline.
In contrast to Noam, traumatized people become stuck, stopped in their
growth because they can’ t integrate new experiences into their lives. I was
very moved when the veterans of Patton’ s army gave me a W orld W ar II
army-issue watch for Christmas, but it was a sad memento of the year their
lives had ef fectively stopped: 1944. Being traumatized means continuing to
or ganize your life as if the trauma were still going on—unchanged and
immutable—as every new encounter or event is contaminated by the past.
T rauma af fects the entire human or ganism—body , mind, and brain. In PTSD the body
continues to defend against a threat that belongs to the past. Healing from PTSD means being
able to terminate this continued stress mobilization and restoring the entire or ganism to safety .
After trauma the world is experienced with a dif ferent nervous system.
The survivor ’ s ener gy now becomes focused on suppressing inner chaos, at

the expense of spontaneous involvement in their lives. These attempts to
maintain control over unbearable physiological reactions can result in a
whole range of physical symptoms, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue,
and other autoimmune diseases. This explains why it is critical for trauma
treatment to engage the entire or ganism, body , mind, and brain.
ORGANIZED T O SUR VIVE
This illustration on page 53 shows the whole-body response to threat.
When the brain’ s alarm system is turned on, it automatically triggers
preprogrammed physical escape plans in the oldest parts of the brain. As in
other animals, the nerves and chemicals that make up our basic brain
structure have a direct connection with our body . When the old brain takes
over , it partially shuts down the higher brain, our conscious mind, and
propels the body to run, hide, fight, or , on occasion, freeze. By the time we
are fully aware of our situation, our body may already be on the move. If
the fight/flight/freeze response is successful and we escape the danger , we
recover our internal equilibrium and gradually “regain our senses.”

Effective action versus immobilization.  Ef fective action (the result of fight/flight) ends the
threat. Immobilization keeps the body in a state of inescapable shock and learned helplessness.
Faced with danger people automatically secrete stress hormones to fuel resistance and escape.
Brain and body are programmed to run for home, where safety can be restored and stress
hormones can come to rest. In these strapped-down men who are being evacuated far from
home after Hurricane Katrina stress hormone levels remain elevated and are turned against the
survivors, stimulating ongoing fear , depression, rage, and physical disease.
If for some reason the normal response is blocked — for example, when
people are held down, trapped, or otherwise prevented from taking ef fective
action, be it in a war zone, a car accident, domestic violence, or a rape—the
brain keeps secreting stress chemicals, and the brain’ s electrical circuits
continue to fire in vain.2 Long after the actual event has passed, the brain
may keep sending signals to the body to escape a threat that no longer
exists. Since at least 1889, when the French psychologist Pierre Janet
published the first scientific account of traumatic stress,3 it has been
recognized that trauma survivors are prone to “continue the action, or rather
the (futile) attempt at action, which began when the thing happened.” Being
able to move and do  something to protect oneself is a critical factor in

determining whether or not a horrible experience will leave long-lasting
scars.
In this chapter I’m going to go deeper into the brain’ s response to
trauma. The more neuroscience discovers about the brain, the more we
realize that it is a vast network of interconnected parts or ganized to help us
survive and flourish. Knowing how these parts work together is essential to
understanding how trauma af fects every part of the human or ganism and
can serve as an indispensable guide to resolving traumatic stress.
THE BRAIN FROM BOTT OM T O T OP
The most important job of the brain is to ensure our survival, even under the
most miserable conditions. Everything else is secondary . In order to do that,
brains need to: (1) generate internal signals that register what our bodies
need, such as food, rest, protection, sex, and shelter; (2) create a map of the
world to point us where to go to satisfy those needs; (3) generate the
necessary ener gy and actions to get us there; (4) warn us of dangers and
opportunities along the way; and (5) adjust our actions based on the
requirements of the moment.4 And since we human beings are mammals,
creatures that can only survive and thrive in groups, all of these imperatives
require coordination and collaboration. Psychological problems occur when
our internal signals don’ t work, when our maps don’ t lead us where we
need to go, when we are too paralyzed to move, when our actions do not
correspond to our needs, or when our relationships break down. Every brain
structure that I discuss has a role to play in these essential functions, and as
we will see, trauma can interfere with every one of them.
Our rational, cognitive brain is actually the youngest part of the brain
and occupies only about 30 percent of the area inside our skull. The rational
brain is primarily concerned with the world outside us: understanding how
things and people work and figuring out how to accomplish our goals,
manage our time, and sequence our actions. Beneath the rational brain lie
two evolutionarily older , and to some degree separate, brains, which are in
char ge of everything else: the moment-by-moment registration and
management of our body’ s physiology and the identification of comfort,

safety , threat, hunger , fatigue, desire, longing, excitement, pleasure, and
pain.
The brain is built from the bottom up. It develops level by level within
every child in the womb, just as it did in the course of evolution. The most
primitive part, the part that is already online when we are born, is the
ancient animal brain, often called the reptilian brain. It is located in the
brain stem, just above the place where our spinal cord enters the skull. The
reptilian brain is responsible for all the things that newborn babies can do:
eat, sleep, wake, cry , breathe; feel temperature, hunger , wetness, and pain;
and rid the body of toxins by urinating and defecating. The brain stem and
the hypothalamus (which sits directly above it) together control the ener gy
levels of the body . They coordinate the functioning of the heart and lungs
and also the endocrine and immune systems, ensuring that these basic life-
sustaining systems are maintained within the relatively stable internal
balance known as homeostasis.
Breathing, eating, sleeping, pooping, and peeing are so fundamental
that their significance is easily neglected when we’re considering the
complexities of mind and behavior . However , if your sleep is disturbed or
your bowels don’ t work, or if you always feel hungry , or if being touched
makes you want to scream (as is often the case with traumatized children
and adults), the entire or ganism is thrown into disequilibrium. It is amazing
how many psychological problems involve dif ficulties with sleep, appetite,
touch, digestion, and arousal. Any ef fective treatment for trauma has to
address these basic housekeeping functions of the body .
Right above the reptilian brain is the limbic system. It’ s also known as
the mammalian brain, because all animals that live in groups and nurture
their young possess one. Development of this part of the brain truly takes
of f after a baby is born. It is the seat of the emotions, the monitor of danger ,
the judge of what is pleasurable or scary , the arbiter of what is or is not
important for survival purposes. It is also a central command post for
coping with the challenges of living within our complex social networks.
The limbic system is shaped in response to experience, in partnership
with the infant’ s own genetic makeup and inborn temperament. (As all
parents of more than one child quickly notice, babies dif fer from birth in the
intensity and nature of their reactions to similar events.) Whatever happens
to a baby contributes to the emotional and perceptual map of the world that

its developing brain creates. As my colleague Bruce Perry explains it, the
brain is formed in a “use-dependent manner .”5 This is another way of
describing neuroplasticity , the relatively recent discovery that neurons that
“fire together , wire together .” When a circuit fires repeatedly , it can become
a default setting—the response most likely to occur . If you feel safe and
loved, your brain becomes specialized in exploration, play , and cooperation;
if you are frightened and unwanted, it specializes in managing feelings of
fear and abandonment.
As infants and toddlers we learn about the world by moving, grabbing,
and crawling and by discovering what happens when we cry , smile, or
protest. W e are constantly experimenting with our surroundings—how do
our interactions change the way our bodies feel? Attend any two-year -old’ s
birthday party and notice how little Kimberly will engage you, play with
you, flirt with you, without any need for language. These early explorations
shape the limbic structures devoted to emotions and memory , but these
structures can also be significantly modified by later experiences: for the
better by a close friendship or a beautiful first love, for example, or for the
worse by a violent assault, relentless bullying, or neglect.
T aken together the reptilian brain and limbic system make up what I’ll
call the “emotional brain” throughout this book.6 The emotional brain is at
the heart of the central nervous system, and its key task is to look out for
your welfare. If it detects danger or a special opportunity—such as a
promising partner—it alerts you by releasing a squirt of hormones. The
resulting visceral sensations (ranging from mild queasiness to the grip of
panic in your chest) will interfere with whatever your mind is currently
focused on and get you moving—physically and mentally—in a dif ferent
direction. Even at their most subtle, these sensations have a huge influence
on the small and lar ge decisions we make throughout our lives: what we
choose to eat, where we like to sleep and with whom, what music we prefer ,
whether we like to garden or sing in a choir , and whom we befriend and
whom we detest.
The emotional brain’ s cellular or ganization and biochemistry are
simpler than those of the neocortex, our rational brain, and it assesses
incoming information in a more global way . As a result, it jumps to
conclusions based on rough similarities, in contrast with the rational brain,

which is or ganized to sort through a complex set of options. (The textbook
example is leaping back in terror when you see a snake—only to realize that
it’ s just a coiled rope.) The emotional brain initiates preprogrammed escape
plans, like the fight-or -flight responses. These muscular and physiological
reactions are automatic, set in motion without any thought or planning on
our part, leaving our conscious, rational capacities to catch up later , often
well after the threat is over .
Finally we reach the top layer of the brain, the neocortex. W e share this
outer layer with other mammals, but it is much thicker in us humans. In the
second year of life the frontal lobes, which make up the bulk of our
neocortex, begin to develop at a rapid pace. The ancient philosophers called
seven years “the age of reason.” For us first grade is the prelude of things to
come, a life or ganized around frontal-lobe capacities: sitting still; keeping
sphincters in check; being able to use words rather than acting out;
understanding abstract and symbolic ideas; planning for tomorrow; and
being in tune with teachers and classmates.
The frontal lobes are responsible for the qualities that make us unique
within the animal kingdom.7 They enable us to use language and abstract
thought. They give us our ability to absorb and integrate vast amounts of
information and attach meaning to it. Despite our excitement about the
linguistic feats of chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys, only human beings
command the words and symbols necessary to create the communal,
spiritual, and historical contexts that shape our lives.
The frontal lobes allow us to plan and reflect, to imagine and play out
future scenarios. They help us to predict what will happen if we take one
action (like applying for a new job) or neglect another (not paying the rent).
They make choice possible and underlie our astonishing creativity .
Generations of frontal lobes, working in close collaboration, have created
culture, which got us from dug-out canoes, horse-drawn carriages, and
letters to jet planes, hybrid cars, and e-mail. They also gave us Noam’ s
lifesaving trampoline.
MIRRORING EACH OTHER: INTERPERSONAL
NEUROBIOLOGY

Crucial for understanding trauma, the frontal lobes are also the seat of
empathy—our ability to “feel into” someone else. One of the truly
sensational discoveries of modern neuroscience took place in 1994, when in
a lucky accident a group of Italian scientists identified specialized cells in
the cortex that came to be known as mirror neurons.8 The researchers had
attached electrodes to individual neurons in a monkey’ s premotor area, then
set up a computer to monitor precisely which neurons fired when the
monkey picked up a peanut or grasped a banana. At one point an
experimenter was putting food pellets into a box when he looked up at the
computer . The monkey’ s brain cells were firing at the exact location where
the motor command neurons were located. But the monkey wasn’ t eating or
moving. He was watching the researcher , and his brain was vicariously
mirroring the researcher ’ s actions.
Numerous other experiments followed around the world, and it soon
became clear that mirror neurons explained many previously unexplainable
aspects of the mind, such as empathy , imitation, synchrony , and even the
development of language. One writer compared mirror neurons to “neural
W iFi”9—we pick up not only another person’ s movement but her emotional
state and intentions as well. When people are in sync with each other , they
tend to stand or sit similar ways, and their voices take on the same rhythms.
But our mirror neurons also make us vulnerable to others’ negativity , so that
we respond to their anger with fury or are dragged down by their
depression. I’ll have more to say about mirror neurons later in this book,
because trauma almost invariably involves not being seen, not being
mirrored, and not being taken into account. T reatment needs to reactivate
the capacity to safely mirror , and be mirrored, by others, but also to resist
being hijacked by others’ negative emotions.

The T riune (Thr ee-part) Brain.  The brain develops from the bottom up. The reptilian brain
develops in the womb and or ganizes basic life sustaining functions. It is highly responsive to
threat throughout our entire life span. The limbic system is or ganized mainly during the first six
years of life but continues to evolve in a use-dependent manner . T rauma can have a major
impact of its functioning throughout life. The prefrontal cortex develops last, and also is
af fected by trauma exposure, including being unable to filter out irrelevant information.
Throughout life it is vulnerable to go of f-line in response to threat.
As anybody who has worked with brain-damaged people or taken care
of demented parents has learned the hard way , well-functioning frontal
lobes are crucial for harmonious relationships with our fellow humans.
Realizing that other people can think and feel dif ferently from us is a huge
developmental step for two- and three-year -olds. They learn to understand
others’ motives, so they can adapt and stay safe in groups that have
dif ferent perceptions, expectations, and values. W ithout flexible, active
frontal lobes people become creatures of habit, and their relationships
become superficial and routine. Invention and innovation, discovery and
wonder—all are lacking.
Our frontal lobes can also (sometimes, but not always) stop us from
doing things that will embarrass us or hurt others.  W e don’ t have to eat
every time we’re hungry , kiss anybody who rouses our desires, or blow up
every time we’re angry . But it is exactly on that edge between impulse and
acceptable behavior where most of our troubles begin. The more intense the

visceral, sensory input from the emotional brain, the less capacity the
rational brain has to put a damper on it.
IDENTIFYING DANGER: THE COOK AND THE SMOKE
DETECT OR
Danger is a normal part of life, and the brain is in char ge of detecting it and
or ganizing our response. Sensory information about the outside world
arrives through our eyes, nose, ears, and skin. These sensations conver ge in
the thalamus, an area inside the limbic system that acts as the “cook” within
the brain. The thalamus stirs all the input from our perceptions into a fully
blended autobiographical soup, an integrated, coherent experience of “this
is what is happening to me.”10 The sensations are then passed on in two
directions—down to the amygdala, two small almond-shaped structures that
lie deeper in the limbic, unconscious brain, and up to the frontal lobes,
where they reach our conscious awareness. The neuroscientist Joseph
LeDoux calls the pathway to the amygdala “the low road,” which is
extremely fast, and that to the frontal cortex the “high road,” which takes
several milliseconds longer in the midst of an overwhelmingly threatening
experience. However , processing by the thalamus can break down. Sights,
sounds, smells, and touch are encoded as isolated, dissociated fragments,
and normal memory processing disintegrates. T ime freezes, so that the
present danger feels like it will last forever .
The central function of the amygdala, which I call the brain’ s smoke
detector , is to identify whether incoming input is relevant for our survival.1 1
It does so quickly and automatically , with the help of feedback from the
hippocampus, a nearby structure that relates the new input to past
experiences. If the amygdala senses a threat—a potential collision with an
oncoming vehicle, a person on the street who looks threatening—it sends an
instant message down to the hypothalamus and the brain stem, recruiting
the stress-hormone system and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to
orchestrate a whole-body response. Because the amygdala processes the
information it receives from the thalamus faster than the frontal lobes do, it
decides whether incoming information is a threat to our survival even

before we are consciously aware of the danger . By the time we realize what
is happening, our body may already be on the move.
The emotional brain has first dibs on interpr eting incoming information.  Sensory
Information about the environment and body state received by the eyes, ears, touch, kinesthetic
sense, etc., conver ges on the thalamus, where it is processed, and then passed on to the
amygdala to interpret its emotional significance. This occurs with lightning speed. If a threat is
detected the amygdala sends messages to the hypothalamus to secrete stress hormones to
defend against that threat. The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux calls this the low road. The
second neural pathway , the high road, runs from the thalamus, via the hippocampus and
anterior cingulate, to the prefrontal cortex, the rational brain, for a conscious and much more
refined interpretation. This takes several microseconds longer . If the interpretation of threat by
the amygdala is too intense, and/or the filtering system from the higher areas of the brain are
too weak, as often happens in PTSD, people lose control over automatic emer gency responses,
like prolonged startle or aggressive outbursts.
The amygdala’ s danger signals trigger the release of powerful stress
hormones, including cortisol and adrenaline, which increase heart rate,
blood pressure, and rate of breathing, preparing us to fight back or run
away . Once the danger is past, the body returns to its normal state fairly
quickly . But when recovery is blocked, the body is triggered to defend
itself, which makes people feel agitated and aroused.
While the smoke detector is usually pretty good at picking up danger
clues, trauma increases the risk of misinterpreting whether a particular

situation is dangerous or safe. Y ou can get along with other people only if
you can accurately gauge whether their intentions are benign or dangerous.
Even a slight misreading can lead to painful misunderstandings in
relationships at home and at work. Functioning ef fectively in a complex
work environment or a household filled with rambunctious kids requires the
ability to quickly assess how people are feeling and continuously adjusting
your behavior accordingly . Faulty alarm systems lead to blowups or
shutdowns in response to innocuous comments or facial expressions.
CONTROLLING THE STRESS RESPONSE: THE
W A TCHT OWER
If the amygdala is the smoke detector in the brain, think of the frontal lobes
—and specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC),12 located directly
above our eyes—as the watchtower , of fering a view of the scene from on
high. Is that smoke you smell the sign that your house is on fire and you
need to get out, fast—or is it coming from the steak you put over too high a
flame? The amygdala doesn’ t make such judgments; it just gets you ready
to fight back or escape, even before the frontal lobes get a chance to weigh
in with their assessment. As long as you are not too upset, your frontal
lobes can restore your balance by helping you realize that you are
responding to a false alarm and abort the stress response.
Ordinarily the executive capacities of the prefrontal cortex enable
people to observe what is going on, predict what will happen if they take a
certain action, and make a conscious choice. Being able to hover calmly
and objectively over our thoughts, feelings, and emotions (an ability I’ll call
mindfulness throughout this book) and then take our time to respond allows
the executive brain to inhibit, or ganize, and modulate the hardwired
automatic reactions preprogrammed into the emotional brain. This capacity
is crucial for preserving our relationships with our fellow human beings. As
long as our frontal lobes are working properly , we’re unlikely to lose our
temper every time a waiter is late with our order or an insurance company
agent puts us on hold. (Our watchtower also tells us that other people’ s
anger and threats are a function of their  emotional state.) When that system

breaks down, we become like conditioned animals: The moment we detect
danger we automatically go into fight-or -flight mode.
T op down or bottom up.  Structures in the emotional brain decide what we perceive as
dangerous or safe. There are two ways of changing the threat detection system: from the top
down, via modulating messages from the medial prefrontal cortex (not just prefrontal cortex),
or from the bottom up, via the reptilian brain, through breathing, movement, and touch.
In PTSD the critical balance between the amygdala (smoke detector)
and the MPFC (watchtower) shifts radically , which makes it much harder to
control emotions and impulses. Neuroimaging studies of human beings in
highly emotional states reveal that intense fear , sadness, and anger all
increase the activation of subcortical brain regions involved in emotions
and significantly reduce the activity in various areas in the frontal lobe,
particularly the MPFC. When that occurs, the inhibitory capacities of the
frontal lobe break down, and people “take leave of their senses”: They may
startle in response to any loud sound, become enraged by small frustrations,
or freeze when somebody touches them.13

Ef fectively dealing with stress depends upon achieving a balance
between the smoke detector and the watchtower . If you want to manage
your emotions better , your brain gives you two options: Y ou can learn to
regulate them from the top down or from the bottom up.
Knowing the dif ference between top down and bottom up regulation is
central for understanding and treating traumatic stress. T op-down regulation
involves strengthening the capacity of the watchtower to monitor your
body’ s sensations. Mindfulness meditation and yoga can help with this.
Bottom-up regulation involves recalibrating the autonomic nervous system,
(which, as we have seen, originates in the brain stem). W e can access the
ANS through breath, movement, or touch. Breathing is one of the few body
functions under both conscious and autonomic control. In part 5 of this
book we’ll explore specific techniques for increasing both top-down and
bottom-up regulation.
THE RIDER AND THE HORSE
For now I want to emphasize that emotion is not opposed to reason; our
emotions assign value to experiences and thus are the foundation of reason.
Our self-experience is the product of the balance between our rational and
our emotional brains. When these two systems are in balance, we “feel like
ourselves.” However , when our survival is at stake, these systems can
function relatively independently .
If, say , you are driving along, chatting with a friend, and a truck
suddenly looms in the corner of your eye, you instantly stop talking, slam
on the brakes, and turn your steering wheel to get out of harm’ s way . If your
instinctive actions have saved you from a collision, you may resume where
you left of f. Whether you are able to do so depends lar gely on how quickly
your visceral reactions subside to the threat.
The neuroscientist Paul MacLean, who developed the three-part
description of the brain that I’ve used here, compared the relationship
between the rational brain and the emotional brain to that between a more
or less competent rider and his unruly horse.14 As long as the weather is
calm and the path is smooth, the rider can feel in excellent control. But
unexpected sounds or threats from other animals can make the horse bolt,

forcing the rider to hold on for dear life. Likewise, when people feel that
their survival is at stake or they are seized by rages, longings, fear , or sexual
desires, they stop listening to the voice of reason, and it makes little sense
to ar gue with them. Whenever the limbic system decides that something is a
question of life or death, the pathways between the frontal lobes and the
limbic system become extremely tenuous.
Psychologists usually try to help people use insight and understanding
to manage their behavior . However , neuroscience research shows that very
few psychological problems are the result of defects in understanding; most
originate in pressures from deeper regions in the brain that drive our
perception and attention. When the alarm bell of the emotional brain keeps
signaling that you are in danger , no amount of insight will silence it. I am
reminded of the comedy in which a seven-time recidivist in an anger -
management program extols the virtue of the techniques he’ s learned:
“They are great and work terrific—as long as you are not really angry .”
When our emotional and rational brains are in conflict (as when we’re
enraged with someone we love, frightened by someone we depend on, or
lust after someone who is of f limits), a tug-of-war ensues. This war is
lar gely played out in the theater of visceral experience—your gut, your
heart, your lungs—and will lead to both physical discomfort and
psychological misery . Chapter 6 will discuss how the brain and viscera
interact in safety and danger , which is key to understanding the many
physical manifestations of trauma.
I’d like to end this chapter by examining two more brain scans that
illustrate some of the core features of traumatic stress: timeless reliving;
reexperiencing images, sounds, and emotions; and dissociation.
ST AN AND UTE’S BRAINS ON TRAUMA
On a fine September morning in 1999, Stan and Ute Lawrence, a
professional couple in their forties, set out from their home in London,
Ontario, to attend a business meeting in Detroit. Halfway through the
journey they ran into a wall of dense fog that reduced visibility to zero in a
split second. Stan immediately slammed on the brakes, coming to a
standstill sideways on the highway , just missing a huge truck. An eighteen-

wheeler went flying over the trunk of their car; vans and cars slammed into
them and into each other . People who got out of their cars were hit as they
ran for their lives. The ear -splitting crashes went on and on—with each jolt
from behind they felt this would be the one that killed them. Stan and Ute
were trapped in car number thirteen of an eighty-seven-car pileup, the worst
road disaster in Canadian history .15
Then came the eerie silence. Stan struggled to open the doors and
windows, but the eighteen-wheeler that had crushed their trunk was wedged
against the car . Suddenly , someone was pounding on their roof. A girl was
screaming, “Get me out of here—I’m on fire!” Helplessly , they saw her die
as the car she’d been in was consumed by flames. The next thing they
knew , a truck driver was standing on the hood of their car with a fire
extinguisher . He smashed the windshield to free them, and Stan climbed
through the opening. T urning around to help his wife, he saw Ute sitting
frozen in her seat. Stan and the truck driver lifted her out and an ambulance
took them to an emer gency room. Aside from a few cuts, they were found
to be physically unscathed.
At home that night, neither Stan nor Ute wanted to go to sleep. They
felt that if they let go, they would die. They were irritable, jumpy , and on
edge. That night, and for many to come, they drank copious quantities of
wine to numb their fear . They could not stop the images that were haunting
them or the questions that went on and on: What if they’d left earlier? What
if they hadn’ t stopped for gas? After three months of this, they sought help
from Dr . Ruth Lanius, a psychiatrist at the University of W estern Ontario.
Dr . Lanius, who had been my student at the T rauma Center a few years
earlier , told Stan and Ute she wanted to visualize their brains with an fMRI
scan before beginning treatment. The fMRI measures neural activity by
tracking changes in blood flow in the brain, and unlike the PET scan, it
does not require exposure to radiation. Dr . Lanius used the same kind of
script-driven imagery we had used at Harvard, capturing the images,
sounds, smells, and other sensations Stan and Ute had experienced while
they were trapped in the car .
Stan went first and immediately went into a flashback, just as Marsha
had in our Harvard study . He came out of the scanner sweating, with his
heart racing and his blood pressure sky high. “This was just the way I felt

during the accident,” he reported. “I was sure I was going to die, and there
was nothing I could do to save myself.” Instead of remembering the
accident as something that had happened three months earlier , Stan was
reliving it.
DISSOCIA TION AND RELIVING
Dissociation is the essence of trauma. The overwhelming experience is split
of f and fragmented, so that the emotions, sounds, images, thoughts, and
physical sensations related to the trauma take on a life of their own. The
sensory fragments of memory intrude into the present, where they are
literally relived. As long as the trauma is not resolved, the stress hormones
that the body secretes to protect itself keep circulating, and the defensive
movements and emotional responses keep getting replayed. Unlike Stan,
however , many people may not be aware of the connection between their
“crazy” feelings and reactions and the traumatic events that are being
replayed. They have no idea why they respond to some minor irritation as if
they were about to be annihilated.
Flashbacks and reliving are in some ways worse that the trauma itself.
A traumatic event has a beginning and an end—at some point it is over . But
for people with PTSD a flashback can occur at any time, whether they are
awake or asleep. There is no way of knowing when it’ s going to occur again
or how long it will last. People who suf fer from flashbacks often or ganize
their lives around trying to protect against them. They may compulsively go
to the gym to pump iron (but finding that they are never strong enough),
numb themselves with drugs, or try to cultivate an illusory sense of control
in highly dangerous situations (like motorcycle racing, bungee jumping, or
working as an ambulance driver). Constantly fighting unseen dangers is
exhausting and leaves them fatigued, depressed, and weary .
If elements of the trauma are replayed again and again, the
accompanying stress hormones engrave those memories ever more deeply
in the mind. Ordinary , day-to-day events become less and less compelling.
Not being able to deeply take in what is going on around them makes it
impossible to feel fully alive. It becomes harder to feel the joys and
aggravations of ordinary life, harder to concentrate on the tasks at hand. Not

being fully alive in the present keeps them more firmly imprisoned in the
past.
T riggered responses manifest in various ways. V eterans may react to
the slightest cue—like hitting a bump in the road or a seeing a kid playing
in the street—as if they were in a war zone. They startle easily and become
enraged or numb. V ictims of childhood sexual abuse may anesthetize their
sexuality and then feel intensely ashamed if they become excited by
sensations or images that recall their molestation, even when those
sensations are the natural pleasures associated with particular body parts. If
trauma survivors are forced to discuss their experiences, one person’ s blood
pressure may increase while another responds with the beginnings of a
migraine headache. Still others may shut down emotionally and not feel any
obvious changes. However , in the lab we have no problem detecting their
racing hearts and the stress hormones churning through their bodies.
These reactions are irrational and lar gely outside people’ s control.
Intense and barely controllable ur ges and emotions make people feel crazy
—and makes them feel they don’ t belong to the human race. Feeling numb
during birthday parties for your kids or in response to the death of loved
ones makes people feel like monsters. As a result, shame becomes the
dominant emotion and hiding the truth the central preoccupation.
They are rarely in touch with the origins of their alienation. That is
where therapy comes in—is the beginning of bringing the emotions that
were generated by trauma being able to feel, the capacity to observe oneself
online. However , the bottom line is that the threat-perception system of the
brain has changed, and people’ s physical reactions are dictated by the
imprint of the past.
The trauma that started “out there” is now played out on the battlefield
of their own bodies, usually without a conscious connection between what
happened back then and what is going on right now inside. The challenge is
not so much learning to accept the terrible things that have happened but
learning how to gain mastery over one’ s internal sensations and emotions.
Sensing, naming, and identifying what is going on inside is the first step to
recovery .
THE SMOKE DETECT OR GOES ON OVERDRIVE

Stan’ s brain scan shows his flashback in action. This is what reliving trauma
looks like in the brain: the brightly lit area in the lower right-hand corner ,
the blanked-out lower left side, and the four symmetrical white holes
around the center . (Y ou may recognize the lit-up amygdala and the of f-line
left brain from the Harvard study discussed in chapter 3.) Stan’ s amygdala
made no distinction between past and present. It activated just as if the car
crash were happening in the scanner , triggering powerful stress hormones
and nervous-system responses. These were responsible for his sweating and
trembling, his racing heart and elevated blood pressure: entirely normal and
potentially lifesaving responses if a truck has just smashed into your car .
Imaging a flashback with fMRI.  Notice how much more activity appears on the right side
than on the left.
It’ s important to have an ef ficient smoke detector: Y ou don’ t want to
get caught unawares by a raging fire. But if you go into a frenzy every time

you smell smoke, it becomes intensely disruptive. Y es, you need to detect
whether somebody is getting upset with you, but if your amygdala goes into
overdrive, you may become chronically scared that people hate you, or you
may feel like they are out to get you.
THE TIMEKEEPER COLLAPSES
Both Stan and Ute had become hypersensitive and irritable after the
accident, suggesting that their prefrontal cortex was struggling to maintain
control in the face of stress. Stan’ s flashback precipitated a more extreme
reaction.
The two white areas in the front of the brain (on top in the picture) are
the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. When those areas are
deactivated, people lose their sense of time and become trapped in the
moment, without a sense of past, present, or future.16
T wo brain systems are relevant for the mental processing of trauma:
those dealing with emotional intensity and context. Emotional intensity is
defined by the smoke alarm, the amygdala, and its counterweight, the
watchtower , the medial prefrontal cortex. The context and meaning of an
experience are determined by the system that includes the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the hippocampus. The DLPFC is located to
the side in the front brain, while the MPFC is in the center . The structures
along the midline of the brain are devoted to your inner experience of
yourself, those on the side are more concerned with your relationship with
your surroundings.
The DLPFC tells us how our present experience relates to the past and
how it may af fect the future—you can think of it as the timekeeper of the
brain. Knowing that whatever is happening is finite and will sooner or later
come to an end makes most experiences tolerable. The opposite is also true
—situations become intolerable if they feel interminable. Most of us know
from sad personal experience that terrible grief is typically accompanied by
the sense that this wretched state will last forever , and that we will never get
over our loss. T rauma is the ultimate experience of “this will last forever .”
Stan’ s scan reveals why people can recover from trauma only when the
brain structures that were knocked out during the original experience—

which is why the event registered in the brain as trauma in the first place—
are fully online. V isiting the past in therapy should be done while people
are, biologically speaking, firmly rooted in the present and feeling as calm,
safe, and grounded as possible. (“Grounded” means that you can feel your
butt in your chair , see the light coming through the window , feel the tension
in your calves, and hear the wind stirring the tree outside.) Being anchored
in the present while revisiting the trauma opens the possibility of deeply
knowing that the terrible events belong to the past. For that to happen, the
brain’ s watchtower , cook, and timekeeper need to be online. Therapy won’ t
work as long as people keep being pulled back into the past.
THE THALAMUS SHUTS DOWN
Look again at the scan of Stan’ s flashback, and you can see two more white
holes in the lower half of the brain. These are his right and left thalamus—
blanked out during the flashback as they were during the original trauma.
As I’ve said, the thalamus functions as a “cook”—a relay station that
collects sensations from the ears, eyes, and skin and integrates them into the
soup that is our autobiographical memory . Breakdown of the thalamus
explains why trauma is primarily remembered not as a story , a narrative
with a beginning middle and end, but as isolated sensory imprints: images,
sounds, and physical sensations that are accompanied by intense emotions,
usually terror and helplessness.17
In normal circumstances the thalamus also acts as a filter or gatekeeper .
This makes it a central component of attention, concentration, and new
learning—all of which are compromised by trauma. As you sit here reading,
you may hear music in the background or traf fic rumbling by or feel a faint
gnawing in your stomach telling you it’ s time for a snack. If you are able to
stay focused on this page, your thalamus is helping you distinguish between
sensory information that is relevant and information that you can safely
ignore. In chapter 19, on neurofeedback, I’ll discuss some of the tests we
use to measure how well this gating system works, as well as ways to
strengthen it.
People with PTSD have their floodgates wide open. Lacking a filter ,
they are on constant sensory overload. In order to cope, they try to shut

themselves down and develop tunnel vision and hyperfocus. If they can’ t
shut down naturally , they may enlist drugs or alcohol to block out the
world. The tragedy is that the price of closing down includes filtering out
sources of pleasure and joy , as well.
DEPERSONALIZA TION: SPLIT OFF FROM THE SELF
Let’ s now look at Ute’ s experience in the scanner . Not all people react to
trauma in exactly the same way , but in this case the dif ference is
particularly dramatic, since Ute was sitting right next to Stan in the wrecked
car . She responded to her trauma script by going numb: Her mind went
blank, and nearly every area of her brain showed markedly decreased
activity . Her heart rate and blood pressure didn’ t elevate. When asked how
she’d felt during the scan, she replied: “I felt just like I felt at the time of the
accident: I felt nothing.”

Blanking out (dissociation) in r esponse to being r eminded of past trauma.  In this case
almost every area of the brain has decreased activation, interfering with thinking, focus, and
orientation.
The medical term for Ute’ s response is depersonalization .18 Anyone
who deals with traumatized men, women, or children is sooner or later
confronted with blank stares and absent minds, the outward manifestation
of the biological freeze reaction. Depersonalization is one symptom of the
massive dissociation created by trauma. Stan’ s flashbacks came from his
thwarted ef forts to escape the crash—cued by the script, all his dissociated,
fragmented sensations and emotions roared back into the present. But
instead of struggling to escape, Ute had dissociated her fear and felt
nothing.

I see depersonalization regularly in my of fice when patients tell me
horrendous stories without any feeling. All the ener gy drains out of the
room, and I have to make a valiant ef fort to keep paying attention. A lifeless
patient forces you to work much harder to keep the therapy alive, and I
often used to pray for the hour to be over quickly .
After seeing Ute’ s scan, I started to take a very dif ferent approach
toward blanked-out patients. W ith nearly every part of their brains tuned
out, they obviously cannot think, feel deeply , remember , or make sense out
of what is going on. Conventional talk therapy , in those circumstances, is
virtually useless.
In Ute’ s case it was possible to guess why she responded so dif ferently
from Stan. She was utilizing a survival strategy her brain had learned in
childhood to cope with her mother ’ s harsh treatment. Ute’ s father died when
she was nine years old, and her mother subsequently was often nasty and
demeaning to her . At some point Ute discovered that she could blank out
her mind when her mother yelled at her . Thirty-five years later , when she
was trapped in her demolished car , Ute’ s brain automatically went into the
same survival mode—she made herself disappear .
The challenge for people like Ute is to become alert and engaged, a
dif ficult but unavoidable task if they want to recapture their lives. (Ute
herself did recover—she wrote a book about her experiences and started a
successful journal called Mental Fitness .) This is where a bottom-up
approach to therapy becomes essential. The aim is actually to change the
patient’ s physiology , his or her relationship to bodily sensations. At the
T rauma Center we work with such basic measures as heart rate and
breathing patterns. W e help patients evoke and notice bodily sensations by
tapping acupressure19 points. Rhythmic interactions with other people are
also ef fective—tossing a beach ball back and forth, bouncing on a Pilates
ball, drumming, or dancing to music.
Numbing is the other side of the coin in PTSD. Many untreated trauma
survivors start out like Stan, with explosive flashbacks, then numb out later
in life. While reliving trauma is dramatic, frightening, and potentially self-
destructive, over time a lack of presence can be even more damaging. This
is a particular problem with traumatized children. The acting-out kids tend

to get attention; the blanked-out ones don’ t bother anybody and are left to
lose their future bit by bit.
LEARNING T O LIVE IN THE PRESENT
The challenge of trauma treatment is not only dealing with the past but,
even more, enhancing the quality of day-to-day experience. One reason that
traumatic memories become dominant in PTSD is that it’ s so dif ficult to
feel truly alive right now . When you can’ t be fully here, you go to the
places where you did feel alive—even if those places are filled with horror
and misery .
Many treatment approaches for traumatic stress focus on desensitizing
patients to their past, with the expectation that reexposure to their traumas
will reduce emotional outbursts and flashbacks. I believe that this is based
on a misunderstanding of what happens in traumatic stress. W e must most
of all help our patients to live fully and securely in the present. In order to
do that, we need to help bring those brain structures that deserted them
when they were overwhelmed by trauma back. Desensitization may make
you less reactive, but if you cannot feel satisfaction in ordinary everyday
things like taking a walk, cooking a meal, or playing with your kids, life
will pass you by .

Life is about rhythm. W e vibrate, our hearts are pumping blood.
W e are a rhythm machine, that’ s what we are.
—Mickey Hart
oward the end of his career , in 1872, Charles Darwin published The
Expr ession of the Emotions in Man and Animals.1 Until recently most
scientific discussion of Darwin’ s theories has focused on On  the Origin of
Species  (1859) and The Descent of Man  (1871) . But The  Expr ession of the
Emotions  turns out to be an extraordinary exploration of the foundations of
emotional life, filled with observations and anecdotes drawn from decades
of inquiry , as well as close-to-home stories of Darwin’ s children and
household pets. It’ s also a landmark in book illustration—one of the first
books ever to include photographs. (Photography was still a relatively new
technology and, like most scientists, Darwin wanted to make use of the
latest techniques to make his points.) It’ s still in print today , readily
available in a recent edition with a terrific introduction and commentaries
by Paul Ekman, a modern pioneer in the study of emotions.
Darwin starts his discussion by noting the physical or ganization
common to all mammals, including human beings—the lungs, kidneys,
brains, digestive or gans, and sexual or gans that sustain and continue life.
Although many scientists today would accuse him of anthropomorphism,
Darwin stands with animal lovers when he proclaims: “Man and the higher

animals . . . [also] have instincts in common. All have the same senses,
intuition, sensation, passions, af fections, and emotions, even the more
complex ones such as jealousy , suspicion, emulation, gratitude, and
magnanimity .”2 He observes that we humans share some of the physical
signs of animal emotion. Feeling the hair on the back of your neck stand up
when you’re frightened or baring your teeth when you’re enraged can only
be understood as vestiges of a long evolutionary process.


“When a man sneers or snarls at another , is the corner of the canine or eye tooth raised on the
side facing the man whom he addresses?” —Charles Darwin, 1872
For Darwin mammalian emotions are fundamentally rooted in biology:
They are the indispensable source of motivation to initiate action. Emotions
(from the Latin emover e —to move out) give shape and direction to
whatever we do, and their primary expression is through the muscles of the
face and body . These facial and physical movements communicate our
mental state and intention to others: Angry expressions and threatening
postures caution them to back of f. Sadness attracts care and attention. Fear
signals helplessness or alerts us to danger .
W e instinctively read the dynamic between two people simply from
their tension or relaxation, their postures and tone of voice, their changing
facial expressions. W atch a movie in a language you don’ t know , and you
can still guess the quality of the relationship between the characters. W e
often can read other mammals (monkeys, dogs, horses) in the same way .
Darwin goes on to observe that the fundamental purpose of emotions is
to initiate movement that will restore the or ganism to safety and physical
equilibrium. Here is his comment on the origin of what today we would call
PTSD:

Behaviors to avoid or escape from danger have clearly evolved to
render each or ganism competitive in terms of survival. But
inappropriately prolonged escape or avoidance behavior would put
the animal at a disadvantage in that successful species preservation
demands reproduction which, in turn, depends upon feeding,
shelter and mating activities all of which are reciprocals of
avoidance and escape.3
In other words: If an or ganism is stuck in survival mode, its ener gies
are focused on fighting of f unseen enemies, which leaves no room for
nurture, care, and love. For us humans, it means that as long as the mind is
defending itself against invisible assaults, our closest bonds are threatened,
along with our ability to imagine, plan, play , learn, and pay attention to
other people’ s needs.
Darwin also wrote about body-brain connections that we are still
exploring today . Intense emotions involve not only the mind but also the gut
and the heart: “Heart, guts, and brain communicate intimately via the
‘pneumogastric’ nerve, the critical nerve involved in the expression and
management of emotions in both humans and animals. When the mind is
strongly excited, it instantly af fects the state of the viscera; so that under
excitement there will be much mutual action and reaction between these,
the two most important or gans of the body .”4
The first time I encountered this passage, I reread it with growing
excitement. Of course we experience our most devastating emotions as gut-
wrenching feelings and heartbreak. As long as we register emotions
primarily in our heads, we can remain pretty much in control, but feeling as
if our chest is caving in or we’ve been punched in the gut is unbearable.
W e’ll do anything to make these awful visceral sensations go away , whether
it is clinging desperately to another human being, rendering ourselves
insensible with drugs or alcohol, or taking a knife to the skin to replace
overwhelming emotions with definable sensations. How many mental
health problems, from drug addiction to self-injurious behavior , start as
attempts to cope with the unbearable physical pain of our emotions? If
Darwin was right, the solution requires finding ways to help people alter the
inner sensory landscape of their bodies.

Until recently , this bidirectional communication between body and
mind was lar gely ignored by W estern science, even as it had long been
central to traditional healing practices in many other parts of the world,
notably in India and China. T oday it is transforming our understanding of
trauma and recovery .
A WINDOW INT O THE NER V OUS SYSTEM
All of the little signs we instinctively register during a conversation—the
muscle shifts and tensions in the other person’ s face, eye movements and
pupil dilation, pitch and speed of the voice—as well as the fluctuations in
our own inner landscape—salivation, swallowing, breathing, and heart rate
—are linked by a single regulatory system.5 All are a product of the
synchrony between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system
(ANS): the sympathetic, which acts as the body’ s accelerator , and the
parasympathetic, which serves as its brake.6 These are the “reciprocals”
Darwin spoke of, and working together they play an important role in
managing the body’ s ener gy flow , one preparing for its expenditure, the
other for its conservation.
The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for arousal,
including the fight-or -flight response (Darwin’ s “escape or avoidance
behavior”). Almost two thousand years ago the Roman physician Galen
gave it the name “sympathetic” because he observed that it functioned with
the emotions ( sym  pathos ). The SNS moves blood to the muscles for quick
action, partly by triggering the adrenal glands to squirt out adrenaline,
which speeds up the heart rate and increases blood pressure.
The second branch of the ANS is the parasympathetic (“against
emotions”) nervous system (PNS), which  promotes self-preservative
functions like digestion and wound healing. It triggers the release of
acetylcholine to put a brake on arousal, slowing the heart down, relaxing
muscles, and returning breathing to normal. As Darwin pointed out,
“feeding, shelter , and mating activities” depend on the PNS.
There is a simple way to experience these two systems for yourself.
Whenever you take a deep  breath, you activate the SNS. The resulting burst
of adrenaline speeds up your heart, which explains why many athletes take

a few short, deep breaths before starting competition. Exhaling, in turn,
activates the PNS, which slows down the heart. If you take a yoga or a
meditation class, your instructor will probably ur ge you to pay particular
attention to the exhalation, since deep, long breaths out help calm you
down.  As we breathe, we continually speed up and slow down the heart,
and because of that the interval between two successive heartbeats is never
precisely the same. A measurement called heart rate variability (HR V) can
be used to test the flexibility of this system, and good HR V—the more
fluctuation, the better—is a sign that the brake and accelerator in your
arousal system are both functioning properly and in balance.  W e had a
breakthrough when we acquired an instrument to measure HR V , and I will
explain in chapter 16 how we can use HR V to help treat PTSD.
THE NEURAL LOVE CODE7
In 1994 Stephen Por ges, who was a researcher at the University of
Maryland at the time we started our investigation of HR V , and who is now
at the University of North Carolina, introduced the Polyvagal Theory ,
which built on Darwin’ s observations and added another 140 years of
scientific discoveries to those early insights. ( Polyvagal  refers to the many
branches of the vagus nerve—Darwin’ s “pneumogastric nerve”—which
connects numerous or gans, including the brain, lungs, heart, stomach, and
intestines.) The Polyvagal Theory provided us with a more sophisticated
understanding of the biology of safety and danger , one based on the subtle
interplay between the visceral experiences of our own bodies and the voices
and faces of the people around us. It explained why a kind face or a
soothing tone of voice can dramatically alter the way we feel. It clarified
why knowing that we are seen and heard by the important people in our
lives can make us feel calm and safe, and why being ignored or dismissed
can precipitate rage reactions or mental collapse. It helped us understand
why focused attunement with another person can shift us out of
disor ganized and fearful states.8
In short, Por ges’ s theory made us look beyond the ef fects of fight or
flight and put social relationships front and center in our understanding of

trauma. It also suggested new approaches to healing that focus on
strengthening the body’ s system for regulating arousal.
Human beings are astoundingly attuned to subtle emotional shifts in the
people (and animals) around them. Slight changes in the tension of the
brow , wrinkles around the eyes, curvature of the lips, and angle of the neck
quickly signal to us how comfortable, suspicious, relaxed, or frightened
someone is.9 Our mirror neurons register their inner experience, and our
own bodies make internal adjustments to whatever we notice. Just so, the
muscles of our own faces give others clues about how calm or excited we
feel, whether our heart is racing or quiet, and whether we’re ready to
pounce on them or run away . When the message we receive from another
person is “Y ou’re safe with me,” we relax. If we’re lucky in our
relationships, we also feel nourished, supported, and restored as we look
into the face and eyes of the other .
Our culture teaches us to focus on personal uniqueness, but at a deeper
level we barely exist as individual or ganisms. Our brains are built to help us
function as members of a tribe. W e are part of that tribe even when we are
by ourselves, whether listening to music (that other people created),
watching a basketball game on television (our own muscles tensing as the
players run and jump), or preparing a spreadsheet for a sales meeting
(anticipating the boss’ s reactions). Most of our ener gy is devoted to
connecting with others.
If we look beyond the list of specific symptoms that entail formal
psychiatric diagnoses, we find that almost all mental suf fering involves
either trouble in creating workable and satisfying relationships or
dif ficulties in regulating arousal (as in the case of habitually becoming
enraged, shut down, overexcited, or disor ganized). Usually it’ s a
combination of both. The standard medical focus on trying to discover the
right drug to treat a particular “disorder” tends to distract us from grappling
with how our problems interfere with our functioning as members of our
tribe.
SAFETY AND RECIPROCITY

A few years ago I heard Jerome Kagan, a distinguished emeritus professor
of child psychology at Harvard, say to the Dalai Lama that for every act of
cruelty in this world there are hundreds of small acts of kindness and
connection. His conclusion: “T o be benevolent rather than malevolent is
probably a true feature of our species.” Being able to feel safe with other
people is probably the single most important aspect of mental health; safe
connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying lives. Numerous
studies of disaster response around the globe have shown that social support
is the most powerful protection against becoming overwhelmed by stress
and trauma.
Social support is not the same as merely being in the presence of
others. The critical issue is r ecipr ocity : being truly heard and seen by the
people around us, feeling that we are held in someone else’ s mind and heart.
For our physiology to calm down, heal, and grow we need a visceral feeling
of safety . No doctor can write a prescription for friendship and love: These
are complex and hard-earned capacities. Y ou don’ t need a history of trauma
to feel self-conscious and even panicked at a party with strangers—but
trauma can turn the whole world into a gathering of aliens.
Many traumatized people find themselves chronically out of sync with
the people around them. Some find comfort in groups where they can replay
their combat experiences, rape, or torture with others who have similar
backgrounds or experiences. Focusing on a shared history of trauma and
victimization alleviates their searing sense of isolation, but usually at the
price of having to deny their individual dif ferences: Members can belong
only if they conform to the common code.
Isolating oneself into a narrowly defined victim group promotes a view
of others as irrelevant at best and dangerous at worst, which eventually only
leads to further alienation. Gangs, extremist political parties, and religious
cults may provide solace, but they rarely foster the mental flexibility needed
to be fully open to what life has to of fer and as such cannot liberate their
members from their traumas. W ell-functioning people are able to accept
individual dif ferences and acknowledge the humanity of others.
In the past two decades it has become widely recognized that when
adults or children are too skittish or shut down to derive comfort from
human beings, relationships with other mammals can help. Dogs and horses
and even dolphins of fer less complicated companionship while providing

the necessary sense of safety . Dogs and horses, in particular , are now
extensively used to treat some groups of trauma patients.10
THREE LEVELS OF SAFETY
After trauma the world is experienced with a dif ferent nervous system that
has an altered perception of risk and safety . Por ges coined the word
“neuroception” to describe the capacity to evaluate relative danger and
safety in one’ s environment. When we try to help people with faulty
neuroception, the great challenge is finding ways to  reset their physiology ,
so that their survival mechanisms stop working against them. This means
helping them to respond appropriately to danger but, even more, to recover
the capacity to experience safety , relaxation, and true reciprocity .
I have extensively interviewed and treated six people who survived
plane crashes. T wo reported having lost consciousness during the incident;
even though they were not physically injured, they collapsed mentally . T wo
went into a panic and stayed frantic until well after we had started
treatment. T wo remained calm and resourceful and helped evacuate fellow
passengers from the burning wreckage. I’ve found a similar range of
responses in survivors of rape, car crashes, and torture. In the previous
chapter we saw the radically dif ferent reactions of Stan and Ute as they
relived the highway disaster they’d experienced side by side. What accounts
for this spectrum of responses: focused, collapsed, or frantic?
Por ges’ s theory provides an explanation: The autonomic nervous
system regulates three fundamental physiological states. The level of safety
determines which one of these is activated at any particular time. Whenever
we feel threatened, we instinctively turn to the first level, social
engagement . W e call out for help, support, and comfort from the people
around us. But if no one comes to our aid, or we’re in immediate danger ,
the or ganism reverts to a more primitive way to survive: fight or flight.  W e
fight of f our attacker , or we run to a safe place. However , if this fails—we
can’ t get away , we’re held down or trapped—the or ganism tries to preserve
itself by shutting down and expending as little ener gy as possible. W e are
then in a state of fr eeze  or collapse .

This is where the many-branched vagus nerve comes in, and I’ll
describe its anatomy briefly because it’ s central to understanding how
people deal with trauma. The social-engagement system depends on nerves
that have their origin in the brain stem regulatory centers,  primarily the
vagus—also known as the tenth cranial nerve—together with adjoining
nerves that activate the muscles of the face, throat, middle ear , and voice
box or larynx. When the “ventral vagal complex” (VVC) runs the show , we
smile when others smile at us, we nod our heads when we agree, and we
frown when friends tell us of their misfortunes. When the VVC is engaged,
it also sends signals down to our heart and lungs, slowing down our heart
rate and increasing the depth of breathing. As a result, we feel calm and
relaxed, centered, or pleasurably aroused.
The many-branched vagus.  The vagus nerve (which Darwin called the pneumogastric nerve)
registers heartbreak and gut-wrenching feelings. When a person becomes upset, the throat gets

dry , the voice becomes tense, the heart speeds up, and respiration becomes rapid and shallow .

2.  Fight or flight: T eeth bared, the face of rage and terror . SNS.
3.  Collapse: The body signals defeat and withdraws. DVC.
Any threat to our safety or social connections triggers changes in the
areas innervated by the VVC. When something distressing happens, we
automatically signal our upset in our facial expressions and tone of voice,
changes meant to beckon others to come to our assistance.1 1 However , if no
one responds to our call for help, the threat increases, and the older limbic
brain jumps in. The sympathetic nervous system takes over , mobilizing
muscles, heart, and lungs for fight or flight.12 Our voice becomes faster and
more strident and our heart starts pumping faster . If a dog is in the room,
she will stir and growl, because she can smell the activation of our sweat
glands.
Finally , if there’ s no way out, and there’ s nothing we can do to stave of f
the inevitable, we will activate the ultimate emer gency system: the dorsal
vagal complex (DVC). This system reaches down below the diaphragm to
the stomach, kidneys, and intestines and drastically reduces metabolism
throughout the body . Heart rate plunges (we feel our heart “drop”), we can’ t
breathe, and our gut stops working or empties (literally “scaring the shit out
of” us). This is the point at which we disengage, collapse, and freeze.
FIGHT OR FLIGHT VERSUS COLLAPSE

As we saw in Stan’ s and Ute’ s brain scans, trauma is expressed not only as
fight or flight but also as shutting down and failing to engage in the present.
A dif ferent level of brain activity is involved for each response: the
mammalian fight-or -flight system, which is protective and keeps us from
shutting down, and the reptilian brain, which produces the collapse
response. Y ou can see the dif ference between these two systems at any big
pet store. Kittens, puppies, mice and gerbils constantly play around, and
when they’re tired they huddle together , skin to skin, in a pile. In contrast,
the snakes and lizards lie motionless in the corners of their cages,
unresponsive to the environment.13 This sort of immobilization, generated
by the reptilian brain, characterizes many chronically traumatized people, as
opposed to the mammalian panic and rage that make more recent trauma
survivors so frightened and frightening.
Almost everyone knows what that quintessential fight/flight response,
road rage, feels like: A sudden threat precipitates an intense impulse to
move and attack. Danger turns of f our social-engagement system, decreases
our responsiveness to the human voice, and increases our sensitivity to
threatening sounds. Y et for many people panic and rage are preferable to the
opposite: shutting down and becoming dead to the world. Activating
flight/flight at least makes them feel ener gized. That is why so many abused
and traumatized people feel fully alive in the face of actual danger , while
they go numb in situations that are more complex but objectively safe, like
birthday parties or family dinners.
When fighting or running does not take care of the threat, we activate
the last resort—the reptilian brain, the ultimate emer gency system. This
system is most likely to engage when we are physically immobilized, as
when we are pinned down by an attacker or when a child has no escape
from a terrifying caregiver . Collapse and disengagement are controlled by
the DVC, an evolutionarily ancient part of the parasympathetic nervous
system that is associated with digestive symptoms like diarrhea and nausea.
It also slows down the heart and induces shallow breathing. Once this
system takes over , other people,  and we ourselves, cease to matter .
A wareness is shut down, and we may no longer even register physical pain.
HOW WE BECOME HUMAN

In Por ges’ s grand theory the VVC evolved in mammals to support an
increasingly complex social life. All mammals, including human beings,
band together to mate, nurture their young, defend against common
enemies, and coordinate hunting and food acquisition.  The more ef ficiently
the VVC synchronizes the activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems, the better the physiology of each individual will be
attuned to that of other members of the tribe.
Thinking about the VVC in this way illuminates how parents naturally
help their kids to regulate themselves. Newborn babies are not very social;
they sleep most of the time and wake up when they’re hungry or wet. After
having been fed they may spend a little time looking around, fussing, or
staring, but they will soon be asleep again, following their own internal
rhythms. Early in life they are pretty much at the mercy of the alternating
tides of their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and their
reptilian brain runs most of the show .
But day by day , as we coo and smile and cluck at them, we stimulate
the growth of synchronicity in the developing VVC. These interactions help
to bring our babies’ emotional arousal systems into sync with their
surroundings. The VVC controls sucking, swallowing, facial expression,
and the sounds produced by the larynx. When these functions are stimulated
in an infant, they are accompanied by a sense of pleasure and safety , which
helps create the foundation for all future social behavior .14 As my friend Ed
T ronick taught me a long time ago, the brain is a cultural or gan—
experience shapes the brain.
Being in tune with other members of our species via the VVC is
enormously rewarding. What begins as the attuned play of mother and child
continues with the rhythmicity of a good basketball game, the synchrony of
tango dancing, and the harmony of choral singing or playing a piece of jazz
or chamber music—all of which foster a deep sense of pleasure and
connection.
W e can speak of trauma when that system fails: when you beg for your
life, but the assailant ignores your pleas; when you are a terrified child lying
in bed, hearing your mother scream as her boyfriend beats her up; when you
see your buddy trapped under a piece of metal that you’re not strong
enough to lift; when you want to push away the priest who is abusing you,

but you’re afraid you’ll be punished. Immobilization is at the root of most
traumas. When that occurs the DVC is likely to take over: Y our heart slows
down, your breathing becomes shallow , and, zombielike, you lose touch
with yourself and your surroundings. Y ou dissociate, faint and collapse.
DEFEND OR RELAX?
Steve Por ges helped me realize that the natural state of mammals is to be
somewhat on guard. However , in order to feel emotionally close to another
human being, our defensive system must temporarily shut down. In order to
play , mate, and nurture our young, the brain needs to turn of f its natural
vigilance.
Many traumatized individuals are too hypervigilant to enjoy the
ordinary pleasures that life has to of fer , while others are too numb to absorb
new experiences—or to be alert to signs of real danger . When the smoke
detectors of the brain malfunction, people no longer run when they should
be trying to escape or fight back when they should be defending
themselves. The landmark ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) study ,
which I’ll discuss in more detail in chapter 9, showed that women who had
an early history of abuse and neglect were seven times more likely to be
raped in adulthood. W omen who, as children, had witnessed their mothers
being assaulted by their partners had a vastly increased chance to fall victim
to domestic violence.15
Many people feel safe as long as they can limit their social contact to
superficial conversations, but actual physical contact can trigger intense
reactions. However , as Por ges points out, achieving any sort of deep
intimacy—a close embrace, sleeping with a mate, and sex—requires
allowing oneself to experience immobilization without fear .16 It is
especially challenging for traumatized people to discern when they are
actually safe and to be able to activate their defenses when they are in
danger . This requires having experiences that can restore the sense of
physical safety , a topic to which we’ll return many times in the chapters that
follow .

NEW APPROACHES T O TREA TMENT
If we understand that traumatized children and adults get stuck in
fight/flight or in chronic shut-down, how do we help them to deactivate
these defensive maneuvers that once ensured their survival?
Some gifted people who work with trauma survivors know how to do
this intuitively . Steve Gross used to run the play program at the T rauma
Center . Steve often walked around the clinic with a brightly colored beach
ball, and when he saw angry or frozen kids in the waiting room, he would
flash them a big smile. The kids rarely responded. Then, a little later , he
would return and “accidentally” drop his ball close to where a kid was
sitting. As Steve leaned over to pick it up, he’d nudge it gently toward the
kid, who’d usually give a halfhearted push in return. Gradually Steve got a
back-and-forth going, and before long you’d see smiles on both faces.
From simple, rhythmically attuned movements, Steve had created a
small, safe place where the social-engagement system could begin to
reemer ge. In the same way , severely traumatized people may get more out
of simply helping to arrange chairs before a meeting or joining others in
tapping out a musical rhythm on the chair seats than they would from sitting
in those same chairs and discussing the failures in their life.
One thing is certain: Y elling at someone who is already out of control
can only lead to further dysregulation. Just as your dog cowers if you shout
and wags his tail when you speak in a high singsong, we humans respond to
harsh voices with fear , anger , or shutdown and to playful tones by opening
up and relaxing. W e simply cannot help but respond to these indicators of
safety or danger .
Sadly , our educational system, as well as many of the methods that
profess to treat trauma, tend to bypass this emotional-engagement system
and focus instead on recruiting the cognitive capacities of the mind. Despite
the well-documented ef fects of anger , fear , and anxiety on the ability to
reason, many programs continue to ignore the need to engage the safety
system of the brain before trying to promote new ways of thinking. The last
things that should be cut from school schedules are chorus, physical
education, recess, and anything else involving movement, play , and joyful
engagement. When children are oppositional, defensive, numbed out, or
enraged, it’ s also important to recognize that such “bad behavior” may

repeat action patterns that were established to survive serious threats, even
if they are intensely upsetting or of f-putting.
Por ges’ s work has had a profound ef fect on how my T rauma Center
colleagues and I or ganize the treatment of abused children and traumatized
adults. It’ s true that we would probably have developed a therapeutic yoga
program for women at some point, given that yoga had proved so successful
in helping them calm down and get in touch with their dissociated bodies.
W e would also have been likely to experiment with a theater program in the
Boston inner -city schools, with a karate program for rape survivors called
impact model mugging, and with play techniques and body modalities like
sensory stimulation that have now been used with survivors around the
world. (All of these and more will be explored in part 5.)
But the polyvagal theory helped us understand and explain why  all
these disparate, unconventional techniques worked so well. It enabled us to
become more conscious of combining top-down approaches (to activate
social engagement) with bottom-up methods (to calm the physical tensions
in the body). W e were more open to the value of other age-old,
nonpharmacological approaches to health that have long been practiced
outside W estern medicine, ranging from breath exercises (pranayama) and
chanting to martial arts like qigong to drumming and group singing and
dancing. All rely on interpersonal rhythms, visceral awareness, and vocal
and facial communication, which help shift people out of fight/flight states,
reor ganize their perception of danger , and increase their capacity to manage
relationships.
The body keeps the score:17 If the memory of trauma is encoded in the
viscera, in heartbreaking and gut-wrenching emotions, in autoimmune
disorders and skeletal/muscular problems, and if mind/brain/visceral
communication is the royal road to emotion regulation, this demands a
radical shift in our therapeutic assumptions.

herry walked into my of fice with her shoulders slumped ,  her chin
nearly touching her chest. Even before we spoke a word, her body was
telling me that she was afraid to face the world. I also noticed that her long
sleeves only partially covered the scabs on her forearms. After sitting down,
she told me in a high-pitched monotone that she couldn’ t stop herself from
picking at the skin on her arms and chest until she bled.
As far back as Sherry could remember , her mother had run a foster
home, and their house was often packed with as many as fifteen strange,
disruptive, frightened, and frightening kids who disappeared as suddenly as
they arrived. Sherry had grown up taking care of these transient children,
feeling that there was no room for her and her needs. “I know I wasn’ t
wanted,” she told me. “I’m not sure when I first realized that, but I’ve
thought about things that my mother said to me, and the signs were always
there. She’d tell me, ‘Y ou know , I don’ t think you belong in this family . I
think they gave us the wrong baby .’ And she’d say it with a smile on her

face. But, of course, people often pretend to joke when they say something
serious.”
Over the years our research team has repeatedly found that chronic
emotional abuse and neglect can be just as devastating as physical abuse
and sexual molestation.1 Sherry turned out to be a living example of these
findings: Not being seen, not being known, and having nowhere to turn to
feel safe is devastating at any age, but it is particularly destructive for
young children, who are still trying to find their place in the world.
Sherry had graduated from college, but she now worked in a joyless
clerical job, lived alone with her cats, and had no close friends. When I
asked her about men, she told me that her only “relationship” had been with
a man who’d kidnapped her while she was on a college vacation in Florida.
He’d held her captive and raped her repeatedly for five consecutive days.
She remembered having been curled up, terrified and frozen for most of that
time, until she realized she could try to get away . She escaped by simply
walking out while he was in the bathroom. When she called her mother
collect for help, her mother refused to take the call. Sherry finally managed
to get home with assistance from a domestic violence shelter .
Sherry told me that she’d started to pick at her skin because it gave her
some relief from feeling numb. The physical sensations made her feel more
alive but also deeply ashamed—she knew she was addicted to these actions
but could not stop them. She’d consulted many mental health professionals
before me and had been questioned repeatedly about her “suicidal
behavior .” She’d also been subjected to involuntary hospitalization by a
psychiatrist who refused to treat her unless she could promise that she
would never pick at herself again. However , in my experience, patients who
cut themselves or pick at their skin like Sherry , are seldom suicidal but are
trying to make themselves feel better in the only way they know .
This is a dif ficult concept for many people to understand. As I
discussed in the previous chapter , the most common response to distress is
to seek out people we like and trust to help us and give us the courage to go
on. W e may also calm down by engaging in a physical activity like biking
or going to the gym. W e start learning these ways of regulating our feelings
from the first moment someone feeds us when we’re hungry , covers us
when we’re cold, or rocks us when we’re hurt or scared.

But if no one has ever looked at you with loving eyes or broken out in a
smile when she sees you; if no one has rushed to help you (but instead said,
“Stop crying, or I’ll give you something to cry about”), then you need to
discover other ways of taking care of yourself. Y ou are likely to experiment
with anything—drugs, alcohol, binge eating, or cutting—that of fers some
kind of relief.
While Sherry dutifully came to every appointment and answered my
questions with great sincerity , I did not feel we were making the sort of vital
connection that is necessary for therapy to work. Struck by how frozen and
uptight she was, I suggested that she see Liz, a massage therapist I had
worked with previously . During their first meeting Liz positioned Sherry on
the massage table, then moved to the end of the table and gently held
Sherry’ s feet. L ying there with her eyes closed, Sherry suddenly yelled in a
panic: “Where are you?” Somehow Sherry had lost track of Liz, even
though Liz was right there, with her hands on Sherry’ s feet.
Sherry was one of the first patients who taught me about the extreme
disconnection from the body that so many people with histories of trauma
and neglect experience. I discovered that my professional training, with its
focus on understanding and insight, had lar gely ignored the relevance of the
living, breathing body , the foundation of our selves. Sherry knew that
picking her skin was a destructive thing to do and that it was related to her
mother ’ s neglect, but understanding the source of the impulse made no
dif ference in helping her control it.
LOSING YOUR BODY
Once I was alerted to this, I was amazed to discover how many of my
patients told me they could not feel whole areas of their bodies. Sometimes
I’d ask them to close their eyes and tell me what I had put into their
outstretched hands. Whether it was a car key , a quarter , or a can opener ,
they often could not even guess what they were holding—their sensory
perceptions simply weren’ t working.
I talked this over with my friend Alexander McFarlane in Australia,
who had observed the same phenomenon. In his laboratory in Adelaide he
had studied the question: How do we know without looking at it that we’re

holding a car key? Recognizing an object in the palm of your hand requires
sensing its shape, weight, temperature, texture, and position. Each of those
distinct sensory experiences is transmitted to a dif ferent part of the brain,
which then needs to integrate them into a single perception. McFarlane
found that people with PTSD often have trouble putting the picture
together .2
When our senses become muf fled, we no longer feel fully alive. In an
article called “What Is an Emotion?” (1884),3 W illiam James, the father of
American psychology , reported a striking case of “sensory insensibility” in
a woman he interviewed: “I have . . . no human sensations,” she told him.
“[I am] surrounded by all that can render life happy and agreeable, still to
me the faculty of enjoyment and of feeling is wanting. . . . Each of my
senses, each part of my proper self, is as it were separated from me and can
no longer af ford me any feeling; this impossibility seems to depend upon a
void which I feel in the front of my head, and to be due to the diminution of
the sensibility over the whole surface of my body , for it seems to me that I
never actually reach the objects which I touch. All this would be a small
matter enough, but for its frightful result, which is that of the impossibility
of any other kind of feeling and of any sort of enjoyment, although I
experience a need and desire of them that render my life an
incomprehensible torture.”
This response to trauma raises an important question: How can
traumatized people learn to integrate ordinary sensory experiences so that
they can live with the natural flow of feeling and feel secure and complete
in their bodies?
HOW DO WE KNOW WE’RE ALIVE?
Most early neuroimaging studies of traumatized people were like those
we’ve seen in chapter 3; they focused on how subjects reacted to specific
reminders of the trauma. Then, in 2004, my colleague Ruth Lanius, who
scanned Stan and Ute Lawrence’ s brains, posed a new question: What
happens in the brains of trauma survivors when they are not  thinking about
the past? Her studies on the idling brain, the “default state network” (DSN),

opened up a whole new chapter in understanding how trauma af fects self-
awareness, specifically sensory self-awareness.4
Dr . Lanius recruited a group of sixteen “normal” Canadians to lie in a
brain scanner while thinking about nothing in particular . This is not easy for
anyone to do—as long as we are awake, our brains are churning—but she
asked them to focus their attention on their breathing and try to empty their
minds as much as possible. She then repeated the same experiment with
eighteen people who had histories of severe, chronic childhood abuse.
What is your brain doing when you have nothing in particular on your
mind? It turns out that you pay attention to yourself: The default state
activates the brain areas that work together to create your sense of “self.”
When Ruth looked at the scans of her normal subjects, she found
activation of DSN regions that previous researchers had described. I like to
call this the Mohawk of self-awareness, the midline structures of the brain,
starting out right above our eyes, running through the center of the brain all
the way to the back. All these midline structures are involved in our sense
of self. The lar gest bright region at the back of the brain is the posterior
cingulate, which gives us a physical sense of where we are—our internal
GPS. It is strongly connected to the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the
watchtower I discussed in chapter 4. (This connection doesn’ t show up on
the scan because the fMRI can’ t measure it.) It is also connected with brain
areas that register sensations coming from the rest of the body: the insula,
which relays messages from the viscera to the emotional centers; the
parietal lobes, which integrate sensory information; and the anterior
cingulate, which coordinates emotions and thinking. All of these areas
contribute to consciousness.

Locating the self.  The Mohawk of self-awareness. Starting from the front of the brain (at
right), this consists of: the orbital prefrontal cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior
cingulate, the posterior cingulate, and the insula. In individuals with histories of chronic trauma
the same regions show sharply decreased activity , making it dif ficult to register internal states
and assessing the personal relevance of incoming information.
The contrast with the scans of the eighteen chronic PTSD patients with
severe early-life trauma was startling. There was almost no activation of
any of the self-sensing areas of the brain: The MPFC, the anterior cingulate,
the parietal cortex, and the insula did not light up at all; the only area that
showed a slight activation was the posterior cingulate, which is responsible
for basic orientation in space.

There could be only one explanation for such results: In response to the
trauma itself, and in coping with the dread that persisted long afterward,
these patients had learned to shut down the brain areas that transmit the
visceral feelings and emotions that accompany and define terror . Y et in
everyday life, those same brain areas are responsible for registering the
entire range of emotions and sensations that form the foundation of our self-
awareness, our sense of who we are. What we witnessed here was a tragic
adaptation: In an ef fort to shut of f terrifying sensations, they also deadened
their capacity to feel fully alive.
The disappearance of medial prefrontal activation could explain why so
many traumatized people lose their sense of purpose and direction. I used to
be surprised by how often my patients asked me for advice about the most
ordinary things, and then by how rarely they followed it. Now I understood
that their relationship with their own inner reality was impaired. How could
they make decisions, or put any plan into action, if they couldn’ t define
what they wanted or , to be more precise, what the sensations in their bodies,
the basis of all emotions, were trying to tell them?
The lack of self-awareness in victims of chronic childhood trauma is
sometimes so profound that they cannot recognize themselves in a mirror .
Brain scans show that this is not the result of mere inattention: The
structures in char ge of self-recognition may be knocked out along with the
structures related to self-experience.
When Ruth Lanius showed me her study , a phrase from my classical
high school education came back to me. The mathematician Archimedes,
teaching about the lever , is supposed to have said: “Give me a place to stand
and I will move the world.” Or , as the great twentieth-century body
therapist Moshe Feldenkrais put it: “Y ou can’ t do what you want till you
know what you’re doing.” The implications are clear: to feel present you
have to know where you are and be aware of what is going on with you. If
the self-sensing system breaks down we need to find ways to reactivate it.
THE SELF-SENSING SYSTEM
It was fascinating to see how much Sherry benefited from her massage
therapy . She felt more relaxed and adventurous in her day-to-day life and

she was also more relaxed and open with me. She became truly involved in
her therapy and was genuinely curious about her behavior , thoughts, and
feelings. She stopped picking at her skin, and when summer came she
started to spend evenings sitting outside on her stoop, chatting with her
neighbors. She even joined a church choir , a wonderful experience of group
synchrony .
It was at about this time that I met Antonio Damasio at a small think
tank that Dan Schacter , the chair of the psychology department at Harvard,
had or ganized. In a series of brilliant scientific articles and books Damasio
clarified the relationship among body states, emotions, and survival. A
neurologist who has treated hundreds of people with various forms of brain
damage, he became fascinated with consciousness and with identifying the
areas of the brain necessary for knowing what you feel. He has devoted his
career to mapping out what is responsible for our experience of “self.” The
Feeling of What Happens is, for me, his most important book, and reading
it was a revelation.5 Damasio starts by pointing out the deep divide between
our sense of self and the sensory life of our bodies. As he poetically
explains, “Sometimes we use our minds not to discover facts, but to hide
them. . . . One of the things the screen hides most ef fectively is the body ,
our own body , by which I mean the ins of it, its interiors. Like a veil thrown
over the skin to secure its modesty , the screen partially removes from the
mind the inner states of the body , those that constitute the flow of life as it
wanders in the journey of each day .”6
He goes on to describe how this “screen” can work in our favor by
enabling us to attend to pressing problems in the outside world. Y et it has a
cost: “It tends to prevent us from sensing the possible origin and nature of
what we call self.”7 Building on the century-old work of W illiam James,
Damasio ar gues that the core of our self-awareness rests on the physical
sensations that convey the inner states of the body:
[P]rimordial feelings provide a direct experience of one’ s own
living body , wordless, unadorned, and connected to nothing but
sheer existence. These primordial feelings reflect the current state
of the body along varied dimensions, . . . along the scale that
ranges from pleasure to pain, and they originate at the level of the

brain stem rather than the cerebral cortex. All feelings of emotion
are complex musical variations on primordial feelings.8
Our sensory world takes shape even before we are born. In the womb
we feel amniotic fluid against our skin, we hear the faint sounds of rushing
blood and a digestive tract at work, we pitch and roll with our mother ’ s
movements. After birth, physical sensation defines our relationship to
ourselves and to our surroundings. W e start of f being our wetness, hunger ,
satiation, and sleepiness. A cacophony of incomprehensible sounds and
images presses in on our pristine nervous system. Even after we acquire
consciousness and language, our bodily sensing system provides crucial
feedback on our moment-to-moment condition. Its constant hum
communicates changes in our viscera and in the muscles of our face, torso,
and extremities that signal pain and comfort, as well as ur ges such as
hunger and sexual arousal. What is taking place around us also af fects our
physical sensations. Seeing someone we recognize, hearing particular
sounds—a piece of music, a siren—or sensing a shift in temperature all
change our focus of attention and, without our being aware of it, prime our
subsequent thoughts and actions.
As we have seen, the job of the brain is to constantly monitor and
evaluate what is going on within and around us. These evaluations are
transmitted by chemical messages in the bloodstream and electrical
messages in our nerves, causing subtle or dramatic changes throughout the
body and brain. These shifts usually occur entirely without conscious input
or awareness: The subcortical regions of the brain are astoundingly ef ficient
in regulating our breathing, heartbeat, digestion, hormone secretion, and
immune system. However , these systems can become overwhelmed if we
are challenged by an ongoing threat, or even the perception of threat. This
accounts for the wide array of physical problems researchers have
documented in traumatized people.
Y et our conscious self also plays a vital role in maintaining our inner
equilibrium: W e need to register and act on our physical sensations to keep
our bodies safe. Realizing we’re cold compels us to put on a sweater;
feeling hungry or spacey tells us our blood sugar is low and spurs us to get
a snack; the pressure of a full bladder sends us to the bathroom. Damasio

points out that all of the brain structures that register background feelings
are located near areas that control basic housekeeping functions, such as
breathing, appetite, elimination, and sleep/wake cycles: “This is because the
consequences of having emotion and attention are entirely related to the
fundamental business of managing life within the or ganism. It is not
possible to manage life and maintain homeostatic balance without data on
the current state of the or ganism’ s body .”9 Damasio calls these
housekeeping areas of the brain the “proto-self,” because they create the
“wordless knowledge” that underlies our conscious sense of self.
THE SELF UNDER THREA T
In 2000 Damasio and his colleagues published an article in the world’ s
foremost scientific publication, Science , which reported that reliving a
strong negative emotion causes significant changes in the brain areas that
receive nerve signals from the muscles, gut, and skin—areas that are crucial
for regulating basic bodily functions. The team’ s brain scans showed that
recalling an emotional event from the past causes us to actually
reexperience the visceral sensations felt during the original event. Each type
of emotion produced a characteristic pattern, distinct from the others. For
example, a particular part of the brain stem was “active in sadness and
anger , but not in happiness or fear .”10 All of these brain regions are below
the limbic system, to which emotions are traditionally assigned, yet we
acknowledge their involvement every time we use one of the common
expressions that link strong emotions with the body: “Y ou make me sick”;
“It made my skin crawl”; “I was all choked up”; “My heart sank”; “He
makes me bristle.”
The elementary self system in the brain stem and limbic system is
massively activated when people are faced with the threat of annihilation,
which results in an overwhelming sense of fear and terror accompanied by
intense physiological arousal. T o people who are reliving a trauma, nothing
makes sense; they are trapped in a life-or -death situation, a state of
paralyzing fear or blind rage. Mind and body are constantly aroused, as if
they are in imminent danger . They startle in response to the slightest noises
and are frustrated by small irritations. Their sleep is chronically disturbed,

and food often loses its  sensual pleasures. This in turn can trigger desperate
attempts to shut those feelings down by freezing and dissociation.1 1
How do people regain control when their animal brains are stuck in a
fight for survival? If what goes on deep inside our animal brains dictates
how we feel, and if our body sensations are orchestrated by subcortical
(subconscious) brain structures, how much control over them can we
actually have?
AGENCY : OWNING YOUR LIFE
“Agency” is the technical term for the feeling of being in char ge of your
life: knowing where you stand, knowing that you have a say in what
happens to you, knowing that you have some ability to shape your
circumstances. The veterans who put their fists through drywall at the V A
were trying to assert their agency—to make something happen. But they
ended up feeling even more out of control, and many of these once-
confident men were trapped in a cycle between frantic activity and
immobility .
Agency starts with what scientists call interoception, our awareness of
our subtle sensory , body-based feelings: the greater that awareness, the
greater our potential to control our lives. Knowing what  we feel is the first
step to knowing why  we feel that way . If we are aware of the constant
changes in our inner and outer environment ,  we can mobilize to manage
them. But we can’ t do this unless our watchtower , the MPFC, learns to
observe what is going on inside us. This is why mindfulness practice, which
strengthens the MPFC, is a cornerstone of recovery from trauma.12
After I saw the wonderful movie Mar ch of the Penguins , I found
myself thinking about some of my patients. The penguins are stoic and
endearing, and it’ s tragic to learn how , from time immemorial, they have
trudged seventy miles inland from the sea, endured indescribable hardships
to reach their breeding grounds, lost numerous viable eggs to exposure, and
then,  almost starving, dragged themselves back to the ocean. If penguins
had our frontal lobes, they would have used their little flippers to build
igloos, devised a better division of labor , and reor ganized their food
supplies. Many of my patients have survived trauma through tremendous

courage and persistence, only to get into the same kinds of trouble over and
over again. T rauma has shut down their inner compass and robbed them of
the imagination they need to create something better .
The neuroscience of selfhood and agency validates the kinds of somatic
therapies that my friends Peter Levine13 and Pat Ogden14 have developed.
I’ll discuss these and other sensorimotor approaches in more detail in part
V , but in essence their aim is threefold:
to draw out the sensory information that is blocked and frozen
by trauma;
to help patients befriend (rather than suppress) the ener gies
released by that inner experience;
to complete the self-preserving physical actions that were
thwarted when they were trapped, restrained, or immobilized by
terror .
Our gut feelings signal what is safe, life sustaining, or threatening, even
if we cannot quite explain why we feel a particular way . Our sensory
interiority continuously sends us subtle messages about the needs of our
or ganism. Gut feelings also help us to evaluate what is going on around us.
They warn us that the guy who is approaching feels creepy , but they also
convey that a room with western exposure surrounded by daylilies makes us
feel serene. If you have a comfortable connection with  your inner
sensations—if you can trust them to give you accurate information—you
will feel in char ge of your body , your feelings, and your self.
However , traumatized people chronically feel unsafe inside their
bodies: The past is alive in the form of gnawing interior discomfort. Their
bodies are constantly bombarded by visceral warning signs, and, in an
attempt to control these processes, they often become expert at ignoring
their gut feelings and in numbing awareness of what is played out inside.
They learn to hide from their selves.
The more people try to push away and ignore internal warning signs,
the more likely they are to take over and leave them bewildered, confused,
and ashamed. People who cannot comfortably notice what is going on

inside become vulnerable to respond to any sensory shift either by shutting
down or by going into a panic—they develop a fear of fear itself.
W e now know that panic symptoms are maintained lar gely because the
individual develops a fear of the bodily sensations associated with panic
attacks. The attack may be triggered by something he or she knows is
irrational, but fear of the sensations keeps them escalating into a full-body
emer gency . “Scared stif f” and “frozen in fear” (collapsing and going numb)
describe precisely what terror and trauma feel like. They are its  visceral
foundation. The experience of fear derives from primitive responses to
threat where escape is thwarted in some way . People’ s lives will be held
hostage to fear until that visceral experience changes.
The price for ignoring or distorting the body’ s messages is being unable
to detect what is truly dangerous or harmful for you and, just as bad, what is
safe or nourishing. Self-regulation depends on having a friendly
relationship with your body . W ithout it you have to rely on external
regulation—from medication, drugs like alcohol, constant reassurance, or
compulsive compliance with the wishes of others.
Many of my patients respond to stress not by noticing and naming it
but by developing migraine headaches or asthma attacks.15 Sandy , a
middle-aged visiting nurse, told me she’d felt terrified and lonely as a child,
unseen by her alcoholic parents. She dealt with this by becoming deferential
to everybody she depended on (including me, her therapist). Whenever her
husband made an insensitive remark, she would come down with an asthma
attack. By the time she noticed that she couldn’ t breathe, it was too late for
an inhaler to be ef fective, and she had to be taken to the emer gency room.
Suppressing  our inner cries for help does not stop our stress hormones
from mobilizing the body . Even though Sandy had learned to ignore her
relationship problems and block out her physical distress signals, they
showed up in symptoms that demanded her attention. Her therapy focused
on identifying the link between her physical sensations and her emotions,
and I also encouraged her to enroll in a kickboxing program. She had no
emer gency room visits during the three years she was my patient.
Somatic symptoms for which no clear physical basis can be found are
ubiquitous in traumatized children and adults. They can include chronic
back and neck pain, fibromyalgia, migraines, digestive problems, spastic

colon/irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, and some forms of
asthma.16 T raumatized children have fifty times the rate of asthma as their
nontraumatized peers.17 Studies have shown that many children and adults
with fatal asthma attacks were not aware of having breathing problems
before the attacks.
ALEXITHYMIA: NO WORDS FOR FEELINGS
I had a widowed aunt with a painful trauma history who became an
honorary grandmother to our children. She came on frequent visits that
were marked by much doing—making curtains, rearranging kitchen
shelves, sewing children’ s clothes—and very little talking. She was always
eager to please, but it was dif ficult to figure out what she  enjoyed. After
several days of exchanging pleasantries, conversation would come to a halt,
and I’d have to work hard to fill the long silences. On the last day of her
visits I’d drive her to the airport, where she’d give me a stif f good-bye hug
while tears streamed down her face. W ithout a trace of irony she’d then
complain that the cold wind at Logan International Airport made her eyes
water . Her body felt the sadness that her mind couldn’ t register—she was
leaving our young family , her closest living relatives.
Psychiatrists call this phenomenon alexithymia—Greek for not having
words for feelings. Many traumatized children and adults simply cannot
describe what they are feeling because they cannot identify what their
physical sensations mean. They may look furious but deny that they are
angry; they may appear terrified but say that they are fine. Not being able to
discern what is going on inside their bodies causes them to be out of touch
with their needs, and they have trouble taking care of themselves, whether it
involves eating the right amount at the right time or getting the sleep they
need.
Like my aunt, alexithymics substitute the language of action for that of
emotion. When asked, “How would you feel if you saw a truck coming at
you at eighty miles per hour?” most people would say , “I’d be terrified” or
“I’d be frozen with fear .” An alexithymic might reply , “How would I feel? I
don’ t know . . . . I’d get out of the way .”18 They tend to register emotions as
physical problems rather than as signals that something deserves their

attention. Instead of feeling angry or sad, they experience muscle pain,
bowel irregularities, or other symptoms for which no cause can be found.
About three quarters of patients with anorexia nervosa, and more than half
of all patients with bulimia, are bewildered by their emotional feelings and
have great dif ficulty describing them.19 When researchers showed pictures
of angry or distressed faces to people with alexithymia, they could not
figure out what those people were feeling.20
One of the first people who taught me about alexithymia  was the
psychiatrist Henry Krystal, who worked with more than a thousand
Holocaust survivors in his ef fort to understand massive psychic trauma.21
Krystal, himself a concentration camp survivor , found that many of his
patients were professionally successful, but their intimate relationships were
bleak and distant. Suppressing their feelings had made it possible to attend
to the business of the world, but at a price. They learned to shut down their
once overwhelming emotions, and, as a result, they no longer recognized
what they were feeling. Few of them had any interest in therapy .
Paul Frewen at the University of W estern Ontario did a series of brain
scans of people with PTSD who suf fered from alexithymia. One of the
participants told him: “I don’ t know what I feel, it’ s like my head and body
aren’ t connected. I’m living in a tunnel, a fog, no matter what happens it’ s
the same reaction—numbness, nothing. Having a bubble bath and being
burned or raped is the same feeling. My brain doesn’ t feel.” Frewen and his
colleague Ruth Lanius found that the more people were out of touch with
their feelings, the less activity they had in the self-sensing areas of the
brain.22
Because traumatized people often have trouble sensing what is going
on in their bodies, they lack a nuanced response to frustration. They either
react to stress by becoming “spaced out” or with excessive anger . Whatever
their response, they often can’ t tell what is upsetting them. This failure to be
in touch with their bodies contributes to their well-documented lack of self-
protection and high rates of revictimization23 and also to their remarkable
dif ficulties feeling pleasure, sensuality , and having a sense of meaning.
People with alexithymia can get better only by learning to recognize
the relationship between their physical sensations and their emotions, much
as colorblind people can only enter the world of color by learning to

distinguish and appreciate shades of gray . Like my aunt and Henry
Krystal’ s patients, they usually are reluctant to do that: Most seem to have
made an unconscious decision that it is better to keep visiting doctors and
treating ailments that don’ t heal than to do the painful work of facing the
demons of the past.
DEPERSONALIZA TION
One step further down on the ladder to self-oblivion is depersonalization—
losing your sense of yourself. Ute’ s brain scan in chapter 4 is, in its very
blankness, a vivid illustration of depersonalization. Depersonalization is
common during traumatic experiences. I was once mugged late at night in a
park close to my home and, floating above the scene, saw myself lying in
the snow with a small head wound, surrounded by three knife-wielding
teenagers. I dissociated the pain of their stab wounds on my hands and did
not feel the slightest fear as I calmly negotiated for the return of my
emptied wallet.
I did not develop PTSD, partly , I think, because I was intensely curious
about having an experience I had studied so closely in others, and partly
because I had the delusion that I would be able make a drawing of my
muggers to show to the police. Of course, they were never caught, but my
fantasy of revenge must have given me a satisfying sense of agency .
T raumatized people are not so fortunate and feel separated from their
bodies. One particularly good description of depersonalization comes from
the German psychoanalyst Paul Schilder , writing in Berlin in 1928:24 “T o
the depersonalized individual the world appears strange, peculiar , foreign,
dream-like. Objects appear at times strangely diminished in size, at times
flat. Sounds appear to come from a distance. . . . The emotions likewise
under go marked alteration. Patients complain that they are capable of
experiencing neither pain nor pleasure. . . . They have become strangers to
themselves.”
I was fascinated to learn that a group of neuroscientists at the
University of Geneva25 had induced similar out-of-body experiences by
delivering mild electric current to a specific spot in the brain, the temporal
parietal junction. In one patient this produced a sensation that she was

hanging from the ceiling, looking down at her body; in another it induced
an eerie feeling that someone was standing behind her . This research
confirms what our patients tell us: that the self can be detached from the
body and live a phantom existence on its own. Similarly , Lanius and
Frewen, as well as a group of researchers at the University of Groningen in
the Netherlands,26 did brain scans on people who dissociated their terror
and found that the fear centers of the brain simply shut down as they
recalled the event.
BEFRIENDING THE BODY
T rauma victims cannot recover until they become familiar with and
befriend the sensations in their bodies. Being frightened means that you live
in a body that is always on guard. Angry people live in angry bodies. The
bodies of child-abuse victims are tense and defensive until they find a way
to relax and feel safe. In order to change, people need to become aware of
their sensations and the way that their bodies interact with the world around
them. Physical self-awareness is the first step in releasing the tyranny of the
past.
How can people open up to and explore their internal world of
sensations and emotions? In my practice I begin the process by helping my
patients to first notice and then describe the feelings in their bodies—not
emotions such as anger or anxiety or fear but the physical sensations
beneath the emotions: pressure, heat, muscular tension, tingling, caving in,
feeling hollow , and so on. I also work on identifying the sensations
associated with relaxation or pleasure. I help them become aware of their
breath, their gestures and movements. I ask them to pay attention to subtle
shifts in their bodies, such as tightness in their chests or gnawing in their
bellies, when they talk about negative events that they claim did not bother
them.
Noticing sensations for the first time can be quite distressing, and it
may precipitate flashbacks in which people curl up or assume defensive
postures. These are somatic reenactments of the undigested trauma and
most likely represent the postures they assumed when the trauma occurred.
Images and physical sensations may deluge patients at this point, and the

therapist must be familiar with ways to stem torrents of sensation and
emotion to prevent them from becoming retraumatized by accessing the
past. (Schoolteachers, nurses, and police of ficers are often very skilled at
soothing terror reactions because many of them are confronted almost daily
with out-of-control or painfully disor ganized people.)
All too often, however , drugs such as Abilify , Zyprexa, and Seroquel,
are prescribed instead of teaching people the skills to deal with such
distressing physical reactions. Of course, medications only blunt sensations
and do nothing to resolve them or transform them from toxic agents into
allies.
The most natural way for human beings to calm themselves when they
are upset is by clinging to another person. This means that patients who
have been physically or sexually violated face a dilemma: They desperately
crave touch while simultaneously being terrified of body contact. The mind
needs to be reeducated to feel physical sensations, and the body needs to be
helped to tolerate and enjoy the comforts of touch. Individuals who lack
emotional awareness are able, with practice, to connect their physical
sensations to psychological events. Then they can slowly reconnect with
themselves.27
CONNECTING WITH YOURSELF , CONNECTING WITH
OTHERS
I’ll end this chapter with one final study that demonstrates the cost of losing
your body . After Ruth Lanius and her group scanned the idling brain, they
focused on another question from everyday life: What happens in
chronically traumatized people when they make face-to-face contact?
Many patients who come to my of fice are unable to make eye contact. I
immediately know how distressed they are by their dif ficulty meeting my
gaze. It always turns out that they feel disgusting and that they can’ t stand
having me see how despicable they are. It never occurred to me that these
intense feelings of shame would be reflected in abnormal brain activation.
Ruth Lanius once again showed that mind and brain are indistinguishable—
what happens in one is registered in the other .

Ruth bought an expensive device that presents a video character to a
person lying in a scanner . (In this case, the cartoon resembled a kindly
Richard Gere.) The figure can approach either head on (looking directly at
the person) or at a forty-five-degree angle with an averted gaze. This made
it possible to compare the ef fects of direct eye contact on brain activation
with those of an averted gaze.28
The most striking dif ference between normal controls and survivors of
chronic trauma was in activation of the prefrontal cortex in response to a
direct eye gaze. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) normally helps us to assess the
person coming toward us, and our mirror neurons help to pick up his
intentions. However , the subjects with PTSD did not activate any part of
their frontal lobe, which means they could not muster any curiosity about
the stranger . They just reacted with intense activation deep inside their
emotional brains, in the primitive areas known as the Periaqueductal Gray ,
which generates startle, hypervigilance, cowering, and other self-protective
behaviors. There was no activation of any part of the brain involved in
social engagement. In response to being looked at they simply went into
survival mode.
What does this mean for their ability to make friends and get along
with others? What does it mean for their therapy? Can people with PTSD
trust a therapist with their deepest fears? T o have genuine relationships you
have to be able to experience others as separate individuals, each with his or
her particular motivations and intentions. While you need to be able to
stand up for yourself, you also need to recognize that other people have
their own agendas. T rauma can make all that hazy and gray .

The roots of resilience . . . are to be found in the sense of being
understood by and existing in the mind and heart of a loving,
attuned, and self-possessed other .
—Diana Fosha
he Children’ s Clinic at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center was
filled with disturbed and disturbing kids. They were wild creatures who
could not sit still and who hit and bit other children, and sometimes even
the staf f. They would run up to you and cling to you one moment and run
away , terrified, the next. Some masturbated compulsively; others lashed out
at objects, pets, and themselves. They were at once starving for af fection
and angry and defiant. The girls in particular could be painfully compliant.
Whether oppositional or clingy , none of them seemed able to explore or
play in ways typical for children their age. Some of them had hardly
developed a sense of self—they couldn’ t even recognize themselves in a
mirror .
At the time, I knew very little about children, apart from what my two
preschoolers were teaching me. But I was fortunate in my colleague Nina
Fish-Murray , who had studied with Jean Piaget in Geneva, in addition to

raising five children of her own. Piaget based his theories of child
development on meticulous, direct observation of children themselves,
starting with his own infants, and Nina brought this spirit to the incipient
T rauma Center at MMHC.
Nina was married to the former chairman of the Harvard psychology
department, Henry Murray , one of the pioneers of personality theory , and
she actively encouraged any junior faculty members who shared her
interests. She was fascinated by my stories about combat veterans because
they reminded her of the troubled kids she worked with in the Boston public
schools. Nina’ s privileged position and personal charm gave us access to
the Children’ s Clinic, which was run by child psychiatrists who had little
interest in trauma.
Henry Murray had, among other things, become famous for designing
the widely used Thematic Apperception T est. The T A T is a so-called
projective test, which uses a set of cards to discover how people’ s inner
reality shapes their view of the world. Unlike the Rorschach cards we used
with the veterans, the T A T cards depict realistic but ambiguous and
somewhat troubling scenes: a man and a woman gloomily staring away
from each other , a boy looking at a broken violin. Subjects are asked to tell
stories about what is going on in the photo, what has happened previously ,
and what happens next. In most cases their interpretations quickly reveal
the themes that preoccupy them.
Nina and I decided to create a set of test cards specifically for children,
based on pictures we cut out of magazines in the clinic waiting room. Our
first study compared twelve six- to eleven-year -olds at the children’ s clinic
with a group of children from a nearby school who matched them as closely
as possible in age, race, intelligence, and family constellation.1 What
dif ferentiated our patients was the abuse they had suf fered within their
families. They included a boy who was severely bruised from repeated
beatings by his mother; a girl whose father had molested her at the age of
four; two boys who had been repeatedly tied to a chair and whipped; and a
girl who, at the age of five, had seen her mother (a prostitute) raped,
dismembered, burned, and put into the trunk of a car . The mother ’ s pimp
was suspected of sexually abusing the girl.

The children in our control group also lived in poverty in a depressed
area of Boston where they regularly witnessed shocking violence. While the
study was being conducted , one boy at their school threw gasoline at a
classmate and set him on fire. Another boy was caught in crossfire while
walking to school with his father and a friend. He was wounded in the
groin, and his friend was killed. Given their exposure to such a high
baseline level of violence, would their responses to the cards dif fer from
those of the hospitalized children?
One of our cards depicted a family scene: two smiling kids watching
dad repair a car . Every child who looked at it commented on the danger to
the man lying underneath the vehicle. While the control children told stories
with benign endings—the car would get fixed, and maybe dad and the kids
would drive to McDonald’ s—the traumatized kids came up with gruesome
tales. One girl said that the little girl in the picture was about to smash in
her father ’ s skull with a hammer . A nine-year -old boy who had been
severely physically abused told an elaborate story about how the boy in the
picture kicked away the jack, so that the car mangled his father ’ s body and
his blood spurted all over the garage.


As they told us these stories, our patients got very excited and
disor ganized. W e had to take considerable time out at the water cooler and
going for walks before we could show them the next card. It was little
wonder that almost all of them had been diagnosed with ADHD, and most
were on Ritalin—though the drug certainly didn’ t seem to dampen their
arousal in this situation.
The abused kids gave similar responses to a seemingly innocuous
picture of a pregnant woman silhouetted against a window . When we
showed it to the seven-year -old girl who’d been sexually abused at age four ,
she talked about penises and vaginas and repeatedly asked Nina questions
like “How many people have you humped?” Like several of the other
sexually abused girls in the study , she became so agitated that we had to
stop. A seven-year -old girl from the control group picked up the wistful
mood of the picture: Her story was about a widowed lady sadly looking out
the window , missing her husband. But in the end, the lady found a loving
man to be a good father to her baby .

In card after card we saw that, despite their alertness to trouble, the
children who had not been abused still trusted in an essentially benign
universe; they could imagine ways out of bad situations. They seemed to
feel protected and safe within their own families. They also felt loved by at
least one of their parents, which seemed to make a substantial dif ference in
their eagerness to engage in schoolwork and to learn.
The responses of the clinic children were alarming. The most innocent
images stirred up intense feelings of danger , aggression, sexual arousal, and
terror . W e had not selected these photos because they had some hidden
meaning that sensitive people could uncover; they were ordinary images of
everyday life. W e could only conclude that for abused children, the whole
world is filled with triggers. As long as they can imagine only disastrous

outcomes to relatively benign situations, anybody walking into a room, any
stranger , any image, on a screen or on a billboard might be perceived as a
harbinger of catastrophe. In this light the bizarre behavior of the kids at the
children’ s clinic made perfect sense.2
T o my amazement, staf f discussions on the unit rarely mentioned the
horrific real-life experiences of the children and the impact of those traumas
on their feelings, thinking, and self-regulation. Instead, their medical
records were filled with diagnostic labels: “conduct disorder” or
“oppositional defiant disorder” for the angry and rebellious kids; or “bipolar
disorder .” ADHD was a “comorbid” diagnosis for almost all. W as the
underlying trauma being obscured by this blizzard of diagnoses?
Now we faced two big challenges. One was to learn whether the
dif ferent worldview of normal children could account for their resilience
and, on a deeper level, how each child actually creates her map of the
world. The other , equally crucial, question was: Is it possible to help the
minds and brains of brutalized children to redraw their inner maps and
incorporate a sense of trust and confidence in the future?
MEN WITHOUT MOTHERS
The scientific study of the vital relationship between infants and their
mothers was started by upper -class Englishmen who were torn from their
families as young boys to be sent of f to boarding schools, where they were
raised in regimented same-sex settings. The first time I visited the famed
T avistock Clinic in London I noticed a collection of black-and-white
photographs of these great twentieth-century psychiatrists hanging on the
wall going up the main staircase: John Bowlby , W ilfred Bion, Harry
Guntrip, Ronald Fairbairn, and Donald W innicott. Each of them, in his own
way , had explored how our early experiences become prototypes for all our
later connections with others, and how our most intimate sense of self is
created in our minute-to-minute exchanges with our caregivers.
Scientists study what puzzles them most, so that they often become
experts in subjects that others take for granted. (Or , as the attachment
researcher Beatrice Beebe once told me, “most research is me-search.”)
These men who studied the role of mothers in children’ s lives had

themselves been sent of f to school at a vulnerable age, sometime between
six and ten, long before they should have faced the world alone. Bowlby
himself told me that just such boarding-school experiences probably
inspired Geor ge Orwell’ s novel 1984 , which brilliantly expresses how
human beings may be induced to sacrifice everything they hold dear and
true—including their sense of self—for the sake of being loved and
approved of by someone in a position of authority .
Since Bowlby was close friends with the Murrays, I had a chance to
talk with him about his work whenever he visited Harvard. He was born
into an aristocratic family (his father was sur geon to the King’ s household),
and he trained in psychology , medicine, and psychoanalysis at the temples
of the British establishment. After attending Cambridge University , he
worked with delinquent boys in London’ s East End, a notoriously rough
and crime-ridden neighborhood that was lar gely destroyed during the Blitz.
During and after his service in W orld W ar II, he observed the ef fects of
wartime evacuations and group nurseries that separated young children
from their families. He also studied the ef fect of hospitalization, showing
that even brief separations (parents back then were not allowed to visit
overnight) compounded the children’ s suf fering. By the late 1940s Bowlby
had become persona non grata  in the British psychoanalytic community , as
a result of his radical claim that children’ s disturbed behavior was a
response to actual life experiences—to neglect, brutality , and separation—
rather than the product of infantile sexual fantasies. Undaunted, he devoted
the rest of his life to developing what came to be called attachment theory .3
A SECURE BASE
As we enter this world we scream to announce our presence. Someone
immediately engages with us, bathes us, swaddles us, and fills our
stomachs, and, best of all, our mother may put us on her belly or breast for
delicious skin-to-skin contact. W e are profoundly social creatures; our lives
consist of finding our place within the community of human beings. I love
the expression of the great French psychiatrist Pierre Janet: “Every life is a
piece of art, put together with all means available.”

As we grow up, we gradually learn to take care of ourselves, both
physically and emotionally , but we get our first lessons in self-care from the
way that we are cared for . Mastering the skill of self-regulation depends to
a lar ge degree on how harmonious our early interactions with our caregivers
are. Children whose parents are reliable sources of comfort and strength
have a lifetime advantage—a kind of buf fer against the worst that fate can
hand them.
John Bowlby realized that children are captivated by faces and voices
and are exquisitely sensitive to facial expression, posture, tone of voice,
physiological changes, tempo of movement and incipient action. He saw
this inborn capacity as a product of evolution, essential to the survival of
these helpless creatures. Children are also programmed to choose one
particular adult (or at most a few) with whom their natural communication
system develops. This creates a primary attachment bond. The more
responsive the adult is to the child, the deeper the attachment and the more
likely the child will develop healthy ways of responding to the people
around him.
Bowlby would often visit Regent’ s Park in London, where he would
make systematic observations of the interactions between children and their
mothers. While the mothers sat quietly on park benches, knitting or reading
the paper , the kids would wander of f to explore, occasionally looking over
their shoulders to ascertain that Mum was still watching. But when a
neighbor stopped by and absorbed his mother ’ s interest with the latest
gossip, the kids would run back and stay close, making sure he still had her
attention. When infants and young children notice that their mothers are not
fully engaged with them,  they become nervous. When their mothers
disappear from sight, they may cry and become inconsolable, but as soon as
their mothers return, they quiet down and resume their play .
Bowlby saw attachment as the secure base from which a child moves
out into the world. Over the subsequent five decades research has firmly
established that having a safe haven promotes self-reliance and instills a
sense of sympathy and helpfulness to others in distress. From the intimate
give-and-take of the attachment bond children learn that other people have
feelings and thoughts that are both similar to and dif ferent from theirs. In
other words, they get “in sync” with their environment and with the people
around them and develop the self-awareness, empathy , impulse control, and

self-motivation that make it possible to become contributing members of
the lar ger social culture. These qualities were painfully missing in the kids
at our Children’ s Clinic.
THE DANCE OF A TTUNEMENT
Children become attached to whoever functions as their primary caregiver .
But the nature of that attachment—whether it is secure or insecure—makes
a huge dif ference over the course of a child’ s life. Secure attachment
develops when caregiving includes emotional attunement. Attunement
starts at the most subtle physical levels of interaction between babies and
their caretakers, and it gives babies the feeling of being met and understood.
As Edinbur gh-based attachment researcher Colwyn T revarthen says: “The
brain coordinates rhythmic body movements and guides them to act in
sympathy with other people’ s brains. Infants hear and learn musicality from
their mother ’ s talk, even before birth.”4
In chapter 4 I described the discovery of mirror neurons, the brain-to-
brain links that give us our capacity for empathy . Mirror neurons start
functioning as soon as babies are born. When researcher Andrew Meltzof f
at the University of Oregon pursed his lips or stuck out his tongue at six-
hour -old babies, they promptly mirrored his actions.5 (Newborns can focus
their eyes only on objects within eight to twelve inches—just enough see
the person who is holding them). Imitation is our most fundamental social
skill. It assures that we automatically pick up and reflect the behavior of our
parents, teachers, and peers.
Most parents relate to their babies so spontaneously that they are barely
aware of how attunement unfolds. But an invitation from a friend, the
attachment researcher Ed T ronick, gave me the chance to observe that
process more closely . Through a one-way mirror at Harvard’ s Laboratory of
Human Development, I watched a mother playing with her two-month-old
son, who was propped in an infant seat facing her .
They were cooing to each other and having a wonderful time—until the
mother leaned in to nuzzle him and the baby , in his excitement, yanked on
her hair . The mother was caught unawares and yelped with pain, pushing
away his hand while her face contorted with anger . The baby let go

immediately , and they pulled back physically from each other . For both of
them the source of delight had become a source of distress. Obviously
frightened, the baby brought his hands up to his face to block out the sight
of his angry mother . The mother , in turn, realizing that her baby was upset,
refocused on him, making soothing sounds in an attempt to smooth things
over . The infant still had his eyes covered, but his craving for connection
soon reemer ged. He started peeking out to see if the coast was clear , while
his mother reached toward him with a concerned expression. As she started
to tickle his belly , he dropped his arms and broke into a happy giggle, and
harmony was reestablished. Infant and mother were attuned again. This
entire sequence of delight, rupture, repair , and new delight took slightly less
than twelve seconds.
T ronick and other researchers have now shown that when infants and
caregivers are in sync on an emotional level, they’re also in sync
physically .6 Babies can’ t regulate their own emotional states, much less the
changes in heart rate, hormone levels, and nervous-system activity that
accompany emotions. When a child is in sync with his caregiver , his sense
of joy and connection is reflected in his steady heartbeat and breathing and
a low level of stress hormones .  His body is calm; so are his emotions. The
moment this music is disrupted—as it often is in the course of a normal day
—all these physiological factors change as well. Y ou can tell equilibrium
has been restored when the physiology calms down.
W e soothe newborns, but parents soon start teaching their children to
tolerate higher levels of arousal, a job that is often assigned to fathers. (I
once heard the psychologist John Gottman say , “Mothers stroke, and fathers
poke.”) Learning how to manage arousal is a key life skill, and parents must
do it for babies before babies can do it for themselves. If that gnawing
sensation in his belly makes a baby cry , the breast or bottle arrives. If he’ s
scared, someone holds and rocks him until he calms down. If his bowels
erupt, someone comes to make him clean and dry . Associating intense
sensations with safety , comfort, and mastery is the foundation of self-
regulation, self-soothing, and self-nurture, a theme to which I return
throughout this book.
A secure attachment combined with the cultivation of competency
builds an internal locus of contr ol, the key factor in healthy coping

throughout life.7 Securely attached children learn what makes them feel
good; they discover what makes them (and others) feel bad, and they
acquire a sense of agency: that their actions can change how they feel and
how others respond. Securely attached kids learn the dif ference between
situations they can control and situations where they need help. They learn
that they can play an active role when faced with dif ficult situations. In
contrast, children with histories of abuse and neglect learn that their terror ,
pleading, and crying do not register with their caregiver . Nothing they can
do or say stops the beating or brings attention and help. In ef fect they’re
being conditioned to give up when they face challenges later in life.
BECOMING REAL
Bowlby’ s contemporary , the pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald
W innicott, is the father of modern studies of attunement. His minute
observations of mothers and children started with the way mothers hold
their babies. He proposed that these physical interactions lay the
groundwork for a baby’ s sense of self—and, with that, a lifelong sense of
identity . The way a mother holds her child underlies “the ability to feel the
body as the place where the psyche lives.”8 This visceral and kinesthetic
sensation of how our bodies are met lays the foundation for what we
experience as “real.”9
W innicott thought that the vast majority of mothers did just fine in their
attunement to their infants—it does not require extraordinary talent to be
what he called a “good enough mother .”10 But things can go seriously
wrong when mothers are unable to tune in to their baby’ s physical reality . If
a mother cannot meet her baby’ s impulses and needs, “the baby learns to
become the mother ’ s idea of what the baby is.” Having to discount its inner
sensations, and trying to adjust to its caregiver ’ s needs, means the child
perceives that “something is wrong” with the way it is. Children who lack
physical attunement are vulnerable to shutting down the direct feedback
from their bodies, the seat of pleasure, purpose, and direction.
In the years since Bowlby’ s and W innicott’ s ideas were introduced,
attachment research around the world has shown that the vast majority of
children are securely attached. When they grow up, their history of reliable,

responsive caregiving will help to keep fear and anxiety at bay . Barring
exposure to some overwhelming life event—trauma—that breaks down the
self-regulatory system, they will maintain a fundamental state of emotional
security throughout their lives. Secure attachment also forms a template for
children’ s relationships. They pick up what others are feeling and early on
learn to tell a game from reality , and they develop a good nose for phony
situations or dangerous people. Securely attached children usually become
pleasant playmates and have lots of self-af firming experiences with their
peers. Having learned to be in tune with other people, they tend to notice
subtle changes in voices and faces and to adjust their behavior accordingly .
They learn to live within a shared understanding of the world and are likely
to become valued members of the community .
This upward spiral can, however , be reversed by abuse or neglect.
Abused kids are often very sensitive to changes in voices and faces, but
they tend to respond to them as threats rather than as cues for staying in
sync. Dr . Seth Pollak of the University of W isconsin showed a series of
faces to a group of normal eight-year -olds and compared their responses
with those of a group of abused children the same age. Looking at this
spectrum of angry to sad expressions, the abused kids were hyperalert to the
slightest features of anger .1 1

This is one reason abused children so easily become defensive or
scared. Imagine what it’ s like to make your way through a sea of faces in
the school corridor , trying to figure out who might assault you. Children
who overreact to their peers’ aggression, who don’ t pick up on other kids’
needs, who easily shut down or lose control of their impulses, are likely to
be shunned and left out of sleepovers or play dates. Eventually they may
learn to cover up their fear by putting up a tough front. Or they may spend
more and more time alone, watching TV or playing computer games, falling
even further behind on interpersonal skills and emotional self-regulation.

The need for attachment never lessens. Most human beings simply
cannot tolerate being disengaged from others for any length of time. People
who cannot connect through work, friendships, or family usually find other
ways of bonding, as through illnesses, lawsuits, or family feuds. Anything
is preferable to that godforsaken sense of irrelevance and alienation.
A few years ago, on Christmas Eve, I was called to examine a fourteen-
year -old boy at the Suf folk County Jail. Jack had been arrested for breaking
into the house of neighbors who were away on vacation. The bur glar alarm
was howling when the police found him in the living room.
The first question I asked Jack was who he expected would visit him in
jail on Christmas. “Nobody ,” he told me. “Nobody ever pays attention to
me.” It turned out that he had been caught during break-ins numerous times
before. He knew the police, and they knew him. W ith delight in his voice,
he told me that when the cops saw him standing in the middle of the living
room, they yelled, “Oh my God, it’ s Jack again, that little motherfucker .”
Somebody recognized him; somebody knew his name.  A little while later
Jack confessed, “Y ou know , that is what makes it worthwhile.” Kids will go
to almost any length to feel seen and connected.
LIVING WITH THE P ARENTS YOU HA VE
Children have a biological instinct to attach—they have no choice. Whether
their parents or caregivers are loving and caring or distant, insensitive,
rejecting, or abusive, children will develop a coping style based on their
attempt to get at least some of their needs met.
W e now have reliable ways to assess and identify these coping styles,
thanks lar gely to the work of two American scientists, Mary Ainsworth and
Mary Main, and their colleagues, who conducted thousands of hours of
observation of mother -infant pairs over many years. Based on these studies,
Ainsworth created a research tool called the Strange Situation, which looks
at how an infant reacts to temporary separation from the mother . Just as
Bowlby had observed, securely attached infants are distressed when their
mother leaves them, but they show delight when she returns, and after a
brief check-in for reassurance, they settle down and resume their play .

But with infants who are insecurely attached, the picture is more
complex. Children whose primary caregiver is unresponsive or rejecting
learn to deal with their anxiety in two distinct ways. The researchers noticed
that some seemed chronically upset and demanding with their mothers,
while others were more passive and withdrawn. In both groups contact with
the mothers failed to settle them down—they did not return to play
contentedly , as happens in secure attachment.
In one pattern, called “avoidant attachment,” the infants look like
nothing really bothers them—they don’ t cry when their mother goes away
and they ignore her when she comes back. However , this does not mean that
they are unaf fected. In fact, their chronically increased heart rates show that
they are in a constant state of hyperarousal. My colleagues and I call this
pattern “dealing but not feeling.”12 Most mothers of avoidant infants seem
to dislike touching their children. They have trouble snuggling and holding
them, and they don’ t use their facial expressions and voices to create
pleasurable back-and-forth rhythms with their babies.
In another pattern, called “anxious” or “ambivalent” attachment, the
infants constantly draw attention to themselves by crying, yelling, clinging,
or screaming: They are “feeling but not dealing.”13 They seem to have
concluded that unless they make a spectacle, nobody is going to pay
attention to them. They become enormously upset when they do not know
where their mother is but derive little comfort from her return. And even
though they don’ t seem to enjoy her company , they stay passively or angrily
focused on her , even in situations when other children would rather play .14
Attachment researchers think that the three “or ganized” attachment
strategies (secure, avoidant, and anxious) work because they elicit the best
care a particular caregiver is capable of providing. Infants who encounter a
consistent pattern of care—even if it’ s marked by emotional distance or
insensitivity—can adapt to maintain the relationship. That does not mean
that there are no problems: Attachment patterns often persist into adulthood.
Anxious toddlers tend to grow into anxious adults, while avoidant toddlers
are likely to become adults who are out of touch with their own feelings and
those of others. (As in, “There’ s nothing wrong with a good spanking. I got
hit and it made me the success I am today .”) In school avoidant children are
likely to bully other kids, while the anxious children are often their

victims.15 However , development is not linear , and many life experiences
can intervene to change these outcomes.
But there is another group that is less stably adapted, a group that
makes up the bulk of the children we treat and a substantial proportion of
the adults who are seen in psychiatric clinics. Some twenty years ago, Mary
Main and her colleagues at Berkeley began to identify a group of children
(about 15 percent of those they studied) who seemed to be unable to figure
out how to engage with their caregivers. The critical issue turned out to be
that the caregivers themselves were a source of distress or terror to the
children.16
Children in this situation have no one to turn to, and they are faced with
an unsolvable dilemma; their mothers are simultaneously necessary for
survival and a source of fear .17 They “can neither approach (the secure and
ambivalent ‘strategies’), shift [their] attention (the avoidant ‘strategy’), nor
flee.”18 If you observe such children in a nursery school or attachment
laboratory , you see them look toward their parents when they enter the
room and then quickly turn away . Unable to choose between seeking
closeness and avoiding the parent, they may rock on their hands and knees,
appear to go into a trance, freeze with their arms raised, or get up to greet
their parent and then fall to the ground. Not knowing who is safe or whom
they belong to, they may be intensely af fectionate with strangers or may
trust nobody . Main called this pattern “disor ganized attachment.”
Disor ganized attachment is “fright without solution.”19
BECOMING DISORGANIZED WITHIN
Conscientious parents often become alarmed when they discover
attachment research, worrying that their occasional impatience or their
ordinary lapses in attunement may permanently damage their kids. In real
life there are bound to be misunderstandings, inept responses, and failures
of communication. Because mothers and fathers miss cues or are simply
preoccupied with other matters, infants are frequently left to their own
devices to discover how they can calm themselves down. W ithin limits this
is not a problem. Kids need to learn to handle frustrations and
disappointments. W ith “good enough” caregivers, children learn that broken

connections can be repaired. The critical issue is whether they can
incorporate a feeling of being viscerally safe with their parents or other
caregivers.20
In a study of attachment patterns in over two thousand infants in
“normal” middle-class environments, 62 percent were found to be secure,
15 percent avoidant, 9 percent anxious (also known as ambivalent), and 15
percent disor ganized.21 Interestingly , this lar ge study showed that the
child’ s gender and basic temperament have little ef fect on attachment style;
for example, children with “dif ficult” temperaments are not more likely to
develop a disor ganized style. Kids from lower socioeconomic groups are
more likely to be disor ganized,22 with parents often severely stressed by
economic and family instability .
Children who don’ t feel safe in infancy have trouble regulating their
moods and emotional responses as they grow older . By kinder garten, many
disor ganized infants are either aggressive or spaced out and disengaged, and
they go on to develop a range of psychiatric problems.23 They also show
more physiological stress, as expressed in heart rate, heart rate variability ,24
stress hormone responses, and lowered immune factors.25 Does this kind of
biological dysregulation automatically reset to normal as a child matures or
is moved to a safe environment? So far as we know , it does not.
Parental abuse is not the only cause of disor ganized attachment: Parents
who are preoccupied with their own trauma, such as domestic abuse or rape
or the recent death of a parent or sibling, may also be too emotionally
unstable and inconsistent to of fer much comfort and protection.26 , 27 While
all parents need all the help they can get to help raise secure children,
traumatized parents, in particular , need help to be attuned to their children’ s
needs.
Caregivers often don’ t realize that they are out of tune. I vividly
remember a videotape Beatrice Beebe showed me.28 It featured a young
mother playing with her three-month-old infant. Everything was going well
until the baby pulled back and turned his head away , signaling that he
needed a break. But the mother did not pick up on his cue, and she
intensified her ef forts to engage him by bringing her face closer to his and
increasing the volume of her voice. When he recoiled even more, she kept
bouncing and poking him. Finally he started to scream, at which point the

mother put him down and walked away , looking crestfallen. She obviously
felt terrible, but she had simply missed the relevant cues. It’ s easy to
imagine how this kind of misattunement, repeated over and over again, can
gradually lead to a chronic disconnection. (Anyone who’ s raised a colicky
or hyperactive baby knows how quickly stress rises when nothing seems to
make a dif ference.) Chronically failing to calm her baby down and establish
an enjoyable face-to-face interaction, the mother is likely to come to
perceive him as a dif ficult child who makes her feel like a failure, and give
up on trying to comfort her child.
In practice it often is dif ficult to distinguish the problems that result
from disor ganized attachment from those that result from trauma: They are
often intertwined. My colleague Rachel Y ehuda studied rates of PTSD in
adult New Y orkers who had been assaulted or raped.29 Those whose
mothers were Holocaust survivors with PTSD had a significantly higher
rate of developing serious psychological problems after these traumatic
experiences. The most reasonable explanation is that their upbringing had
left them with a vulnerable physiology , making it dif ficult for them to
regain their equilibrium after being violated. Y ehuda found a similar
vulnerability in the children of pregnant women who were in the W orld
T rade Center that fatal day in 2001.30
Similarly , the reactions of children to painful events are lar gely
determined by how calm or stressed their parents are.  My former student
Glenn Saxe, now chairman of the Department of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry at NYU, showed that when children were hospitalized for
treatment of severe burns, the development of PTSD could be predicted by
how safe they felt with their mothers.31 The security of their attachment to
their mothers predicted the amount of morphine that was required to control
their pain—the more secure the attachment, the less painkiller was needed.
Another colleague, Claude Chemtob, who directs the Family T rauma
Research Program at NYU Langone Medical Center , studied 1 12 New Y ork
City children who had directly witnessed the terrorist attacks on 9/1 1.32
Children whose mothers were diagnosed with PTSD or depression during
follow-up were six times more likely to have significant emotional
problems and eleven times more likely to be hyperaggressive in response to
their experience. Children whose fathers had PTSD showed behavioral

problems as well, but Chemtob discovered that this ef fect was indirect and
was transmitted via the mother . (Living with an irascible, withdrawn, or
terrified spouse is likely to impose a major psychological burden on the
partner , including depression.)
If you have no internal sense of security , it is dif ficult to distinguish
between safety and danger . If you feel chronically numbed out, potentially
dangerous situations may make you feel alive. If you conclude that you
must be a terrible person (because why else would your parents have you
treated that way?), you start expecting other people to treat you horribly .
Y ou probably deserve it, and anyway , there is nothing you can do about it.
When disor ganized people carry self-perceptions like these, they are set up
to be traumatized by subsequent experiences.33
THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF DISORGANIZED
A TT ACHMENT
In the early 1980s my colleague Karlen L yons-Ruth, a Harvard attachment
researcher , began to videotape face-to-face interactions between mothers
and their infants at six months, twelve months and eighteen months. She
taped them again when the children were five years old and once more
when they were seven or eight.34 All were from high-risk families: 100
percent met federal poverty guidelines, and almost half the mothers were
single parents.
Disor ganized attachment showed up in two dif ferent ways: One group
of mothers seemed to be too preoccupied with their own issues to attend to
their infants. They were often intrusive and hostile; they alternated between
rejecting their infants and acting as if they expected them to respond to their
needs. Another group of mothers seemed helpless and fearful. They often
came across as sweet or fragile, but they didn’ t know how to be the adult in
the relationship and seemed to want their children to comfort them . They
failed to greet their children after having been away and did not pick them
up when the children were distressed. The mothers didn’ t seem to be doing
these things deliberately—they simply didn’ t know how to be attuned to
their kids and respond to their cues and thus failed to comfort and reassure
them. The hostile/intrusive mothers were more likely to have childhood

histories of physical abuse and/or of witnessing domestic violence, while
the withdrawn/dependent mothers were more likely to have histories of
sexual abuse or parental loss (but not physical abuse).35
I have always wondered how parents come to abuse their kids. After
all, raising healthy of fspring is at the very core of our human sense of
purpose and meaning. What could drive parents to deliberately hurt or
neglect their children? Karlen’ s research provided me with one answer:
W atching her videos, I could see the children becoming more and more
inconsolable, sullen, or resistant to their misattuned mothers. At the same
time, the mothers became increasingly frustrated, defeated, and helpless in
their interactions. Once the mother comes to see the child not as her partner
in an attuned relationship but as a frustrating, enraging, disconnected
stranger , the stage is set for subsequent abuse.
About eighteen years later , when these kids were around twenty years
old, L yons-Ruth did a follow-up study to see how they were coping. Infants
with seriously disrupted emotional communication patterns with their
mothers at eighteen months grew up to become young adults with an
unstable sense of self, self-damaging impulsivity (including excessive
spending, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, and binge
eating), inappropriate and intense anger , and recurrent suicidal behavior .
Karlen and her colleagues had expected that hostile/intrusive behavior
on the part of the mothers would be the most powerful predictor of mental
instability in their adult children, but they discovered otherwise. Emotional
withdrawal had the most profound and long-lasting impact. Emotional
distance and role reversal (in which mothers expected the kids to look after
them) were specifically linked to aggressive behavior against self and
others in the young adults.
DISSOCIA TION: KNOWING AND NOT KNOWING
L yons-Ruth was particularly interested in the phenomenon of dissociation,
which is manifested in feeling lost, overwhelmed, abandoned, and
disconnected from the world and in seeing oneself as unloved, empty ,
helpless, trapped, and weighed down. She found a “striking and
unexpected” relationship between maternal disengagement and

misattunement during the first two years of life and dissociative symptoms
in early adulthood. L yons-Ruth concludes that infants who are not truly
seen and known by their mothers are at high risk to grow into adolescents
who are unable to know and to see.”36
Infants who live in secure relationships learn to communicate not only
their frustrations and distress but also their emer ging selves—their interests,
preferences, and goals. Receiving a sympathetic response cushions infants
(and adults) against extreme levels of frightened arousal. But if your
caregivers ignore your needs, or resent your very existence, you learn to
anticipate rejection and withdrawal. Y ou cope as well as you can by
blocking out your mother ’ s hostility or neglect and act as if it doesn’ t
matter , but your body is likely to remain in a state of high alert, prepared to
ward of f blows, deprivation, or abandonment. Dissociation means
simultaneously knowing and not knowing.37
Bowlby wrote: “What cannot be communicated to the [m]other cannot
be communicated to the self.”38 If you cannot tolerate what you know or
feel what you feel, the only option is denial and dissociation.39 Maybe the
most devastating long-term ef fect of this shutdown is not feeling real inside,
a condition we saw in the kids in the Children’ s Clinic and that we see in
the children and adults who come to the T rauma Center . When you don’ t
feel real nothing matters, which makes it impossible to protect yourself
from danger . Or you may resort to extremes in an ef fort to feel something —
even cutting yourself with a razor blade or getting into fistfights with
strangers.
Karlen’ s research showed that dissociation is learned early: Later abuse
or other traumas did not account for dissociative symptoms in young
adults.40 Abuse and trauma accounted for many other problems, but not for
chronic dissociation or aggression against self. The critical underlying issue
was that these patients didn’ t know how to feel safe. Lack of safety within
the early caregiving relationship led to an impaired sense of inner reality ,
excessive clinging, and self-damaging behavior: Poverty , single parenthood,
or maternal psychiatric symptoms did not predict these symptoms.
This does not imply that child abuse is irrelevant41, but that the quality
of early caregiving is critically important in preventing mental health
problems, independent of other traumas.42 For that reason treatment needs

to address not only the imprints of specific traumatic events but also the
consequences of not having been mirrored, attuned to, and given consistent
care and af fection: dissociation and loss of self-regulation.
REST ORING SYNCHRONY
Early attachment patterns create the inner maps that chart our relationships
throughout life, not only in terms of what we expect from others, but also in
terms of how much comfort and pleasure we can experience in their
presence. I doubt that the poet e. e. cummings could have written his joyous
lines “i like my body when it is with your body . . . . muscles better and
nerves more” if his earliest experiences had been frozen faces and hostile
glances.43 Our relationship maps are implicit, etched into the emotional
brain and not reversible simply by understanding how they were created.
Y ou may realize that your fear of intimacy has something to do with your
mother ’ s postpartum depression or with the fact that she herself was
molested as a child, but that alone is unlikely to open you to happy , trusting
engagement with others.
However , that realization may help you to start exploring other ways to
connect in relationships—both for your own sake and in order to not pass
on an insecure attachment to your own children. In part 5 I’ll discuss a
number of approaches to healing damaged attunement systems through
training in rhythmicity and reciprocity .44 Being in synch with oneself and
with others requires the integration of our body-based senses—vision,
hearing, touch, and balance. If this did not happen in infancy and early
childhood, there is an increased chance of later sensory integration
problems (to which trauma and neglect are by no means the only pathways).
Being in synch means resonating through sounds and movements that
connect, which are embedded in the daily sensory rhythms of cooking and
cleaning, going to bed and waking up. Being in synch may mean sharing
funny faces and hugs, expressing delight or disapproval at the right
moments, tossing balls back and forth, or singing together . At the T rauma
Center , we have developed programs to coach parents in connection and
attunement, and my patients have told me about many other ways to get
themselves in synch, ranging from choral singing and ballroom dancing to

joining basketball teams, jazz bands and chamber music groups. All of
these foster a sense of attunement and communal pleasure.

The “night sea journey” is the journey into the parts of ourselves
that are split of f, disavowed, unknown, unwanted, cast out, and
exiled to the various subterranean worlds of consciousness. . . .
The goal of this journey is to reunite us with ourselves. Such a
homecoming can be surprisingly painful, even brutal. In order to
undertake it, we must first agree to exile nothing .
—Stephen Cope
arilyn was a tall, athletic-looking woman in her midthirties who
worked as an operating-room nurse in a nearby town. She told me
that a few months earlier she’d started to play tennis at her sports club with
a Boston fireman named Michael. She usually steered clear of men, she
said, but she had gradually become comfortable enough with Michael to
accept his invitations to go out for pizza after their matches. They’d talk
about tennis, movies, their nephews and nieces—nothing too personal.
Michael clearly enjoyed her company , but she told herself he didn’ t really
know her .
One Saturday evening in August, after tennis and pizza, she invited him
to stay over at her apartment. She described feeling “uptight and unreal” as
soon as they were alone together . She remembered asking him to go slow
but had very little sense of what had happened after that. After a few glasses

of wine and a rerun of Law & Or der , they apparently fell asleep together on
top of her bed. At around two in the morning, Michael turned over in his
sleep. When Marilyn felt his body touch hers, she exploded—pounding him
with her fists, scratching and biting, screaming, “Y ou bastard, you bastard!”
Michael, startled awake, grabbed his belongings and fled. After he left,
Marilyn sat on her bed for hours, stunned by what had happened. She felt
deeply humiliated and hated herself for what she had done, and now she’d
come to me for help in dealing with her terror of men and her inexplicable
rage attacks.
My work with veterans had prepared me to listen to painful stories like
Marilyn’ s without trying to jump in immediately to fix the problem.
Therapy often starts with some inexplicable behavior: attacking a boyfriend
in the middle of the night, feeling terrified when somebody looks you in the
eye, finding yourself covered with blood after cutting yourself with a piece
of glass, or deliberately vomiting up every meal. It takes time and patience
to allow the reality behind such symptoms to reveal itself.
TERROR AND NUMBNESS
As we talked, Marilyn told me that Michael was the first man she’d taken
home in more than five years, but this was not the first time she’d lost
control when a man spent the night with her . She repeated that she always
felt uptight and spaced out when she was alone with a man, and there had
been other times when she’d “come to” in her apartment, cowering in a
corner , unable to remember clearly what had happened.
Marilyn also said she felt as if she was just “going through the
motions” of having a life. Except for when she was at the club playing
tennis or at work in the operating room, she usually felt numb. A few years
earlier she’d found that she could relieve her numbness by scratching
herself with a razor blade, but she had become frightened when she found
that she was cutting herself more and more deeply , and more and more
often, to get relief. She had tried alcohol, too, but that reminded her of her
dad and his out-of-control drinking, which made her feel disgusted with
herself. So, instead, she played tennis fanatically , whenever she could. That
made her feel alive.

When I asked her about her past, Marilyn said she guessed that she
“must have had” a happy childhood, but she could remember very little
from before age twelve. She told me she’d been a timid adolescent, until
she had a violent confrontation with her alcoholic father when she was
sixteen and ran away from home. She worked her way through community
college and went on to get a degree in nursing without any help from her
parents. She felt ashamed that during this time she’d slept around, which
she described as “looking for love in all the wrong places.”
As I often did with new patients, I asked her to draw a family portrait,
and when I saw her drawing (reproduced above), I decided to go slowly .
Clearly Marilyn was harboring some terrible memories, but she could not
allow herself to recognize what her own picture revealed. She had drawn a
wild and terrified child, trapped in some kind of cage and threatened not
only by three nightmarish figures—one with no eyes—but also by a huge
erect penis protruding into her space. And yet this woman said she “must
have had” a happy childhood.
As the poet W . H. Auden wrote:

T ruth, like love and sleep, r esents
Appr oaches that ar e too intense.1
I call this Auden’ s rule, and in keeping with it I deliberately did not
push Marilyn to tell me what she remembered. In fact, I’ve learned that it’ s
not important for me to know every detail of a patient’ s trauma. What is
critical is that the patients themselves learn to tolerate feeling what they feel
and knowing what they know . This may take weeks or even years. I decided
to start Marilyn’ s treatment by inviting her to join an established therapy
group where she could find support and acceptance before facing the engine
of her distrust, shame, and rage.
As I expected, Marilyn arrived at the first group meeting looking
terrified, much like the girl in her family portrait; she was withdrawn and
did not reach out to anybody . I’d chosen this group for her because its
members had always been helpful and accepting of new members who were
too scared to talk. They knew from their own experience that unlocking
secrets is a gradual process. But this time they surprised me, asking so
many intrusive questions about Marilyn’ s love life that I recalled her
drawing of the little girl under assault. It was almost as though Marilyn had
unwittingly enlisted the group to repeat her traumatic past. I intervened to
help her set some boundaries about what she’d talk about, and she began to
settle in.
Three months later Marilyn told the group that she had stumbled and
fallen a few times on the sidewalk between the subway and my of fice. She
worried that her eyesight was beginning to fail: She’d also been missing a
lot of tennis balls recently . I thought again about her drawing and the wild
child with the huge, terrified eyes. W as this some sort of “conversion
reaction,” in which patients express their conflicts by losing function in
some part of their body? Many soldiers in both world wars had suf fered
paralysis that couldn’ t be traced to physical injuries, and I had seen cases of
“hysterical blindness” in Mexico and India
Still, as a physician, I wasn’ t about to conclude without further
assessment that this was “all in her head.” I referred her to colleagues at the
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and asked them to do a very thorough
workup. Several weeks later the tests came back. Marilyn had lupus

erythematosus of her retina, an autoimmune disease that was eroding her
vision, and she would need immediate treatment. I was appalled: Marilyn
was the third person that year whom I’d suspected of having an incest
history and who was then diagnosed with an autoimmune disease—a
disease in which the body starts attacking itself.
After making sure that Marilyn was getting the proper medical care, I
consulted with two of my colleagues at Massachusetts General, psychiatrist
Scott W ilson and Richard Kradin, who ran the immunology laboratory
there. I told them Marilyn’ s story , showed them the picture she’d drawn,
and asked them to collaborate on a study . They generously volunteered their
time and the considerable expense of a full immunology workup. W e
recruited twelve women with incest histories who were not taking any
medications, plus twelve women who had never been traumatized and who
also did not take meds—a surprisingly dif ficult control group to find.
(Marilyn was not in the study; we generally do not ask our clinical patients
to be part of our research ef forts.)
When the study was completed and the data analyzed, Rich reported
that the group of incest survivors had abnormalities in their CD45 RA-to-
RO ratio, compared with their nontraumatized peers. CD45 cells are the
“memory cells” of the immune system. Some of them, called RA cells, have
been activated by past exposure to toxins; they quickly respond to
environmental threats they have encountered before. The RO cells, in
contrast, are kept in reserve for new challenges; they are turned on to deal
with threats the body has not met previously . The RA-to-RO ratio is the
balance between cells that recognize known toxins and cells that wait for
new information to activate. In patients with histories of incest, the
proportion of RA cells that are ready to pounce is lar ger than normal. This
makes the immune system oversensitive to threat, so that it is prone to
mount a defense when none is needed, even when this means attacking the
body’ s own cells.
Our study showed that, on a deep level, the bodies of incest victims
have trouble distinguishing between danger and safety . This means that the
imprint of past trauma does not consist only of distorted perceptions of
information coming from the outside; the or ganism itself also has a problem
knowing how to feel safe. The past is impressed not only on their minds,
and in misinterpretations of innocuous events (as when Marilyn attacked

Michael because he accidentally touched her in her sleep), but also on the
very core of their beings: in the safety of their bodies.2
A T ORN MAP OF THE WORLD
How do people learn what is safe and what is not safe, what is inside and
what is outside, what should be resisted and what can safely be taken in?
The best way we can understand the impact of child abuse and neglect is to
listen to what people like Marilyn can teach us. One of the things that
became clear as I came to know her better was that she had her own unique
view of how the world functions.
As children, we start of f at the center of our own universe, where we
interpret everything that happens from an egocentric vantage point. If our
parents or grandparents keep telling us we’re the cutest, most delicious
thing in the world, we don’ t question their judgment—we must be exactly
that. And deep down, no matter what else we learn about ourselves, we will
carry that sense with us: that we are basically adorable. As a result, if we
later hook up with somebody who treats us badly , we will be outraged. It
won’ t feel right: It’ s not familiar; it’ s not like home. But if we are abused or
ignored in childhood, or grow up in a family where sexuality is treated with
disgust, our inner map contains a dif ferent message. Our sense of our self is
marked by contempt and humiliation, and we are more likely to think “he
(or she) has my number” and fail to protest if we are mistreated.
Marilyn’ s past shaped her view of every relationship. She was
convinced that men didn’ t give a damn about other people’ s feelings and
that they got away with whatever they wanted. W omen couldn’ t be trusted
either . They were too weak to stand up for themselves, and they’d sell their
bodies to get men to take care of them. If you were in trouble, they
wouldn’ t lift a finger to help you.  This worldview manifested itself in the
way Marilyn approached her colleagues at work: She was suspicious of the
motives of anyone who was kind to her and called them on the slightest
deviation from the nursing regulations. As for herself: She was a bad seed, a
fundamentally toxic person who made bad things happen to those around
her .

When I first encountered patients like Marilyn, I used to challenge their
thinking and try to help them see the world in a more positive, flexible way .
One day a woman named Kathy set me straight. A group member had
arrived late to a session because her car had broken down, and Kathy
immediately blamed herself: “I saw how rickety your car was last week; I
knew I should have of fered you a ride.” Her self-criticism escalated to the
point that, only a few minutes later , she was taking responsibility for her
sexual abuse: “I brought it on myself: I was seven years old and I loved my
daddy . I wanted him to love me, and I did what he wanted me to do. It was
my own fault.” When I intervened to reassure her , saying, “Come on, you
were just a little girl—it was your father ’ s responsibility to maintain the
boundaries,” Kathy turned toward me. “Y ou know , Bessel,” she said, “I
know how important it is for you to be a good therapist, so when you make
stupid comments like that, I usually thank you profusely . After all, I am an
incest survivor—I was trained to take care of the needs of grown-up,
insecure men. But after two years I trust you enough to tell you that those
comments make me feel terrible. Y es, it’ s true; I instinctively blame myself
for everything bad that happens to the people around me. I know that isn’ t
rational, and I feel really dumb for feeling this way , but I do. When you try
to talk me into being more reasonable I only feel even more lonely and
isolated—and it confirms the feeling that nobody in the whole world will
ever understand what it feels like to be me.”
I genuinely thanked her for her feedback, and I’ve tried ever since not
to tell my patients that they should not feel the way they do. Kathy taught
me that my responsibility goes much deeper: I have to help them
reconstruct their inner map of the world.
As I discussed in the previous chapter , attachment researchers have
shown that our earliest caregivers don’ t only feed us, dress us, and comfort
us when we are upset; they shape the way our rapidly growing brain
perceives reality . Our interactions with our caregivers convey what is safe
and what is dangerous: whom we can count on and who will let us down;
what we need to do to get our needs met. This information is embodied in
the warp and woof of our brain circuitry and forms the template of how we
think of ourselves and the world around us. These inner maps are
remarkably stable across time.

This doesn’ t mean, however , that our maps can’ t be modified by
experience. A deep love relationship, particularly during adolescence, when
the brain once again goes through a period of exponential change, truly can
transform us. So can the birth of a child, as our babies often teach us how to
love. Adults who were abused or neglected as children can still learn the
beauty of intimacy and mutual trust or have a deep spiritual experience that
opens them to a lar ger universe. In contrast, previously uncontaminated
childhood maps can become so distorted by an adult rape or assault that all
roads are rerouted into terror or despair . These responses are not reasonable
and therefore cannot be changed simply by reframing irrational beliefs. Our
maps of the world are encoded in the emotional brain, and changing them
means having to reor ganize that part of the central nervous system, the
subject of the treatment section of this book.
Nonetheless, learning to recognize irrational thoughts and behavior can
be a useful first step. People like Marilyn often discover that their
assumptions are not the same as those of their friends. If they are lucky ,
their friends and colleagues will tell them in words, rather than in actions,
that their distrust and self-hatred makes collaboration dif ficult. But that
rarely happens, and Marilyn’ s experience was typical: After she assaulted
Michael, he had absolutely no interest in working things out, and she lost
both his friendship and her favorite tennis partner . It is at this point that
smart and courageous people like Marilyn, who maintain their curiosity and
determination in the face of repeated defeats, start looking for help.
Generally the rational brain can override the emotional brain, as long as
our fears don’ t hijack us. (For example, your fear at being flagged down by
the police can turn instantly to gratitude when the cop warns you that
there’ s an accident ahead.) But the moment we feel trapped, enraged, or
rejected, we are vulnerable to activating old maps and to follow their
directions. Change begins when we learn to “own” our emotional brains.
That means learning to observe and tolerate the heartbreaking and gut-
wrenching  sensations that register misery and humiliation. Only after
learning to bear what is going on inside can we start to befriend, rather than
obliterate, the emotions that keep our maps fixed and immutable.
LEARNING T O REMEMBER

About a year into Marilyn’ s group, another member , Mary , asked
permission to talk about what had happened to her when she was thirteen
years old. Mary worked as a prison guard, and she was involved in a
sadomasochistic relationship with another woman. She wanted the group to
know her background in the hope that they would become more tolerant of
her extreme reactions, such as her tendency to shut down or blow up in
response to the slightest provocation.
Struggling to get the words out, Mary told us that one evening, when
she was thirteen years old, she was raped by her older brother and a gang of
his friends. The rape resulted in pregnancy , and her mother gave her an
abortion at home, on the kitchen table. The group sensitively tuned in to
what Mary was sharing and comforted her through her sobbing. I was
profoundly moved by their empathy—they were consoling Mary in a way
that they must have wished somebody had comforted them when they first
confronted their traumas.
When time ran out, Marilyn asked if she could take a few more minutes
to talk about what she had experienced during the session. The group
agreed, and she told us: “Hearing that story , I wonder if I may have been
sexually abused myself.” My mouth must have dropped open. Based on her
family drawing, I had always assumed that she was aware, at least on some
level, that this was the case. She had reacted like an incest victim in her
response to Michael, and she chronically behaved as if the world were a
terrifying place.
Y et even though she’d drawn a girl who was being sexually molested,
she—or at least her cognitive, verbal self—had no idea what had actually
happened to her . Her immune system, her muscles, and her fear system all
had kept the score, but her conscious mind lacked a story that could
communicate the experience. She reenacted her trauma in her life, but she
had no narrative to refer to. As we will see in chapter 12, traumatic memory
dif fers in complex ways from normal recall, and it involves many layers of
mind and brain.
T riggered by Mary’ s story , and spurred on by the nightmares that
followed, Marilyn began individual therapy with me in which she started to
deal with her past. At first she experienced waves of intense, free-floating
terror . She tried stopping for several weeks, but when she found she could
no longer sleep and had to take time of f from work, she continued our

sessions. As she told me later: “My only criterion for whether a situation is
harmful is feeling, ‘This is going to kill me if I don’ t get out.’”
I began to teach Marilyn calming techniques, such as focusing on
breathing deeply—in and out, in and out, at six breaths a minute—while
following the sensations of the breath in her body . This was combined with
tapping acupressure points, which helped her not to become overwhelmed.
W e also worked on mindfulness: Learning to keep her mind alive while
allowing her body to feel the feelings that she had come to dread slowly
enabled Marilyn to stand back and observe her experience, rather than
being immediately hijacked by her feelings. She had tried to dampen or
abolish those feelings with alcohol and exercise, but now she began to feel
safe enough to begin to remember what had happened to her as a girl. As
she gained ownership over her physical sensations, she also began to be
able to tell the dif ference between past and present: Now if she felt
someone’ s leg brush against her in the night, she might be able to recognize
it as Michael’ s leg, the leg of the handsome tennis partner she’d invited to
her apartment. That leg did not belong to anyone else, and its touch didn’ t
mean someone was trying to molest her . Being still enabled her to know—
fully , physically know—that she was a thirty-four -year -old woman and not
a little girl.
When Marilyn finally began to access her memories, they emer ged as
flashbacks of the wallpaper in her childhood bedroom. She realized that this
was what she had focused on when her father raped her when she was eight
years old. His molestation had scared her beyond her capacity to endure, so
she had needed to push it out of her memory bank. After all, she had to
keep living with this man, her father , who had assaulted her . Marilyn
remembered having turned to her mother for protection, but when she ran to
her and tried to hide herself by burying her face in her mother ’ s skirt, she
was met with only a limp embrace. At times her mother remained silent; at
others she cried or angrily scolded Marilyn for “making Daddy so angry .”
The terrified child found no one to protect her , to of fer strength or shelter .
As Roland Summit wrote in his classic study The Child Sexual Abuse
Accommodation Syndr ome : “Initiation, intimidation, stigmatization,
isolation, helplessness and self-blame depend on a terrifying reality of child
sexual abuse. Any attempts by the child to divulge the secret will be
countered by an adult conspiracy of silence and disbelief. ‘Don’ t worry

about things like that; that could never happen in our family .’ ‘How could
you ever think of such a terrible thing?’ ‘Don’ t let me ever hear you say
anything like that again!’ The average child never asks and never tells.”3
After forty years of doing this work I still regularly hear myself saying,
“That’ s unbelievable,” when patients tell me about their childhoods. They
often are as incredulous as I am—how could parents inflict such torture and
terror on their own child? Part of them continues to insist that they must
have made the experience up or that they are exaggerating. All of them are
ashamed about what happened to them, and they blame themselves—on
some level they firmly believe that these terrible things were done to them
because they are terrible people.
Marilyn now began to explore how the powerless child had learned to
shut down and comply with whatever was asked of her . She had done so by
making herself disappear: The moment she heard her father ’ s footsteps in
the corridor outside her bedroom, she would “put her head in the clouds.”
Another patient of mine who had a similar experience made a drawing that
depicts how that process works. When her father started to touch her , she
made herself disappear; she floated up to the ceiling, looking down on some
other little girl in the bed.4 She was glad that it was not really her—it was
some other girl who was being molested.

Looking at these heads separated from their bodies by an impenetrable
fog really opened my eyes to the experience of dissociation, which is so
common among incest victims. Marilyn herself later realized that, as an
adult, she had continued to float up to the ceiling when she found herself in
a sexual situation. In the period when she’d been more sexually active, a
partner would occasionally tell her how amazing she’d been in bed—that
he’d barely recognized her , that she’d even talked dif ferently . Usually she
did not remember what had happened, but at other times she’d become
angry and aggressive. She had no sense of who she really was sexually , so
she gradually withdrew from dating altogether—until Michael.
HA TING YOUR HOME
Children have no choice who their parents are, nor can they understand that
parents may simply be too depressed, enraged, or spaced out to be there for
them or that their parents’ behavior may have little to do with them.
Children have no choice but to or ganize themselves to survive within the
families they have. Unlike adults, they have no other authorities to turn to

for help—their parents ar e  the authorities. They cannot rent an apartment or
move in with someone else: Their very survival hinges on their caregivers.
Children sense—even if it they are not explicitly threatened—that if
they talked about their beatings or molestation to teachers they would be
punished. Instead, they focus their ener gy on not  thinking about what has
happened and not feeling the residues of terror and panic in their bodies.
Because they cannot tolerate knowing what they have experienced, they
also cannot understand that their anger , terror , or collapse has anything to
do with that experience. They don’ t talk; they act and deal with their
feelings by being enraged, shut down, compliant, or defiant.
Children are also programmed to be fundamentally loyal to their
caretakers, even if they are abused by them. T error increases the need for
attachment, even if the source of comfort is also the source of terror . I have
never met a child below the age of ten who was tortured at home (and who
had broken bones and burned skin to show for it) who, if given the option,
would not have chosen to stay with his or her family rather than being
placed in a foster home. Of course, clinging to one’ s abuser is not exclusive
to childhood. Hostages have put up bail for their captors, expressed a wish
to marry them, or had sexual relations with them; victims of domestic
violence often cover up for their abusers. Judges often tell me how
humiliated they feel when they try to protect victims of domestic violence
by issuing restraining orders, only to find out that many of them secretly
allow their partners to return.
It took Marilyn a long time before she was ready to talk about her
abuse: She was not ready to violate her loyalty to her family—deep inside
she felt that she still needed them to protect her against her fears. The price
of this loyalty is unbearable feelings of loneliness, despair , and the
inevitable rage of helplessness. Rage that has nowhere to go is redirected
against the self, in the form of depression, self-hatred, and self-destructive
actions. One of my patients told me, “It is like hating your home, your
kitchen and pots and pans, your bed, your chairs, your table, your rugs.”
Nothing feels safe—least of all your own body .
Learning to trust is a major challenge. One of my other patients, a
schoolteacher whose grandfather raped her repeatedly before she was six,
sent me the following e-mail: “I started mulling the danger of opening up
with you in traf fic  on the way home after our therapy appointment, and

then, as I mer ged into Route 124, I realized that I had broken the rule of not
getting attached, to you and to my students.”
During our next meeting she told me she had also been raped by her lab
instructor in college. I asked her whether she had sought help and made a
complaint against him. “I couldn’ t make myself cross the road to the
clinic,” she replied. “I was desperate for help, but as I stood there, I felt
very deeply that I would only be hurt even more. And that might well have
been true. Of course, I had to hide what had happened from my parents—
and from everyone else.”
After I told her that I was concerned about what was going on with her ,
she wrote me another e-mail: “I’m trying to remind myself that I didn’ t do
anything to deserve such treatment. I don’ t think I have ever had anyone
look at me like that and say they were worried about me, and I am holding
on to it like a treasure: the idea that I am worth being worried about by
someone I respect and who does understand how deeply I am struggling
now .”
In order to know who we are—to have an identity—we must know (or
at least feel that we know) what is and what was “real.” W e must observe
what we see around us and label it correctly; we must also be able trust our
memories and be able to tell them apart from our imagination. Losing the
ability to make these distinctions is one sign of what psychoanalyst W illiam
Niederland called “soul murder .” Erasing awareness and cultivating denial
are often essential to survival, but the price is that you lose track of who
you are, of what you are feeling, and of what and whom you can trust.5
REPLA YING THE TRAUMA
One memory of Marilyn’ s childhood trauma came to her in a dream in
which she felt as if she were being choked and was unable to breathe. A
white tea towel was wrapped around her hands, and then she was lifted up
with the towel around her neck, so that she could not touch the ground with
her feet. She woke in a panic, thinking that she was surely going to die. Her
dream reminded me of the nightmares war veterans had reported to me:
seeing the precise, unadulterated images of faces and body parts they had
encountered in battle. These dreams were so terrifying that they tried to not

fall asleep at night; only daytime napping, which was not associated with
nocturnal ambushes, felt halfway safe.
During this stage of therapy Marilyn was repeatedly flooded with
images and sensations related to the choking dream. She remembered
sitting in the kitchen as a four -year -old with swollen eyes, a sore neck, and
a bloody nose, while her father and brother laughed at her and called her a
stupid, stupid girl. One day Marilyn reported, “As I was brushing my teeth
last evening, I was overcome with feelings of thrashing around. I was like a
fish out of water , violently turning my body as I fought against the lack of
air . I sobbed and choked as I brushed my teeth. Panic was rising up out of
my chest with the feeling of thrashing. I had to use every bit of strength I
had not to scream, ‘NONONONONONO,’ as I stood over the sink.” She
went to bed and fell asleep but woke up like clockwork every two hours
during the rest of the night.
T rauma is not stored as a narrative with an orderly beginning, middle,
and end. As I’ll discuss in detail in chapters 1 1 and 12, memories initially
return as they did for Marilyn: as flashbacks that contain fragments of the
experience, isolated images, sounds, and body sensations that initially have
no context other than fear and panic. When Marilyn was a child, she had no
way of giving voice to the unspeakable, and it would have made no
dif ference anyway—nobody was listening.
Like so many survivors of  childhood abuse, Marilyn exemplified the
power of the life force, the will to live and to own one’ s life, the ener gy that
counteracts the annihilation of trauma. I gradually came to realize that the
only thing that makes it possible to do the work of healing trauma is awe at
the dedication to survival that enabled my patients to endure their abuse and
then to endure the dark nights of the soul that inevitably occur on the road
to recovery .

—Roland Summit The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome
ow do we or ganize our thinking with regard to individuals like
Marilyn, Mary , and Kathy , and what can we do to help them? The way
we define their problems, our diagnosis, will determine how we approach
their care. Such patients typically receive five or six dif ferent unrelated
diagnoses in the course of their psychiatric treatment. If their doctors focus
on their mood swings, they will be identified as bipolar and prescribed
lithium or valproate.  If the professionals are most impressed with their
despair , they will be told they are suf fering from major depression and
given antidepressants. If the doctors focus on their restlessness and lack of
attention, they may be categorized as ADHD and treated with Ritalin or
other stimulants. And if the clinic staf f happens to take a trauma history ,
and the patient actually volunteers the relevant information, he or she might
receive the diagnosis of PTSD. None of these diagnoses will be completely

of f the mark, and none of them will begin to meaningfully describe who
these patients are and what they suf fer from.
Psychiatry , as a subspecialty of medicine, aspires to define mental
illness as precisely as, let’ s say , cancer of the pancreas, or streptococcal
infection of the lungs. However , given the complexity of mind, brain, and
human attachment systems, we have not come even close to achieving that
sort of precision. Understanding what is “wrong” with people currently is
more a question of the mind-set of the practitioner (and of what insurance
companies will pay for) than of verifiable, objective facts.
The first serious attempt to create a systematic manual of psychiatric
diagnoses occurred in 1980, with the release of the third edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor ders,  the of ficial list of
all mental diseases recognized by the American Psychiatric Association
(AP A). The preamble to the DSM-III warned explicitly that its categories
were insuf ficiently precise to be used in forensic settings or for insurance
purposes. Nonetheless it gradually became an instrument of enormous
power: Insurance companies require a DSM diagnosis for reimbursement,
until recently all research funding was based on DSM diagnoses, and
academic programs are or ganized around DSM categories. DSM labels
quickly found their way into the lar ger culture as well. Millions of people
know that T ony Soprano suf fered from panic attacks and depression and
that Carrie Mathison of Homeland  struggles with bipolar disorder . The
manual has become a virtual industry that has earned the American
Psychiatric Association well over $100 million.1 The question is: Has it
provided comparable benefits for the patients it is meant to serve?
A psychiatric diagnosis has serious consequences: Diagnosis informs
treatment, and getting the wrong treatment can have disastrous ef fects.
Also, a diagnostic label is likely to attach to people for the rest of their lives
and have a profound influence on how they define themselves. I have met
countless patients who told me that they “are” bipolar or borderline or that
they “have” PTSD, as if they had been sentenced to remain in an
under ground dungeon for the rest of their lives, like the Count of Monte
Cristo.
None of these diagnoses takes into account the unusual talents that
many of our patients develop or the creative ener gies they have mustered to

survive. All too often diagnoses are mere tallies  of  symptoms, leaving
patients such as Marilyn, Kathy , and Mary likely to be viewed as  out-of-
control women who need to be straightened out.
The dictionary defines diagnosis as “ a. The act or process of
identifying or determining the nature and cause of a disease or injury
through evaluation of patient history , examination, and review of laboratory
data. b. The opinion derived from such an evaluation.”2 In this chapter , and
the next, I will discuss the chasm between of ficial diagnoses and what our
patients actually suf fer from and discuss how my colleagues and I have
tried to change the way patients with chronic trauma histories are
diagnosed.
HOW DO YOU T AKE A TRAUMA HIST OR Y?
In 1985 I started to collaborate with psychiatrist Judith Herman, whose first
book, Father -Daughter Incest , had recently been published. W e were both
working at Cambridge Hospital (one of Harvard’ s teaching hospitals) and,
sharing an interest in how trauma had af fected the lives of our patients, we
began to meet regularly and compare notes. W e were struck by how many
of our patients who were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder
(BPD) told us horror stories about their childhoods. BPD is marked by
clinging but highly unstable relationships, extreme mood swings, and self-
destructive behavior , including self-mutilation and repeated suicide
attempts. In order to uncover whether there was, in fact, a relationship
between childhood trauma and BPD, we designed a formal scientific study
and sent of f a grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health. It was
rejected.
Undeterred, Judy and I decided to finance the study ourselves, and we
found an ally in Chris Perry , the director of research at Cambridge Hospital,
who was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health to study BPD
and other near neighbor diagnoses, so called personality disorders, in
patients recruited from the Cambridge Hospital. He had collected volumes
of valuable data on these subjects but had never inquired about childhood
abuse and neglect. Even though he did not hide his skepticism about our
proposal, he was very generous to us and arranged for us to interview fifty-

five patients from the hospital’ s outpatient department, and he agreed to
compare our findings with records in the lar ge database he had already
collected.
The first question Judy and I faced was: How do you take a trauma
history? Y ou can’ t ask a patient point blank: “W ere you molested as a kid?”
or “Did your father beat you up?” How many would trust a complete
stranger with such delicate information? Keeping in mind that people
universally feel ashamed about the traumas they have experienced, we
designed an interview instrument, the T raumatic Antecedents Questionnaire
(T AQ).3 The interview started with a series of simple questions: “Where do
you live, and who do you live with?”; “Who pays the bills and who does the
cooking and cleaning?” It progressed gradually to more revealing questions:
“Who do you rely on in your daily life?” As in: When you’re sick, who
does the shopping or takes you to the doctor? “Who do you talk to when
you are upset?” In other words, who provides you with emotional and
practical support? Some patients gave us surprising answers: “my dog” or
“my therapist”—or “nobody .”
W e then asked similar questions about their childhood: Who lived in
the household? How often did you move? Who was your primary
caretaker? Many of the patients reported frequent relocations that required
them to change schools in the middle of the year . Several had primary
caregivers who had gone to jail, been placed in a mental hospital, or joined
the military . Others had moved from foster home to foster home or had
lived with a string of dif ferent relatives.
The next section of the questionnaire addressed childhood
relationships: “Who in your family was af fectionate to you?” “Who treated
you as a special person?” This was followed by a critical question—one
that, to my knowledge, had never before been asked in a scientific study:
“W as there anybody who you felt safe with growing up?” One out of four
patients we interviewed could not recall anyone they had felt safe with as a
child. W e checked “nobody” on our work sheets and did not comment, but
we were stunned. Imagine  being a child  and not having a source of safety ,
making your way into the world unprotected and unseen.
The questions continued: “Who made the rules at home and enforced
the discipline?” “How were kids kept in line—by talking, scolding,

spanking, hitting, locking you up?” “How did your parents solve their
disagreements?” By then the floodgates had usually opened, and many
patients were volunteering detailed information about their childhoods. One
woman had witnessed her little sister being raped; another told us she’d had
her first sexual experience at age eight—with her grandfather . Men and
women reported lying awake at night listening to furniture crashing and
parents screaming; a young man had come down to the kitchen and found
his mother lying in a pool of blood. Others talked about not being picked up
at elementary school or coming home to find an empty house and spending
the night alone. One woman who made her living as a cook had learned to
prepare meals for her family after her mother was jailed on a drug
conviction. Another had been nine when she grabbed and steadied the car ’ s
steering wheel because her drunken mother was swerving down a four -lane
highway during rush hour .
Our patients did not have the option to run away or escape; they had
nobody to turn to and no place to hide. Y et they somehow had to manage
their terror and despair .  They probably went to school the next morning and
tried to pretend that everything was fine. Judy and I realized that the BPD
group’ s problems—dissociation, desperate clinging to whomever might be
enlisted to help—had probably started of f as ways of dealing with
overwhelming emotions and inescapable brutality .
After our interviews Judy and I met to code our patients’ answers—that
is, to translate them into numbers for computer analysis, and Chris Perry
then collated them with the extensive information on these patients he had
stored on Harvard’ s mainframe computer . One Saturday morning in April
he left us a message asking us to come to his of fice. There we found a huge
stack of printouts, on top of which Chris had placed a Gary Larson cartoon
of a group of scientists studying dolphins and being puzzled by “those
strange ‘aw blah es span yol’ sounds.” The data had convinced him that
unless you understand the language of trauma and abuse, you cannot really
understand BPD.
As we later reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry , 81 percent
of the patients diagnosed with BPD at Cambridge Hospital reported severe
histories of child abuse and/or neglect; in the vast majority the abuse began
before age seven.4 This finding was particularly important because it

suggested that the impact of abuse depends, at least in part, on the age at
which it begins. Later research by Martin T eicher at McLean Hospital
showed that dif ferent forms of abuse have dif ferent impacts on various
brain areas at dif ferent stages of development.5 Although numerous studies
have since replicated our findings,6 I still regularly get scientific papers to
review that say things like “It has been hypothesized that borderline patients
may have histories of childhood trauma.” When does a hypothesis become
a scientifically established fact?
Our study clearly supported  the conclusions of John Bowlby .
When children feel pervasively angry or guilty or are chronically
frightened about being abandoned, they have come by such
feelings honestly; that is because of experience. When, for
example, children fear abandonment, it is not in counterreaction to
their intrinsic homicidal ur ges; rather , it is more likely because
they have been abandoned physically or psychologically , or have
been repeatedly threatened with abandonment. When children are
pervasively filled with rage, it is due to rejection or harsh
treatment. When children experience intense inner conflict
regarding their angry feelings, this is likely because expressing
them may be forbidden or even dangerous.
Bowlby noticed that when children must disown powerful experiences they
have had, this creates serious problems, including “chronic distrust of other
people, inhibition of curiosity , distrust of their own senses, and the tendency
to find everything unreal.”7 As we will see, this has important implications
for treatment.
Our study expanded our thinking beyond the impact of particular
horrendous events, the focus of the PTSD diagnosis, to look at the long-
term ef fects of brutalization and neglect in caregiving relationships. It also
raised another critical question: What therapies are ef fective for people with
a history of abuse, particularly those who feel chronically suicidal and
deliberately hurt themselves ?

SELF-HARM
During my training I was called from my bed at around 3:00 a.m. three
nights in a row to stitch up a woman who had slashed her neck with
whatever sharp object she could lay her hands on. She told me, somewhat
triumphantly , that  cutting herself made her feel much better . Ever since then
I’d asked myself why . Why do some people deal with being upset by
playing three sets of tennis or drinking a stif f martini, while others carve
their arms with razor blades? Our study showed that having a history of
childhood sexual and physical abuse was a strong predictor of repeated
suicide attempts and self-cutting.8 I wondered if their suicidal ruminations
had started when they were very young and whether they had found
comfort in plotting their escape by hoping to die or doing damage to
themselves. Does inflicting harm on oneself begin as a desperate attempt to
gain some sense of control?
Chris Perry’ s database had follow-up information on all the patients
who were treated in the hospital’ s outpatient clinics, including reports on
suicidality and self-destructive behavior . After three years of therapy
approximately two-thirds of the patients had markedly improved. Now the
question was, which members of the group had benefited from therapy and
which had continued to feel suicidal and self-destructive? Comparing the
patients’ ongoing behavior with our T AQ interviews provided some
answers. The patients who remained self-destructive had told us that they
did not remember feeling safe with anybody as a child; they had reported
being abandoned, shuttled from place to place, and generally left to their
own devices.
I concluded that, if you carry a memory of having felt safe with
somebody long ago, the traces of that earlier af fection can be reactivated in
attuned relationships when you are an adult, whether these occur in daily
life or in good therapy . However , if you lack a deep memory of feeling
loved and safe, the receptors in the brain that respond to human kindness
may simply fail to develop.9 If that is the case, how can people learn to
calm themselves down and feel grounded in their bodies? Again, this has
important implications for therapy , and I’ll return to this question
throughout part 5, on treatment.

THE POWER OF DIAGNOSIS
Our study also confirmed that there was a traumatized population quite
distinct from the combat soldiers and accident victims for whom the PTSD
diagnosis had been created. People like Marilyn and Kathy , as well as the
patients Judy and I had studied, and the kids in the outpatient clinic at
MMHC that I described in chapter 7, do not necessarily remember their
traumas (one of the criteria for the PTSD diagnosis) or at least are not
preoccupied with specific memories of their abuse, but they continue to
behave as if they were still in danger . They go from one extreme to the
other; they have trouble staying on task, and they continually lash out
against themselves and others. T o some degree their problems do overlap
with those of combat soldiers, but they are also very dif ferent in that their
childhood trauma has prevented them from developing some of the mental
capacities that adult soldiers possessed before their traumas occurred.
After we realized this, a group of us10 went to see Robert Spitzer , who,
after having guided the development of the DSM-III,  was in the process of
revising the manual. He listened carefully to what we told him. He told us it
was likely that clinicians who spend their days treating a particular patient
population are likely to develop considerable expertise in understanding
what ails them. He suggested that we do a study , a so-called field trial, to
compare the problems of dif ferent groups of traumatized individuals.1 1
Spitzer put me in char ge of the project. First we developed a rating scale
that incorporated all the dif ferent trauma symptoms that had been reported
in the scientific literature, then we interviewed 525 adult patients at five
sites around the country to see if particular populations suf fered from
dif ferent constellations of problems. Our populations fell into three groups:
those with histories of childhood physical or sexual abuse by caregivers;
recent victims of domestic violence; and people who had recently been
through a natural disaster .
There were clear dif ferences among these groups, particularly those on
the extreme ends of the spectrum: victims of child abuse and adults who
had survived natural disasters. The adults who had been abused as children
often had trouble concentrating, complained of always being on edge, and
were filled with self-loathing. They had enormous trouble negotiating
intimate relationships, often veering from indiscriminate, high-risk, and

unsatisfying sexual involvements to total sexual shutdown. They also had
lar ge gaps in their memories, often engaged in self-destructive behaviors,
and had a host of medical problems. These symptoms were relatively rare in
the survivors of natural disasters.
Each major diagnosis in the DSM had a workgroup responsible for
suggesting revisions for the new edition. I presented the results of the field
trial to our DSM-IV  PTSD work group, and we voted nineteen to two to
create a new trauma diagnosis for victims of interpersonal trauma:
“Disorders of Extreme Stress, Not Otherwise Specified” (DESNOS), or
“Complex PTSD” for short.12 , 13 W e then eagerly anticipated the publication
of the DSM-IV  in May 1994. But much to our surprise the diagnosis that our
work group had overwhelmingly approved did not appear in the final
product. None of us had been consulted.
This was a tragic exclusion. It meant that lar ge numbers of patients
could not be accurately diagnosed and that clinicians and researchers would
be unable to scientifically develop appropriate treatments for them. Y ou
cannot develop a treatment for a condition that does not exist. Not having a
diagnosis now confronts therapists with a serious dilemma: How do we
treat people who are coping with the fall-out of abuse, betrayal and
abandonment when we are forced  to diagnose them with depression, panic
disorder , bipolar illness, or borderline personality , which do not really
address what they are coping with?
The consequences of caretaker abuse and neglect are vastly more
common and complex than the impact of hurricanes or motor vehicle
accidents. Y et the decision makers who determined the shape of our
diagnostic system decided not to recognize this evidence. T o this day , after
twenty years and four subsequent revisions, the DSM and the entire system
based on it fail victims of child abuse and neglect—just as they ignored the
plight of veterans before PTSD was introduced back in 1980.
THE HIDDEN EPIDEMIC
How do you turn a newborn baby with all its promise and infinite capacities
into a thirty-year -old homeless drunk? As with so many great discoveries,

internist V incent Felitti came across the answer to this question
accidentally .
In 1985 Felitti was chief of Kaiser Permanente’ s Department of
Preventive Medicine in San Diego, which at the time was the lar gest
medical screening program in the world. He was also running an obesity
clinic that used a technique called “supplemented absolute fasting” to bring
about dramatic weight loss without sur gery . One day a twenty-eight-year -
old nurse’ s aide showed up in his of fice. Felitti accepted her claim that
obesity was her principal problem and enrolled her in the program. Over the
next fifty-one weeks her weight dropped from 408 pounds to 132 pounds.
However , when Felitti next saw her a few months later , she had
regained more weight than he thought was biologically possible in such a
short time. What had happened? It turned out that her newly svelte body
had attracted a male coworker , who started to flirt with her and then
suggested sex. She went home and began to eat. She stuf fed herself during
the day and ate while sleepwalking at night. When Felitti probed this
extreme reaction, she revealed a lengthy incest history with her grandfather .
This was only the second case of incest Felitti had encountered in his
twenty-three-year medical practice, and yet about ten days later he heard a
similar story . As he and his team started to inquire more closely , they were
shocked to discover that most of their morbidly obese patients had been
sexually abused as children. They also uncovered a host of other family
problems.
In 1990 Felitti went to Atlanta to present data from the team’ s first 286
patient interviews at a meeting of the North American Association for the
Study of Obesity . He was stunned by the harsh response of some experts:
Why did he believe such patients? Didn’ t he realize they would fabricate
any explanation for their failed lives? However , an epidemiologist from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encouraged Felitti to
start a much lar ger study , drawing on a general population, and invited him
to meet with a small group of researchers at the CDC. The result was the
monumental investigation of Adverse Childhood Experiences (now know at
the ACE study), a collaboration between the CDC and Kaiser Permanente,
with Robert Anda, MD, and V incent Felitti, MD, as co–principal
investigators.

More than fifty thousand Kaiser patients came through the Department
of Preventive Medicine annually for a comprehensive evaluation, filling out
an extensive medical questionnaire in the process. Felitti and Anda spent
more than a year developing ten new questions14 covering carefully defined
categories of adverse childhood experiences, including physical and sexual
abuse, physical and emotional neglect, and family dysfunction, such as
having had parents who were divorced, mentally ill, addicted, or in prison.
They then asked 25,000 consecutive patients if they would be willing to
provide information about childhood events; 17,421 said yes. Their
responses were then compared with the detailed medical records that Kaiser
kept on all patients.
The ACE study revealed that traumatic life experiences during
childhood and adolescence are far more common than expected. The study
respondents were mostly white, middle class, middle aged, well educated,
and financially secure enough to have good medical insurance, and yet only
one-third of the respondents reported no adverse childhood experiences.
One out of ten individuals responded yes to the question “Did a
parent or other adult in the household often or very often swear
at you, insult you, or put you down?”
More than a quarter responded yes to the questions “Did one of
your parents often or very often push, grab, slap, or throw
something at you?” and “Did one of your parents often or very
often hit you so hard that you had marks or were injured?” In
other words, more than a quarter of the U.S. population is likely
to have been repeatedly physically abused as a child.
T o the questions “Did an adult or person at least 5 years older
ever have you touch their body in a sexual way?” and “Did an
adult or person at least 5 years older ever attempt oral, anal, or
vaginal intercourse with you?” 28 percent of women and 16
percent of men responded af firmatively .
One in eight people responded positively to the questions: “As a
child, did you witness your mother sometimes, often, or very
often pushed, grabbed, slapped, or had something thrown at
her?” “As a child, did you witness your mother sometimes,

often, or very often kicked, bitten, hit with a fist, or hit with
something hard?”15
Each yes answer was scored as one point, leading to a possible ACE
score ranging from zero to ten. For example, a person who experienced
frequent verbal abuse, who had an alcoholic mother , and whose parents
divorced would have an ACE score of three. Of the two-thirds of
respondents who reported an adverse experience, 87 percent scored two or
more. One in six of all respondents had an ACE score of four or higher .
In short, Felitti and his team had found that adverse experiences are
interrelated, even though they’re usually studied separately . People
typically don’ t grow up in a household where one brother is in prison but
everything else is fine. They don’ t live in families where their mother is
regularly beaten but life is otherwise hunky-dory . Incidents of abuse are
never stand-alone events. And for each additional adverse experience
reported, the toll in later damage increases.
Felitti and his team found that the ef fects of childhood trauma first
become evident in school. More than half of those with ACE scores of four
or higher reported having learning or behavioral problems, compared with 3
percent of those with a score of zero. As the children matured, they didn’ t
“outgrow” the ef fects of their early experiences. As Felitti notes,
“T raumatic experiences are often lost in time and concealed by shame,
secrecy , and social taboo,” but the study revealed that the impact of trauma
pervaded these patients’ adult lives. For example, high ACE scores turned
out to correlate with higher workplace absenteeism, financial problems, and
lower lifetime income.
When it came to personal suf fering, the results were devastating. As the
ACE score rises, chronic depression in adulthood also rises dramatically .
For those with an ACE score of four or more, its prevalence is 66 percent in
women and 35 percent in men, compared with an overall rate of 12 percent
in those with an ACE score of zero. The likelihood of being on
antidepressant medication or prescription painkillers also rose
proportionally . As Felitti has pointed out, we may be treating today
experiences that happened fifty years ago—at ever -increasing cost.
Antidepressant drugs and painkillers constitute a significant portion of our

rapidly rising national health-care expenditures.16 (Ironically , research has
shown that depressed patients without prior histories of abuse or neglect
tend to respond much better to antidepressants than patients with those
backgrounds.17)
Self-acknowledged suicide attempts rise exponentially with ACE
scores. From a score of zero to a score of six there is about a 5,000 percent
increased likelihood of suicide attempts. The more isolated and unprotected
a person feels, the more death will feel like the only escape. When the
media report an environmental link to a 30 percent increase in the risk of
some cancer , it is headline news, yet these far more dramatic figures are
overlooked.
As part of their initial medical evaluation, study participants were
asked, “Have you ever considered yourself to be an alcoholic?” People with
an ACE score of four were seven times more likely to be alcoholic than
adults with a score of zero. Injection drug use increased exponentially: For
those with an ACE score of six or more, the likelihood of IV drug use was
4,600 percent greater than in those with a score of zero.
W omen in the study were asked about rape during adulthood. At an
ACE score of zero, the prevalence of rape was 5 percent; at a score of four
or more it was 33 percent. Why are abused or neglected girls so much more
likely to be raped later in life? The answers to this question have
implications far beyond rape. For example, numerous studies  have shown
that girls who witness domestic violence while growing up are at much
higher risk of ending up in violent relationships themselves,  while for boys
who witness domestic violence, the risk that they will abuse their own
partners rises sevenfold.18 More than 12 percent of study participants had
seen their mothers being battered.
The list of high-risk behaviors predicted by the ACE score included
smoking, obesity , unintended pregnancies, multiple sexual partners, and
sexually transmitted diseases. Finally , the toll of major health problems was
striking: Those with an ACE score of six or above had a 15 percent or
greater chance than those with an ACE score of zero of currently suf fering
from any of the ten leading causes of death in the United States, including
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease, and
liver disease. They were twice as likely to suf fer from cancer and four times

as likely to have emphysema. The ongoing stress on the body keeps taking
its toll.
WHEN PROBLEMS ARE REALL Y SOLUTIONS
T welve years after he originally treated her , Felitti again saw the woman
whose dramatic weight loss and gain had started him on his quest. She told
him that she’d subsequently had bariatric sur gery but that after she’d lost
ninety-six pounds she’d become suicidal. It had taken five psychiatric
hospitalizations and three courses of electroshock to control her suicidality .
Felitti points out that obesity , which is considered a major public health
problem, may in fact be a personal solution for many . Consider the
implications: If you mistake someone’ s solution for a problem to be
eliminated, not only are they likely to fail treatment, as often happens in
addiction programs, but other problems may emer ge.
One female rape victim told Felitti, “Overweight is overlooked, and
that’ s the way I need to be.”19 W eight can protect men, as well. Felitti
recalls two guards at a state prison in his obesity program. They promptly
regained the weight they had lost, because they felt a lot safer being the
biggest guy on the cellblock. Another male patient became obese after his
parents divorced and he moved in with his violent alcoholic grandfather . He
explained: “It wasn’ t that I ate because I was hungry and all of that. It was
just a place for me to feel safe. All the way from kinder garten I used to get
beat up all the time. When I got the weight on it didn’ t happen anymore.”
The ACE study group concluded: “Although widely understood to be
harmful to health, each adaptation [such as smoking, drinking, drugs,
obesity] is notably dif ficult to give up. Little consideration is given to the
possibility that many long-term health risks might also be personally
beneficial in the short term. W e repeatedly hear from patients of the benefits
of these ‘health risks.’ The idea of the problem being a solution, while
understandably disturbing to many , is certainly in keeping with the fact that
opposing forces routinely coexist in biological systems. . . . What one sees,
the presenting problem, is often only the marker for the real problem, which
lies buried in time, concealed by patient shame, secrecy and sometimes
amnesia—and frequently clinician discomfort.”

CHILD ABUSE: OUR NA TION’S LARGEST PUBLIC
HEAL TH PROBLEM
The first time I heard Robert Anda present the results of the ACE study , he
could not hold back his tears. In his career at the CDC he had previously
worked in several major risk areas, including tobacco research and
cardiovascular health. But when the ACE study data started to appear on his
computer screen, he realized that they had stumbled upon the gravest and
most costly public health issue in the United States: child abuse. He had
calculated that its overall costs exceeded those of cancer or heart disease
and that eradicating child abuse in America would reduce the overall rate of
depression by more than half, alcoholism by two-thirds, and suicide, IV
drug use, and domestic violence by three-quarters.20 It would also have a
dramatic ef fect on workplace performance and vastly decrease the need for
incarceration.
When the sur geon general’ s report on smoking and health was
published in 1964, it unleashed a decades-long legal and medical campaign
that has changed daily life and long-term health prospects for millions. The
number of American smokers fell from 42 percent of adults in 1965 to 19
percent in 2010, and it is estimated that nearly 800,000 deaths from lung
cancer were prevented between 1975 and 2000.21
The ACE study , however , has had no such ef fect. Follow-up studies
and papers are still appearing around the world, but the day-to-day reality of
children like Marilyn and the children in outpatient clinics and residential
treatment centers around the country remains virtually the same. Only now
they receive high doses of psychotropic agents, which makes them more
tractable but which also impairs their ability to feel pleasure and curiosity ,
to grow and develop emotionally and intellectually , and to become
contributing members of society .

The notion that early childhood adverse experiences lead to
substantial developmental disruptions is more clinical intuition
than a research-based fact. There is no known evidence of
developmental disruptions that were preceded in time in a causal
fashion by any type of trauma syndrome.
—Fr om the American Psychiatric Association’ s r ejection of a Developmental
T rauma Disorder diagnosis, May 201 1
Research on the ef fects of early maltreatment tells a dif ferent
story: that early maltreatment has enduring negative ef fects on
brain development. Our brains are sculpted by our early
experiences. Maltreatment is a chisel that shapes a brain to contend
with strife, but at the cost of deep, enduring wounds. Childhood
abuse isn’ t something you “get over .” It is an evil that we must
acknowledge and confront if we aim to do anything about the
unchecked cycle of violence in this country .
—Martin T eicher , MD, PhD, Scientific American
here are hundreds of thousands of children like the ones I am about to
describe, and they absorb enormous resources, often without

appreciable benefit. They end up filling our jails, our welfare rolls, and our
medical clinics. Most of the public knows them only as statistics. T ens of
thousands of schoolteachers, probation of ficers, welfare workers, judges,
and mental health professionals spend their days trying to help them, and
the taxpayer pays the bills.
Anthony was only two and a half when he was referred to our T rauma
Center by a child-care center because its employees could not manage his
constant biting and pushing, his refusal to take naps, and his intractable
crying, head banging, and rocking. He did not feel safe with any staf f
member and fluctuated between despondent collapse and angry defiance.
When we met with him and his mother , he anxiously clung to her ,
hiding his face, while she kept saying, “Don’ t be such a baby .” He startled
when a door banged somewhere down the corridor and then burrowed
deeper into his mom’ s lap. When she pushed him away , he sat in a corner
and started to bang his head. “He just does that to bug me,” his mother
remarked. When we asked about her own background, she told us that she’d
been abandoned by her parents and raised by a series of relatives who hit
her , ignored her , and started to sexually abuse her at age thirteen. She’d
become pregnant by a drunken boyfriend who left her when she told him
she was carrying his child. Anthony was just like his father , she said—a
good-for -nothing. She had had numerous violent rows with subsequent
boyfriends, but she was sure that this had happened too late at night for
Anthony to notice.
If Anthony were admitted to a hospital, he would likely be diagnosed
with a host of dif ferent psychiatric disorders: depression, oppositional
defiant disorder , anxiety , reactive attachment disorder , ADHD, and PTSD.
None of these diagnoses, however , would clarify what was wrong with
Anthony: that he was scared to death and fighting for his life, and he did not
trust that his mother could help him.
Then there’ s Maria, a fifteen-year -old Latina, one of the more than half
a million kids in the United States who grow up in foster care and
residential treatment programs. Maria is obese and aggressive. She has a
history of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse and has lived in more than
twenty out-of-home placements since age eight. The pile of medical charts
that arrived with her described her as mute, vengeful, impulsive, reckless,

and self-harming, with extreme mood swings and an explosive temper . She
describes herself as “garbage, worthless, rejected.”
After multiple suicide attempts Maria was placed in one of our
residential treatment centers. Initially she was mute and withdrawn and
became violent when people got too close to her . After other approaches
failed to work, she was placed in an equine therapy program where she
groomed her horse daily and learned simple dressage. T wo years later I
spoke with Maria at her high school graduation. She had been accepted by a
four -year college. When I asked her what had helped her most, she
answered, “The horse I took care of.” She told me that she first started to
feel safe with her horse; he was there every day , patiently waiting for her ,
seemingly glad upon her approach. She started to feel a visceral connection
with another creature and began to talk to him like a friend. Gradually she
started talking with the other kids in the program and, eventually , with her
counselor .
V ir ginia is a thirteen-year -old adopted white girl. She was taken away
from her biological mother because of the mother ’ s drug abuse; after her
first adoptive mother fell ill and died, she moved from foster home to foster
home before being adopted again. V ir ginia was seductive with any male
who crossed her path, and she reported sexual and physical abuse by
various babysitters and temporary caregivers. She came to our residential
treatment program after thirteen crisis hospitalizations for suicide attempts.
The staf f described her as isolated, controlling, explosive, sexualized,
intrusive, vindictive, and narcissistic. She described herself as disgusting
and said she wished she were dead. The diagnoses in her chart were bipolar
disorder , intermittent explosive disorder , reactive attachment disorder ,
attention deficit disorder (ADD) hyperactive subtype, oppositional defiant
disorder (ODD), and substance use disorder . But who, really , is V ir ginia?
How can we help her have a life?1
W e can hope to solve the problems of these children only if we
correctly define what is going on with them and do more than developing
new drugs to control them or trying to find “the” gene that is responsible for
their “disease.” The challenge is to find ways to help them lead productive
lives and, in so doing, save hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’
money . That process starts with facing the facts.

BAD GENES?
W ith such pervasive problems and such dysfunctional parents we would be
tempted to ascribe their problems simply to bad genes. T echnology always
produces new directions for research, and when it became possible to do
genetic testing, psychiatry became committed to finding the genetic causes
of mental illness. Finding a genetic link seemed particularly relevant for
schizophrenia, a fairly common (af fecting about 1 percent of the
population), severe, and perplexing form of mental illness and one that
clearly runs in families. And yet after thirty years and millions upon
millions of dollars’ worth of research, we have failed to find consistent
genetic patterns for schizophrenia—or for any other psychiatric illness, for
that matter .2 Some of my colleagues have also worked hard to discover
genetic factors that predispose people to develop traumatic stress.3 That
quest continues, but so far it has failed to yield any solid answers.4
Recent research has swept away the simple idea that “having” a
particular gene produces a particular result. It turns out that many genes
work together to influence a single outcome. Even more important, genes
are not fixed; life events  can trigger biochemical messages that  turn them
on or of f by attaching methyl groups, a cluster of carbon and hydrogen
atoms, to the outside of the gene (a process called methylation), making it
more or less sensitive to messages from the body . While life events can
change the behavior of the gene, they do not alter its fundamental structure.
Methylation patterns, however , can be passed on to of fspring—a
phenomenon known as epigenetics. Once again, the body keeps the score,
at the deepest levels of the or ganism.
One of the most cited experiments in epigenetics was conducted by
McGill University researcher Michael Meaney , who studies newborn rat
pups and their mothers.5 He discovered that how much a mother rat licks
and grooms her pups during the first twelve hours after their birth
permanently af fects the brain chemicals that respond to stress—and
modifies the configuration of over a thousand genes. The rat pups that are
intensively licked by their mothers are braver and produce lower levels of
stress hormones under stress than rats whose mothers are less attentive.
They also recover more quickly—an equanimity that lasts throughout their

lives. They develop thicker connections in the hippocampus, a key center
for learning and memory , and they perform better in an important rodent
skill—finding their way through mazes.
W e are just beginning to learn that stressful experiences af fect gene
expression in humans, as well. Children whose pregnant mothers had been
trapped in unheated houses in a prolonged ice storm in Quebec had major
epigenetic changes compared with the children of mothers whose heat had
been restored within a day .6 McGill researcher Moshe Szyf compared the
epigenetic profiles of hundreds of children born into the extreme ends of
social privilege in the United Kingdom and measured the ef fects of child
abuse on both groups. Dif ferences in social class were associated with
distinctly dif ferent epigenetic profiles, but abused children in both groups
had in common specific modifications in seventy-three genes. In Szyf ’ s
words, “Major changes to our bodies can be made not just by chemicals and
toxins, but also in the way the social world talks to the hard-wired
world.”7 , 8
MONKEYS CLARIFY OLD QUESTIONS ABOUT NA TURE
VERSUS NUR TURE
One of the clearest ways of understanding how the quality of parenting and
environment af fects the expression of genes comes from the work of
Stephen Suomi, chief of the National Institutes of Health’ s Laboratory of
Comparative Ethology .9 For more than forty years Suomi has been studying
the transmission of personality through generations of rhesus monkeys,
which share 95 percent of human genes, a number exceeded only by
chimpanzees and bonobos. Like humans, rhesus monkeys live in lar ge
social groups with complex alliances and status relationships, and only
members who can synchronize their behavior with the demands of the troop
survive and flourish.
Rhesus monkeys are also like humans in their attachment patterns.
Their infants depend on intimate physical contact with their mothers, and
just as Bowlby observed in humans, they develop by exploring their
reactions to their environment, running back to their mothers whenever they

feel scared or lost. Once they become more independent, play with their
peers is the primary way they learn to get along in life.
Suomi identified two personality types that consistently ran into
trouble: uptight, anxious monkeys, who become fearful, withdrawn, and
depressed even in situations where other monkeys will play and explore;
and highly aggressive monkeys, who make so much trouble that they are
often shunned, beaten up, or killed. Both types are biologically dif ferent
from their peers. Abnormalities in arousal levels, stress hormones, and
metabolism of brain chemicals like serotonin can be detected within the
first few weeks of life, and neither their biology nor their behavior tends to
change as they mature. Suomi discovered a wide range of genetically driven
behaviors. For example, the uptight monkeys (classified as such on the
basis of both their behavior and their high cortisol levels at six months) will
consume more alcohol in experimental situations than the others when they
reach the age of four . The genetically aggressive monkeys also overindulge
—but they binge drink to the point of passing out, while the uptight
monkeys seem to drink to calm down.
And yet the social environment also contributes significantly to
behavior and biology . The uptight, anxious females don’ t play well with
others and thus often lack social support when they give birth and are at
high risk for neglecting or abusing their firstborns. But when these females
belong to a stable social group they often become diligent mothers who
carefully watch out for their young. Under some conditions being an
anxious mom can provide much needed protection. The aggressive mothers,
on the other hand, did not provide any social advantages: very punitive with
their of fspring, there is lots of hitting, kicking, and biting. If the infants
survive, their mothers usually keep them from making friends with their
peers.
In real life it is impossible to tell whether people’ s aggressive or uptight
behavior is the result of parents’ genes or of having been raised by an
abusive mother—or both. But in a monkey lab you can take newborns with
vulnerable genes away from their biological mothers and have them raised
by supportive mothers or in playgroups with peers.
Y oung monkeys who are taken away from their mothers at birth and
brought up solely with their peers become intensely attached to them. They
desperately cling to one another and don’ t peel away enough to engage in

healthy exploration and play . What little play there is lacks the complexity
and imagination typical of normal monkeys. These monkeys grow up to be
uptight: scared in new situations and lacking in curiosity . Regardless of
their genetic predisposition, peer -raised monkeys overreact to minor
stresses: Their cortisol increases much more in response to loud noises than
does that of monkeys who were raised by their mothers. Their serotonin
metabolism is even more abnormal than that of the monkeys who are
genetically predisposed to aggression but who were raised by their own
mothers. This leads to the conclusion that, at least in monkeys, early
experience has at least as much impact on biology as heredity does.
Monkeys and humans share the same two variants of the serotonin gene
(known as the short and long serotonin transporter alleles). In humans the
short allele has been associated with impulsivity , aggression, sensation
seeking, suicide attempts, and severe depression. Suomi showed that, at
least in monkeys, the environment shapes how these genes af fect behavior .
Monkeys with the short allele that were raised by an adequate mother
behaved normally and had no deficit in their serotonin metabolism. Those
who were raised with their peers became aggressive risk takers.10 Similarly ,
New Zealand researcher Alec Roy found that humans  with the short allele
had higher rates of depression than those with the long version but that this
was true only if they also had a childhood history of abuse or neglect. The
conclusion is clear: Children who are fortunate enough to have an attuned
and attentive parent are not going to develop this genetically related
problem.1 1
Suomi’ s work supports everything we’ve learned from our colleagues
who study human attachment and from our own clinical research: Safe and
protective early relationships are critical to protect children from long-term
problems. In addition, even parents with their own genetic vulnerabilities
can pass on that protection to the next generation provided that they are
given the right support.
THE NA TIONAL CHILD TRAUMA TIC STRESS
NETWORK

Nearly every medical disease, from cancer to retinitis pigmentosa, has
advocacy groups that promote the study and treatment of that particular
condition. But until 2001, when the National Child T raumatic Stress
Network was established by an act of Congress, there was no
comprehensive or ganization dedicated to the research and treatment of
traumatized children.
In 1998 I received a call from Adam Cummings from the Nathan
Cummings Foundation telling me that they were interested in studying the
ef fects of trauma on learning. I told them that while some very good work
had been done on that subject,12 there was no forum to implement the
discoveries that had already been made. The mental, biological, or moral
development of traumatized children was not being systematically taught to
child-care workers, to pediatricians, or in graduate schools of psychology or
social work.
Adam and I agreed that we had to address this problem. Some eight
months later we convened a think tank that included representatives from
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S.
Department of Justice, Senator T ed Kennedy’ s health-care adviser , and a
group of my colleagues who specialized in childhood trauma. W e all were
familiar with the basics of how trauma af fects the developing mind and
brain, and we all were aware that childhood trauma is radically dif ferent
from traumatic stress in fully formed adults. The group concluded that, if
we hoped to ever put the issue of childhood trauma firmly on the map, there
needed to be a national or ganization that would promote both the study of
childhood trauma and the education of teachers, judges, ministers, foster
parents, physicians, probation of ficers, nurses, and mental health
professionals—anyone who deals with abused and traumatized kids.
One member of our work group, Bill Harris, had extensive experience
with child-related legislation, and he went to work with Senator Kennedy’ s
staf f to craft our ideas into law . The bill establishing the National Child
T raumatic Stress Network was ushered through the Senate with
overwhelming bipartisan support, and since 2001 it has grown from a
collaborative network of 17 sites to more than 150 centers nationwide. Led
by coordinating centers at Duke University and UCLA, the NCTSN
includes universities, hospitals, tribal agencies, drug rehab programs,

mental health clinics, and graduate schools. Each of the sites, in turn,
collaborates with local school systems, hospitals, welfare agencies,
homeless shelters, juvenile justice programs, and domestic violence
shelters, with a total of well over 8,300 af filiated partners.
Once the NCTSN was up and running, we had the means to assemble a
clearer profile of traumatized kids in every part of the country . My T rauma
Center colleague Joseph Spinazzola led a survey that examined the records
of nearly two thousand children and adolescents from agencies across the
network.13 W e soon confirmed what we had suspected: The vast majority
came from extremely dysfunctional families. More than half had been
emotionally abused and/or had a caregiver who was too impaired to care for
their needs. Almost 50 percent had temporarily lost caregivers to jail,
treatment programs, or military service and had been looked after by
strangers, foster parents, or distant relatives. About half reported having
witnessed domestic violence, and a quarter were also victims of sexual and
/or physical abuse. In other words, the children and adolescents in the
survey were mirrors of the middle-aged, middle-class Kaiser Permanente
patients with high ACE scores that V incent Felitti had studied in the
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study .
THE POWER OF DIAGNOSIS
In the 1970s there was no way to classify the wide-ranging symptoms of
hundreds of thousands of returning V ietnam veterans. As we saw in the
opening chapters of this book, this forced clinicians to improvise the
treatment of their patients and prevented them from being able to
systematically study what approaches actually worked. The adoption of the
PTSD diagnosis by the DSM III in 1980 led to extensive scientific studies
and to the development of ef fective treatments, which turned out to be
relevant not only to combat veterans but also to victims of a range of
traumatic events, including rape, assault, and motor vehicle accidents.14 An
example of the far -ranging power of having a specific diagnosis is the fact
that between 2007 and 2010 the Department of Defense spent more than
$2.7 billion for the treatment of and research on PTSD in combat veterans,

while in fiscal year 2009 alone the Department of V eterans Af fairs spent
$24.5 million on in-house PTSD research.
The DSM definition of PTSD is quite straightforward: A person is
exposed to a horrendous event “that involved actual or threatened death or
serious injury , or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others,” causing
“intense fear , helplessness, or horror ,” which results in a variety of
manifestations: intrusive reexperiencing of the event (flashbacks, bad
dreams, feeling as if the event were occurring), persistent and crippling
avoidance (of people, places, thoughts, or feelings associated with the
trauma, sometimes with amnesia for important parts of it), and increased
arousal (insomnia, hypervigilance, or irritability). This description suggests
a clear story line: A person is suddenly and unexpectedly devastated by an
atrocious event and is never the same again. The trauma may be over , but it
keeps being replayed in continually recycling memories and in a
reor ganized nervous system.
How relevant was this definition to the children we were seeing? After
a single traumatic incident—a dog bite, an accident, or witnessing a school
shooting—children can indeed develop basic PTSD symptoms similar to
those of adults, even if they live in safe and supportive homes. As a result
of having the PTSD diagnosis, we now can treat those problems quite
ef fectively .
In the case of the troubled children with histories of abuse and neglect
who show up in clinics, schools, hospitals, and police stations, the traumatic
roots of their behaviors are less obvious, particularly because they rarely
talk about having been hit, abandoned, or molested, even when asked.
Eighty two percent of the traumatized children seen in the National Child
T raumatic Stress Network do not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD.15
Because they often are shut down, suspicious, or aggressive they now
receive pseudoscientific diagnoses such as “oppositional defiant disorder ,”
meaning “This kid hates my guts and won’ t do anything I tell him to do,” or
“disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ,” meaning he has temper tantrums.
Having as many problems as they do, these kids accumulate numerous
diagnoses over time. Before they reach their twenties, many patients have
been given four , five, six, or more of these impressive but meaningless
labels. If they receive treatment at all, they get whatever is being

promulgated as the method of management du jour: medications, behavioral
modification, or exposure therapy . These rarely work and often cause more
damage.
As the NCTSN treated more and more kids, it became increasingly
obvious that we needed a diagnosis that captured the reality of their
experience. W e began with a database of nearly twenty thousand kids who
were being treated in various sites within the network and collected all the
research articles we could find on abused and neglected kids. These were
winnowed down to 130 particularly relevant studies that reported on more
than one hundred thousand children and adolescents worldwide. A core
work group of twelve clinician/researchers specializing in childhood
trauma16 then convened twice a year for four years to draft a proposal for an
appropriate diagnosis, which we decided to call Developmental T rauma
Disorder .17
As we or ganized our findings, we discovered a consistent profile: (1) a
pervasive pattern of dysregulation, (2) problems with attention and
concentration, and (3) dif ficulties getting along with themselves and others.
These children’ s moods and feelings rapidly shifted from one extreme to
another—from temper tantrums and panic to detachment, flatness, and
dissociation. When they got upset (which was much of the time), they could
neither calm themselves down nor describe what they were feeling.
Having a biological system that keeps pumping out stress hormones to
deal with real or imagined threats leads to physical problems: sleep
disturbances, headaches, unexplained pain, oversensitivity to touch or
sound. Being so agitated or shut down keeps them from being able to focus
their attention and concentration. T o relieve their tension, they engage in
chronic masturbation, rocking, or self-harming activities (biting, cutting,
burning, and hitting themselves, pulling their hair out, picking at their skin
until it bled). It also leads to dif ficulties with language processing and fine-
motor coordination. Spending all their ener gy on staying in control, they
usually have trouble paying attention to things, like schoolwork, that are not
directly relevant to survival, and their hyperarousal makes them easily
distracted.
Having been frequently ignored or abandoned leaves them clinging and
needy , even with the people who have abused them. Having been

chronically beaten, molested, and otherwise mistreated, they can not help
but define themselves as defective and worthless. They come by their self-
loathing, sense of defectiveness, and worthlessness honestly . W as it any
surprise that they didn’ t trust anyone? Finally , the combination of feeling
fundamentally despicable and overreacting to slight frustrations makes it
dif ficult for them to make friends.
W e published the first articles about our findings, developed a validated
rating scale,18 and collected data on about 350 kids and their parents or
foster parents to establish that this one diagnosis, Developmental T rauma
Disorder , captured the full range of what was wrong with these children. It
would enable us to give them a single diagnosis, as opposed to multiple
labels, and would firmly locate the origin of their problems in a
combination of trauma and compromised attachment.
In February 2009 we submitted our proposed new diagnosis of
Developmental T rauma Disorder to the American Psychiatric Association,
stating the following in a cover letter:
Children who develop in the context of ongoing danger ,
maltreatment and disrupted caregiving systems are being ill served
by the current diagnostic systems that lead to an emphasis on
behavioral control with no recognition of interpersonal trauma.
Studies on the sequelae of childhood trauma in the context of
caregiver abuse or neglect consistently demonstrate chronic and
severe problems with emotion regulation, impulse control,
attention and cognition, dissociation, interpersonal relationships,
and self and relational schemas. In absence of a sensitive trauma-
specific diagnosis, such children are currently diagnosed with an
average of 3–8 co-morbid disorders. The continued practice of
applying multiple distinct co-morbid diagnoses to traumatized
children has grave consequences: it defies parsimony , obscures
etiological clarity , and runs the danger of relegating treatment and
intervention to a small aspect of the child’ s psychopathology rather
than promoting a comprehensive treatment approach.

Shortly after submitting our proposal, I gave a talk on Developmental
T rauma Disorder in W ashington DC to a meeting of the mental health
commissioners from across the country . They of fered to support our
initiative by writing a letter to the AP A. The letter began by pointing out
that the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors
served 6.1 million people annually , with a budget of $29.5 billion, and
concluded: “W e ur ge the AP A to add developmental trauma to its list of
priority areas to clarify and better characterize its course and clinical
sequelae and to emphasize the strong need to address developmental trauma
in the assessment of patients.”
I felt confident that this letter would ensure that the AP A would take
our proposal seriously , but several months after our submission, Matthew
Friedman, executive director of the National Center for PTSD and chair of
the relevant DSM subcommittee, informed us that DTD was unlikely to be
included in the DSM-5. The consensus, he wrote, was that no new diagnosis
was required to fill a “missing diagnostic niche.” One million children who
are abused and neglected every year in the United States a “diagnostic
niche”?
The letter went on: “The notion that early childhood adverse
experiences lead to substantial developmental disruptions is more clinical
intuition than a research-based fact. This statement is commonly made but
cannot be backed up by prospective studies.” In fact, we had included
several prospective studies in our proposal. Let’ s look at just  two of them
here.
HOW RELA TIONSHIPS SHAPE DEVELOPMENT
Beginning in 1975 and continuing for almost thirty years, Alan Sroufe and
his colleagues tracked 180 children and their families through the
Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation.19 At the time the
study began there was an intense debate about the role of nature versus
nurture, and temperament versus environment in human development, and
this study set out to answer those questions. T rauma was not yet a popular
topic, and child abuse and neglect were not a central focus of this study—at

least initially , until they emer ged as the most important predictors of adult
functioning.
W orking with local medical and social agencies, the researchers
recruited first-time (Caucasian) mothers who were poor enough to qualify
for public assistance but who had dif ferent backgrounds and dif ferent kinds
and levels of support available for parenting. The study began three months
before the children were born and followed the children for thirty years into
adulthood, assessing and, where relevant, measuring all the major aspects of
their functioning and all the significant circumstances of their lives. It
considered several fundamental questions: How do children learn to pay
attention while regulating their arousal (i.e., avoiding extreme highs or
lows) and keeping their impulses under control? What kinds of supports do
they need, and when are these needed?
After extensive interviews and testing of the prospective parents, the
study really got of f the ground in the newborn nursery , where researchers
observed the newborns and interviewed the nurses caring for them. They
then made home visits seven and ten days after birth. Before the children
entered first grade, they and their parents were carefully assessed a total of
fifteen times. After that, the children were interviewed and tested at regular
intervals until age twenty-eight, with continuing input from mothers and
teachers.
Sroufe and his colleagues found that quality of care and biological
factors were closely interwoven. It is fascinating to see how the Minnesota
results echo—though with far greater complexity—what Stephen Suomi
found in his primate laboratory . Nothing was written in stone. Neither the
mother ’ s personality , nor the infant’ s neurological anomalies at birth, nor its
IQ, nor its temperament—including its activity level and reactivity to stress
—predicted whether a child would develop serious behavioral problems in
adolescence.20 The key issue, rather , was the nature of the parent-child
relationship: how parents  felt about and interacted with their kids. As with
Suomi’ s monkeys, the combination of vulnerable infants and inflexible
caregivers made for clingy , uptight kids. Insensitive, pushy , and intrusive
behavior on the part of the parents at six months predicted hyperactivity and
attention problems in kinder garten and beyond.21

Focusing on many facets of development, particularly relationships
with caregivers, teachers, and peers, Sroufe and his colleagues found that
caregivers not only help keep arousal within manageable bounds but also
help infants develop their own ability to regulate their arousal. Children
who were regularly pushed over the edge into overarousal and
disor ganization did not develop proper attunement of their inhibitory and
excitatory brain systems and grew up expecting that they would lose control
if something upsetting happened. This was a vulnerable population, and by
late adolescence half of them had diagnosable mental health problems.
There were clear patterns: The children who received consistent caregiving
became well-regulated kids, while erratic caregiving produced kids who
were chronically physiologically aroused. The children of unpredictable
parents often clamored for attention and became intensely frustrated in the
face of small challenges. Their persistent arousal made them chronically
anxious. Constantly looking for reassurance got in the way of playing and
exploration, and, as a result, they grew up chronically nervous and
nonadventurous.
Early parental neglect or harsh treatment led to behavior problems in
school and predicted troubles with peers and a lack of empathy for the
distress of others.22 This set up a vicious cycle: Their chronic arousal,
coupled with lack of parental comfort, made them disruptive, oppositional,
and aggressive. Disruptive and aggressive kids are unpopular and provoke
further rejection and punishment, not only from their caregivers but also
from their teachers and peers.23
Sroufe also learned a great deal about resilience: the capacity to bounce
back from adversity . By far the most important predictor of how well his
subjects coped with life’ s inevitable disappointments was the level of
security established with their primary caregiver during the first two years
of life. Sroufe informally told me that he thought that resilience in
adulthood could be predicted by how lovable mothers rated their kids at age
two.24
THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF INCEST

In 1986 Frank Putnam and Penelope T rickett, his colleague at the National
Institute of Mental Health, initiated the first longitudinal study of the impact
of sexual abuse on female development.25 Until the results of this study
came out, our knowledge about the ef fects of incest was based entirely on
reports from children who had recently disclosed their abuse and on
accounts from adults reconstructing years or even decades later how incest
had af fected them. No study had ever followed girls as they matured to
examine how sexual abuse might influence their school performance, peer
relationships, and self-concept, as well as their later dating life. Putnam and
T rickett also looked at changes over time in their subjects’ stress hormones,
reproductive hormones, immune function, and other physiological
measures. In addition they explored potential protective factors, such as
intelligence and support from family and peers.
The researchers painstakingly recruited eighty-four girls referred by the
District of Columbia Department of Social Services who had a confirmed
history of sexual abuse by a family member . These were matched with a
comparison group of eighty-two girls of the same age, race, socioeconomic
status, and family constellation who had not been abused. The average
starting age was eleven. Over the next twenty years these two groups were
thoroughly assessed six times, once a year for the first three years and again
at ages eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-five. Their mothers participated in
the early assessments, and their own children took part in the last. A
remarkable 96 percent of the girls, now grown women, have stayed in the
study from its inception.
The results were unambiguous: Compared with girls of the same age,
race, and social circumstances, sexually abused girls suf fer from a lar ge
range of profoundly negative ef fects, including cognitive deficits,
depression, dissociative symptoms, troubled sexual development, high rates
of obesity , and self-mutilation. They dropped out of high school at a higher
rate than the control group and had more major illnesses and health-care
utilization. They also showed abnormalities in their stress hormone
responses, had an earlier onset of puberty , and accumulated a host of
dif ferent, seemingly unrelated, psychiatric diagnoses.
The follow-up research revealed many details of how abuse af fects
development. For example, each time they were assessed, the girls in both

groups were asked to talk about the worst thing that had happened to them
during the previous year . As they told their stories, the researchers observed
how upset they became, while measuring their physiology . During the first
assessment all the girls reacted by becoming distressed. Three years later , in
response to the same question,  the nonabused girls once again displayed
signs of distress, but the abused girls shut down and became numb. Their
biology matched their observable reactions: During the first assessment all
of the girls showed an increase in the stress hormone cortisol; three years
later cortisol went down in the abused girls as they reported on the most
stressful event of the past year . Over time the body adjusts to chronic
trauma. One of the consequences of numbing is that teachers, friends, and
others are not likely to notice that a girl is upset; she may not even register
it herself. By numbing out she no longer reacts to distress the way she
should, for example, by taking protective action.
Putnam’ s study also captured the pervasive long-term ef fects of incest
on friendships and partnering. Before the onset of puberty nonabused girls
usually have several girlfriends, as well as one boy who functions as a sort
of spy who informs them about what these strange creatures, boys, are all
about. After they enter adolescence, their contacts with boys gradually
increase. In contrast, before puberty the abused girls rarely have close
friends, girls or boys, but adolescence brings many chaotic and often
traumatizing contacts with boys.
Lacking friends in elementary school makes a crucial dif ference. T oday
we’re aware how cruel third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade girls can be. It’ s a
complex and rocky time when friends can suddenly turn on one another and
alliances dissolve in exclusions and betrayals. But there is an upside: By the
time girls get to middle school, most have begun to master a whole set of
social skills, including being able to identify what they feel, negotiating
relationships with others, pretending to like people they don’ t, and so on.
And most of them have built a fairly steady support network of girls who
become their stress-debriefing team. As they slowly enter the world of sex
and dating, these relationships give them room for reflection, gossip, and
discussion of what it all means.
The sexually abused girls have an entirely dif ferent developmental
pathway . They don’ t have friends of either gender because they can’ t trust;
they hate themselves, and their biology is against them, leading them either

to overreact or numb out. They can’ t keep up in the normal envy-driven
inclusion/exclusion games, in which players have to stay cool under stress.
Other kids usually don’ t want anything to do with them—they simply are
too weird.
But that’ s only the beginning of the trouble. The abused, isolated girls
with incest histories mature sexually a year and a half earlier than the
nonabused girls. Sexual abuse speeds up their biological clocks and the
secretion of sex hormones. Early in puberty the abused girls had three to
five times the levels of testosterone and androstenedione, the hormones that
fuel sexual desire, as the girls in the control group.
Results of Putnam and T rickett’ s study continue to be published, but it
has already created an invaluable road map for clinicians dealing with
sexually abused girls. At the T rauma Center , for example, one of our
clinicians reported on a Monday morning that a patient named A yesha had
been raped—again—over the weekend. She had run away from her group
home at five o’clock on Saturday , gone to a place in Boston where druggies
hang out, smoked some dope and done some other drugs, and then left with
a bunch of boys in a car . At five o’clock Sunday morning they had gang-
raped her . Like so many of the adolescents we see, A yesha can’ t articulate
what she wants or needs and can’ t think through how she might protect
herself. Instead, she lives in a world of actions. T rying to explain her
behavior in terms of victim/perpetrator isn’ t helpful, nor are labels like
“depression,” “oppositional defiant disorder ,” “intermittent explosive
disorder ,” “bipolar disorder ,” or any of the other options our diagnostic
manuals of fer us. Putnam’ s work has helped us understand how A yesha
experiences the world—why she cannot tell us what is going on with her ,
why she is so impulsive and lacking in self-protection, and why she views
us as frightening and intrusive rather than as people who can help her .
THE DSM-5: A VERIT ABLE SMORGASBORD OF
“DIAGNOSES”
When DSM-5 was published in May 2013 it included some three hundred
disorders in its 945 pages. It of fers a veritable smor gasbord of possible
labels for the problems associated with severe early-life trauma, including

some new ones such as Disruptive Mood Regulation Disorder ,26 Non-
suicidal Self Injury , Intermittent Explosive Disorder , Dysregulated Social
Engagement Disorder , and Disruptive Impulse Control Disorder .27
Before the late nineteenth century doctors classified illnesses according
to their surface manifestations, like fevers and pustules, which was not
unreasonable, given that they had little else to go on.28 This changed when
scientists like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch discovered that many
diseases were caused by bacteria that were invisible to the naked eye.
Medicine then was transformed by its attempts to discover ways to get rid
of those or ganisms rather than just treating the boils and the fevers that they
caused. W ith DSM-5 psychiatry firmly regressed to early-nineteenth-
century medical practice. Despite the fact that we know the origin of many
of the problems it identifies, its “diagnoses” describe surface phenomena
that completely ignore the underlying causes.
Even before DSM-5 was released, the American Journal of Psychiatry
published the results of validity tests of various new diagnoses, which
indicated that the DSM lar gely lacks what in the world of science is known
as “reliability”—the ability to produce consistent, replicable results. In
other words, it lacks scientific validity . Oddly , the lack of reliability and
validity did not keep the DSM-5 from meeting its deadline for publication,
despite the near -universal consensus that it represented no improvement
over the previous diagnostic system.29 Could the fact that the AP A had
earned $100 million on the DSM-IV and is slated to take in a similar
amount with the DSM-5 (because all mental health practitioners, many
lawyers, and other professionals will be obliged to purchase the latest
edition) be the reason we have this new diagnostic system?
Diagnostic reliability isn’ t an abstract issue: If doctors can’ t agree on
what ails their patients, there is no way they can provide proper treatment.
When there’ s no relationship between diagnosis and cure, a mislabeled
patient is bound to be a mistreated patient. Y ou would not want to have your
appendix removed when you are suf fering from a kidney stone, and you
would not want have somebody labeled as “oppositional” when, in fact, his
behavior is rooted in an attempt to protect himself against real danger .
In a statement released in June 201 1, the British Psychological Society
complained to the AP A that the sources of psychological suf fering in the

DSM-5 were identified “as located within individuals” and overlooked the
“undeniable social causation of many such problems.”30 This was in
addition to a flood of protest from American professionals, including
leaders of the American Psychological Association and the American
Counseling Association. Why are relationships or social conditions left out?
31 If you pay attention only to faulty biology and defective genes as the
cause of mental problems and ignore abandonment, abuse, and deprivation,
you are likely to run into as many dead ends as previous generations did
blaming it all on terrible mothers.
The most stunning rejection of the DSM-5 came from the National
Institute of Mental Health, which funds most psychiatric research in
America. In April 2013, a few weeks before DSM-5 was formally released,
NIMH director Thomas Insel announced that his agency could no longer
support DSM’ s “symptom-based diagnosis.”32 Instead the institute would
focus its funding on what are called Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)33 to
create a framework for studies that would cut across current diagnostic
categories. For example, one of the NIMH domains is “Arousal/Modulatory
Systems (Arousal, Circadian Rhythm, Sleep and W akefulness),” which are
disturbed to varying degrees in many patients.
Like the DSM-5, the RDoC framework conceptualizes mental illnesses
solely as brain disorders. This means that future research funding will
explore the brain circuits “and other neurobiological measures” that
underlie mental problems. Insel sees this as a first step toward the sort of
“precision medicine that has transformed cancer diagnosis and treatment.”
Mental illness, however , is not at all like cancer: Humans are social
animals, and mental problems involve not being able to get along with other
people, not fitting in, not belonging, and in general not being able to get on
the same wavelength.
Everything about us—our brains, our minds, and our bodies—is geared
toward collaboration in social systems. This is our most powerful survival
strategy , the key to our success as a species, and it is precisely this that
breaks down in most forms of mental suf fering. As we saw in part 2, the
neural connections in brain and body are vitally important for
understanding human suf fering, but it is important not to ignore the
foundations of our humanity: relationships and interactions that shape our

minds and brains when we are young and that give substance and meaning
to our entire lives.
People with histories of abuse, neglect, or severe deprivation will
remain mysterious and lar gely untreated unless we heed the admonition of
Alan Sroufe: “T o fully understand how we become the persons we are—the
complex, step-by-step evolution of our orientations, capacities, and
behavior over time—requires more than a list of ingredients, however
important any one of them might be. It requires an understanding of the
process of development, how all of these factors work together in an
ongoing way over time.”34
Frontline mental health workers—overwhelmed and underpaid social
workers and therapists alike—seem to agree with our approach. Shortly
after the AP A rejected Developmental T rauma Disorder for inclusion in the
DSM, thousands of clinicians from around the country sent small
contributions to the T rauma Center to help us conduct a lar ge scientific
study , known as a field trial, to further study DTD. That support has
enabled us to interview hundreds of kids, parents, foster parents, and mental
health workers at five dif ferent network sites over the last few years with
scientifically constructed interview tools. The first results from these
studies have now been published, and more will appear as this book is
going to print.35
WHA T DIFFERENCE WOULD DTD MAKE?
One answer is that it would focus research and treatment (not to mention
funding) on the central principles that underlie the protean symptoms of
chronically traumatized children and adults: pervasive biological and
emotional dysregulation, failed or disrupted attachment, problems staying
focused and on track, and a hugely deficient sense of coherent personal
identity and competence. These issues transcend and include almost all
diagnostic categories, but treatment that doesn’ t put them front and center is
more than likely to miss the mark. Our great challenge is to apply the
lessons of neuroplasticity , the flexibility of brain circuits, to rewire the
brains and reor ganize the minds of people who have been programmed by
life itself to experience others as threats and themselves as helpless.

Social support is a biological necessity , not an option, and this reality
should be the backbone of all prevention and treatment. Recognizing the
profound ef fects of trauma and deprivation on child development need not
lead to blaming parents. W e can assume that parents do the best they can,
but all parents need help to nurture their kids. Nearly every industrialized
nation, with the exception of the United States, recognizes this and provides
some form of guaranteed support to families. James Heckman, winner of
the 2000 Nobel Prize in Economics, has shown that quality early-childhood
programs that  involve parents and promote basic skills in disadvantaged
children more than pay for themselves in improved outcomes.36
In the early 1970s psychologist David Olds was working in a Baltimore
day-care center where many of the preschoolers came from homes wracked
by poverty , domestic violence, and drug abuse. A ware that only addressing
the children’ s problems at school was not suf ficient to improve their home
conditions, he started a home-visitation program in which skilled nurses
helped mothers to provide a safe and stimulating environment for their
children and, in the process, to imagine a better future for themselves.
T wenty years later , the children of the home-visitation mothers were not
only healthier but also less likely to report having been abused or neglected
than a similar group whose mothers had not been visited. They also were
more likely to have finished school, to have stayed out of jail, and to be
working in well-paying jobs. Economists have calculated that every dollar
invested in high-quality home visitation, day care, and preschool programs
results in seven dollars of savings on welfare payments, health-care costs,
substance-abuse treatment, and incarceration, plus higher tax revenues due
to better -paying jobs.37
When I go to Europe to teach, I often am contacted by of ficials at the
ministries of health in the Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom,
Germany , or the Netherlands and asked to spend an afternoon with them
sharing the latest research on the treatment of traumatized children,
adolescents, and their families. The same is true for many of my colleagues.
These countries have already made a commitment to universal health care,
ensuring a guaranteed minimum wage, paid parental leave for both parents
after a child is born, and high-quality childcare for all working mothers.

Could this approach to public health have something to do with the fact
that the incarceration rate in Norway is 71/100,000, in the Netherlands
81/100,000, and the US 781/100,000, while the crime rate in those countries
is much lower than in ours, and the cost of medical care about half? Seventy
percent of prisoners in California spent time in foster care while growing
up. The United States spends $84 billion per year to incarcerate people at
approximately $44,000 per prisoner; the northern European countries a
fraction of that amount. Instead, they invest in helping parents to raise their
children in safe and predictable surroundings. Their academic test scores
and crime rates seem to reflect the success of those investments.

It is a strange thing that all the memories have these two qualities.
They are always full of quietness, that is the most striking thing
about them; and even when things weren’ t like that in reality , they
still seem to have that quality . They are soundless apparitions,
which speak to me by looks and gestures, wordless and silent—
and their silence is precisely what disturbs me.
—Erich Maria Remar que, All Quiet on the W estern Front
n the spring of 2002 I was asked to examine a young man who claimed to
have been sexually abused while he was growing up by Paul Shanley , a
Catholic priest who had served in his parish in Newton, Massachusetts.
Now twenty-five years old, he had apparently for gotten the abuse until he
heard that the priest  was currently under investigation for molesting young
boys . The question posed to me was: Even though he had seemingly
“repressed” the abuse for well over a decade after it ended, were his
memories credible, and was I prepared to testify to that fact before a judge?
I will share what this man, whom I’ll call Julian, told me, drawing on
my original case notes. (Even though his real name is in the public record,
I’m using a pseudonym because I hope that he has regained some privacy
and peace with the passage of time.1)

His experiences illustrate the complexities of traumatic memory . The
controversies over the case against Father Shanley are also typical of the
passions that have swirled around this issue since psychiatrists first
described the unusual nature of traumatic memories in the final decades of
the nineteenth century .
FLOODED BY SENSA TIONS AND IMAGES
On February 1 1, 2001, Julian was serving as a military policeman at an air
force base. During his daily phone conversation with his girlfriend, Rachel,
she  mentioned a lead article she’d read that morning in the Boston Globe.  A
priest named Shanley was under suspicion for molesting children. Hadn’ t
Julian once told her about a Father Shanley who had been his parish priest
back in Newton? “Did he ever do anything to you?” she asked. Julian
initially recalled Father Shanley as a kind man who’d been very supportive
after his parents got divorced. But as the conversation went on, he started to
go into a panic. He suddenly saw Shanley silhouetted in a doorframe, his
hands stretched out at forty-five degrees, staring at Julian as he urinated.
Overwhelmed by emotion, he told Rachel, “I’ve got to go.” He called his
flight chief, who came over accompanied by the first ser geant. After he met
with the two of them, they took him to the base chaplain. Julian recalls
telling him: “Do you know what is going on in Boston? It happened to me,
too.” The moment he heard himself say those words, he knew for certain
that Shanley had molested him—even though he did not remember the
details. Julian felt extremely embarrassed about being so emotional; he had
always been a strong kid who kept things to himself.
That night he sat on the corner of his bed, hunched over , thinking he
was losing his mind and terrified that he would be locked up. Over the
subsequent week images kept flooding into his mind, and he was afraid of
breaking down completely . He thought about taking a knife and plunging it
into his leg just to stop the mental pictures. Then the panic attacks started to
be accompanied by seizures, which he called “epileptic fits.”  He scratched
his body until he bled . He constantly felt hot, sweaty , and agitated.  Between
panic attacks he “felt like a zombie”; he was observing himself from a

distance, as if what he was experiencing were actually happening to
somebody else.
In April he received an administrative dischar ge, just ten days short of
being eligible to receive full benefits.
When Julian entered my of fice almost a year later , I saw a handsome,
muscular guy who looked depressed and defeated. He told me immediately
that he felt terrible about having left the air force. He had wanted to make it
his career , and he’d always received excellent evaluations. He loved the
challenges and the teamwork, and he missed the structure of the military
lifestyle.
Julian was born in a Boston suburb, the second-oldest of five children.
His father left the family when Julian was about six because he could not
tolerate living with Julian’ s emotionally labile mother . Julian and his father
get along quite well, but he sometimes reproaches his father for having
worked too hard to support his family and for abandoning him to the care of
his unbalanced mother . Neither his parents nor any of his siblings has ever
received psychiatric care or been involved with drugs.
Julian was a popular athlete in high school. Although he had many
friends, he felt pretty bad about himself and covered up for being a poor
student by drinking and partying. He feels ashamed that he took advantage
of his popularity and good looks by having sex with many girls. He
mentioned wanting to call several of them to apologize for how badly he’d
treated them.
He remembered always hating his body . In high school he took steroids
to pump himself up and smoked marijuana almost every day . He did not go
to college, and after graduating from high school he was virtually homeless
for almost a year because he could no longer stand living with his mother .
He enlisted to try to get his life back on track.
Julian met Father Shanley at age six when he was taking a CCD
(catechism) class at the parish church. He remembered Father Shanley
taking him out of the class for confession. Father Shanley rarely wore a
cassock, and Julian remembered the priest’ s dark blue corduroy pants. They
would go to a big room with one chair facing another and a  bench to kneel
on. The chairs were covered with red and there was a red velvet cushion on
the bench. They played cards, a game of war that turned into strip poker .
Then he remembered standing in front of a mirror in that room. Father

Shanley made him bend over . He remembered Father Shanley putting a
finger into his anus. He does not think Shanley ever penetrated him with his
penis, but he believes that the priest fingered him on numerous occasions.
Other than that, his memories were quite incoherent and fragmentary .
He had flashes of images of Shanley’ s face and of isolated incidents:
Shanley standing in the door of the bathroom; the priest going down on his
knees and moving “it” around with his tongue. He  could not say  how old he
was when that happened. He remembered the priest telling him how to
perform oral sex, but he did not remember actually doing it. He
remembered passing out pamphlets in church and then Father Shanley
sitting next to him in a pew , fondling him with one hand and holding
Julian’ s hand on himself with the other . He remembered that, as he grew
older , Father Shanley would pass close to him and caress his penis. Paul did
not like it but did not know what to do to stop it. After all, he told me,
“Father Shanley was the closest thing to God in my neighborhood.”
In addition to these memory fragments, traces of his sexual abuse were
clearly being activated and replayed. Sometimes when he was having sex
with his girlfriend, the priest’ s image popped into his head, and, as he said,
he would “lose it.” A week before I interviewed him, his girlfriend had
pushed a finger into his mouth and playfully said: “Y ou give good head.”
Julian jumped up and screamed, “If you ever say that again I’ll fucking kill
you.” Then, terrified, they both started to cry . This was followed by one of
Julian’ s “epileptic fits,” in which he curled up in a fetal position, shaking
and whimpering like a baby . While telling me this Julian looked very small
and very frightened.
Julian alternated between feeling sorry for the old man that Father
Shanley had become and simply wanting to “take him into a room
somewhere and kill him.” He also spoke repeatedly of how ashamed he felt,
how hard it was to admit that he could not protect himself: “Nobody fucks
with me, and now I have to tell you this.” His self-image was of a big,
tough Julian.
How do we make sense of a story like Julian’ s: years of apparent
for getting, followed by fragmented, disturbing images, dramatic physical
symptoms, and sudden reenactments? As a therapist treating people with a
legacy of trauma, my primary concern is not to determine exactly what
happened to them but to help them tolerate the sensations, emotions, and

reactions they experience without being constantly hijacked by them. When
the subject of blame arises, the central issue that needs to be addressed is
usually self-blame—accepting that the trauma was not their fault, that it
was not caused by some defect in themselves, and that no one could ever
have deserved what happened to them.
Once a legal case is involved, however , determination of culpability
becomes primary , and with it the admissibility of evidence. I had previously
examined twelve people who had been sadistically abused as children in a
Catholic orphanage in Burlington, V ermont. They had come forward (with
many other claimants) more than four decades later , and although none had
had any contact with the others until the first claim was filed, their abuse
memories were astonishingly similar: They all named the same names and
the particular abuses that each nun or priest had committed—in the same
rooms, with the same furniture, and as part of the same daily routines. Most
of them subsequently accepted an out-of-court settlement from the V ermont
diocese.
Before a case goes to trial, the judge holds a so-called Daubert hearing
to set the standards for expert testimony to be presented to the jury . In a
1996 case I had convinced a federal circuit court judge in Boston that it was
common for traumatized people to lose all memories of the event in
question, only to regain access to them in bits and pieces at a much later
date. The same standards would apply in Julian’ s case. While my report to
his lawyer remains confidential, it was based on decades of clinical
experience and research on traumatic memory , including the work of some
of the great pioneers of modern psychiatry .
NORMAL VERSUS TRAUMA TIC MEMOR Y
W e all know how fickle memory is; our stories change and are constantly
revised and updated. When my brothers, sisters, and I talk about events in
our childhood, we always end up feeling that we grew up in dif ferent
families—so many of our memories simply do not match. Such
autobiographical memories are not precise reflections of reality; they are
stories we tell to convey our personal take on our experience.

The extraordinary capacity of the human mind to rewrite memory is
illustrated in the Grant Study of Adult Development, which has
systematically followed the psychological and physical health of more than
two hundred Harvard men from their sophomore years of 1939–44 to the
present.2 Of course, the designers of the study could not have anticipated
that most of the participants would go of f to fight in W orld W ar II, but we
can now track the evolution of their wartime memories. The men were
interviewed in detail about their war experiences in 1945/1946 and again in
1989/1990. Four and a half decades later , the majority gave very dif ferent
accounts from the narratives recorded in their immediate postwar
interviews: W ith the passage of time, events had been bleached of their
intense horror . In contrast, those who had been traumatized and
subsequently developed PTSD did not modify their accounts; their
memories were preserved essentially intact forty-five years after the war
ended.
Whether we remember a particular event at all, and how accurate our
memories of it are, lar gely depends on how personally meaningful it was
and how emotional we felt about it at the time. The key factor is our level of
arousal. W e all have memories associated with particular people, songs,
smells, and places that stay with us for a long time. Most of us still have
precise memories of where we were and what we saw on T uesday ,
September 1 1, 2001, but only a fraction of us  recall anything in particular
about September 10.
Most day-to-day experience passes immediately into oblivion. On
ordinary days we don’ t have much to report when we come home in the
evening. The mind works according to schemes or maps, and incidents that
fall outside the established pattern are most likely to capture our attention.
If we get a raise or a friend tells us some exciting news, we will retain the
details of the moment, at least for a while. W e remember insults and injuries
best: The adrenaline that we secrete to defend against potential threats helps
to engrave those incidents into our minds. Even if the content of the remark
fades, our dislike for the person who made it usually persists.
When something terrifying happens, like seeing a child or a friend get
hurt in an accident, we will retain an intense and lar gely accurate memory
of the event for a long time. As James McGaugh and colleagues have

shown, the more adrenaline you secrete, the more precise your memory will
be.3 But that is true only up to a certain point. Confronted with horror—
especially the horror of “inescapable shock”—this system becomes
overwhelmed and breaks down.
Of course, we cannot monitor what happens during a traumatic
experience, but we can reactivate the trauma in the laboratory , as was done
for the brain scans in chapters 3 and 4. When memory traces of the original
sounds, images, and sensations are reactivated, the frontal lobe shuts down,
including, as we’ve seen, the region necessary to put feelings into words,4
the region that creates our sense of location in time, and the thalamus,
which integrates the raw data of incoming sensations. At this point the
emotional brain, which is not under conscious control and cannot
communicate in words, takes over . The emotional brain (the limbic area and
the brain stem) expresses its altered activation through changes in
emotional arousal, body physiology , and muscular action. Under ordinary
conditions these two memory systems—rational and emotional—
collaborate to produce an integrated response. But high arousal not only
changes the balance between them but also disconnects other brain areas
necessary for the proper storage and integration of incoming information,
such as the hippocampus and the thalamus.5 As a result, the imprints of
traumatic experiences are or ganized not as coherent logical narratives but in
fragmented sensory and emotional traces: images, sounds, and physical
sensations.6 Julian saw a man with outstretched arms, a pew , a staircase, a
strip poker game; he felt a sensation in his penis, a panicked sense of dread.
But there was little or no story .
UNCOVERING THE SECRETS OF TRAUMA
In the late nineteenth century , when medicine first began the systematic
study of mental problems, the nature of traumatic memory was one of the
central topics under discussion. In France and England a prodigious number
of articles were published on a syndrome known as “railway spine,” a
psychological aftermath of railroad accidents that included loss of memory .
The greatest advances, however , came in the study of hysteria, a mental
disorder characterized by emotional outbursts, susceptibility to suggestion,

and contractions and paralyses of the muscles that could not be explained
by simple anatomy .7 Once considered an af fliction of unstable or
malingering women (the name comes from the Greek word for “womb”),
hysteria now became a window into the mysteries of mind and body . The
names of some of the greatest pioneers in neurology and psychiatry , such as
Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Janet, and Sigmund Freud, are associated with
the discovery that trauma is at the root of hysteria, particularly the trauma
of childhood sexual abuse.8 These early researchers referred to traumatic
memories as “pathogenic secrets”9 or “mental parasites,”10 because as
much as the suf ferers wanted to for get whatever had happened, their
memories kept forcing themselves into consciousness, trapping them in an
ever -renewing present of existential horror .1 1
The interest in hysteria was particularly strong in France,  and, as so
often happens, its roots lay in the politics of the day . Jean-Martin Charcot,
who is widely regarded as the father of neurology and whose pupils, such as
Gilles de la T ourette, lent their names to numerous neurological diseases,
was also active in politics. After Emperor Napoleon III abdicated in 1870,
there was a struggle between the monarchists (the old order backed by the
cler gy), and the advocates of the fledgling French Republic, who believed
in science and in secular democracy . Charcot believed that women would be
a critical factor in this struggle, and his investigation of hysteria “of fered a
scientific explanation for phenomena such as demonic possession states,
witchcraft, exorcism, and religious ecstasy .”12
Charcot conducted meticulous studies of the physiological and
neurological correlates of hysteria in both men and women, all of which
emphasized embodied memory and a lack of language. For example,  in
1889 he published the case of a patient  named LeLog,  who developed
paralysis of the legs after being involved in a traf fic accident with a horse-
drawn cart. Although Lelog fell to the ground and lost consciousness, his
legs appeared unhurt, and there were no neurological signs that would
indicate a physical cause for his paralysis. Charcot discovered that just
before Lelog passed out, he saw the wheels of the cart approaching him and
strongly believed he would be run over . He noted that “the patient . . . does
not preserve any recollection. . . . Questions addressed to him upon this
point are attended with no result. He knows nothing or almost nothing.”13

Like many other patients at the Salpêtrière, Lelog expressed his experience
physically: Instead of remembering the accident, he developed paralysis of
his legs.14
P AINTING BY ANDRE BROUILLET
Jean-Martin Char cot pr esents the case of a patient with hysteria.  Charcot transformed La
Salpêtrière, an ancient asylum for the poor of Paris, which he transformed into a modern
hospital. Notice the patient’ s dramatic posture.
But for me the real hero of this story is Pierre Janet, who helped
Charcot establish a research laboratory devoted to the study of hysteria at
the Salpêtrière. In 1889, the same year that the Eif fel T ower was built, Janet
published the first book-length scientific account of traumatic stress:
L ’automatisme psychologique .15 Janet proposed that at the root of what we
now call PTSD was the experience of “vehement emotions,” or intense
emotional arousal. This treatise explained that, after having been
traumatized, people automatically keep repeating certain actions, emotions,
and sensations related to the trauma.  And unlike Charcot, who was

primarily interested in measuring and documenting patients’ physical
symptoms, Janet spent untold hours talking with them, trying to discover
what was going on in their minds. Also in contrast to Charcot, whose
research focused on understanding the phenomenon of hysteria, Janet was
first and foremost a clinician whose goal was to treat his patients. That is
why I studied his case reports in detail and why he became one of my most
important teachers.16
AMNESIA, DISSOCIA TION, AND REENACTMENT
Janet was the first to point out the dif ference between “narrative
memory”—the stories people tell about trauma—and traumatic memory
itself. One of his case histories was the story of Irène, a young woman who
was hospitalized following her mother ’ s death from tuberculosis.17 Irène
had nursed her mother for many months while continuing to work outside
the home to support her alcoholic father and pay for her mother ’ s medical
care. When her mother finally died, Irène—exhausted from stress and lack
of sleep—tried for several hours to revive the corpse, calling out to her
mother and trying to force medicine down her throat. At one point the
lifeless body dropped of f the bed while Irène’ s drunken father lay passed
out nearby . Even after an aunt arrived and started preparing for the burial,
Irène’ s denial persisted. She had to be persuaded to attend the funeral, and
she laughed throughout the service. A few weeks later she was brought to
the Salpêtrière, where Janet took over her case.
In addition to amnesia for her mother ’ s death, Irène suf fered from
another symptom: Several times a week she would stare, trancelike, at an
empty bed, ignore whatever was going on around her , and begin to care for
an imaginary person. She meticulously reproduced, rather than
remembered, the details of her mother ’ s death.
T raumatized people simultaneously remember too little and too much.
On the one hand, Irène had no conscious memory of her mother ’ s death—
she could not tell the story of what had happened. On the other she was
compelled to physically act out the events of her mother ’ s death. Janet’ s
term “automatism” conveys the involuntary , unconscious nature of her
actions.

Janet treated Irène for several months, mainly with hypnosis. At the
end he asked her again about her mother ’ s death. Irène started to cry and
said, “Don’ t remind me of those terrible things. . . . My mother was dead
and my father was a complete drunk, as always. I had to take care of her
dead body all night long. I did a lot of silly things in order to revive her . . . .
In the morning I lost my mind.” Not only was Irène able tell the story , but
she had also recovered her emotions: “I feel very sad and abandoned.” Janet
now called her memory “complete” because it now was accompanied by the
appropriate feelings.
Janet noted significant dif ferences between ordinary and traumatic
memory . T raumatic memories are precipitated by specific triggers. In
Julian’ s case the trigger was his girlfriend’ s seductive comments; in Irène’ s
it was a bed. When one element of a traumatic experience is triggered, other
elements are likely to automatically follow .
T raumatic memory is not condensed: It took Irène three to four hours to
reenact her story , but when she was finally able to tell what had happened it
took  less than a minute. The traumatic enactment serves no function. In
contrast, ordinary memory is adaptive; our stories are flexible and can be
modified to fit the circumstances. Ordinary memory is essentially social;
it’ s a story that we tell for a purpose: in Irène’ s case, to enlist her doctor ’ s
help and comfort; in Julian’ s case, to recruit me to join his search for justice
and revenge. But there is nothing social about traumatic memory . Julian’ s
rage at his girlfriend’ s remark served no useful purpose. Reenactments are
frozen in time, unchanging, and they are always lonely , humiliating, and
alienating experiences.
Janet coined the term “dissociation” to describe the splitting of f and
isolation of memory imprints that he saw in his patients. He was also
prescient about the heavy cost of keeping these traumatic memories at bay .
He later wrote that when patients dissociate their traumatic experience, they
become  “attached to an insurmountable obstacle”:18 “[U]nable to integrate
their traumatic memories, they seem to lose their capacity to assimilate new
experiences as well. It is . . . as if their personality has definitely stopped at
a certain point, and cannot enlar ge any more by the addition or assimilation
of new elements.”19 He predicted that unless they became aware of the
split-of f elements and integrated them into a story that had happened in the

past but was now over , they would experience a slow decline in their
personal and professional functioning. This phenomenon has now been well
documented in contemporary research.20
Janet discovered that, while it is normal to change and distort one’ s
memories, people with PTSD are unable to put the actual event, the source
of those memories, behind them .  Dissociation prevents the trauma from
becoming integrated within the conglomerated, ever -shifting stores of
autobiographical memory , in essence creating a dual memory system.
Normal memory integrates the elements of each experience into the
continuous flow of self-experience by a complex process of association;
think of a dense but flexible network where each element exerts a subtle
influence on many others. But in Julian’ s case, the sensations, thoughts, and
emotions of the trauma were stored separately as frozen, barely
comprehensible fragments. If the problem with PTSD is dissociation , the
goal of treatment would be association : integrating the cut-of f elements of
the trauma into the ongoing narrative of life, so that the brain can recognize
that “that was then, and this is now .”
THE ORIGINS OF THE “T ALKING CURE”
Psychoanalysis was born on the wards of the Salpêtrière. In 1885 Freud
went to Paris to work with Charcot, and he later named his firstborn son
Jean-Martin in Charcot’ s honor . In 1893 Freud and his V iennese mentor ,
Josef Breuer , cited both Charcot and Janet in a brilliant paper on the cause
of hysteria. “ Hysterics suffer mainly fr om r eminiscences,”  they proclaim,
and go on to note that these memories are not subject to the “wearing away
process” of normal memories but “persist for a long time with astonishing
freshness.” Nor can traumatized people control when they will emer ge: “W e
must . . . mention another remarkable fact . . . namely , that these memories,
unlike other memories of their past lives, are not at the patients’ disposal.
On the contrary , these experiences ar e completely absent fr om the patients’
memory when they ar e in a normal psychical state, or ar e only pr esent in a
highly summary form. ”21 (All italics in the quoted passages are Breuer and
Freud’ s.)

Breuer and Freud believed that traumatic memories were lost to
ordinary consciousness either because “circumstances made a reaction
impossible,” or because they started during “severely paralyzing af fects,
such as fright.” In 1896 Freud boldly claimed that “the ultimate cause of
hysteria is always the seduction of the child by an adult.”22 Then, faced
with his own evidence of an epidemic of abuse in the best families of
V ienna—one, he noted, that would implicate his own father—he quickly
began to retreat. Psychoanalysis shifted to an emphasis on unconscious
wishes and fantasies, though Freud occasionally kept acknowledging the
reality of sexual abuse.23 After the horrors of W orld W ar I confronted him
with the reality of combat neuroses, Freud reaf firmed that lack of verbal
memory is central in trauma and that, if a person does not remember , he is
likely to act out: “[H]e reproduces it not as a memory but as an action; he
repeats it, without knowing, of course, that he is repeating, and in the end,
we understand that this is his way of remembering.”24
The lasting legacy of Breuer and Freud’ s 1893 paper is what we now
call the “talking cure”:  “ [W]e  found, to our great surprise, at first, that  each
individual hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappear ed
when we had succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event
by which it was pr ovoked and in ar ousing its accompanying affect, and
when the patient had described that event in the gr eatest possible detail and
had put the affect into wor ds  (all italics in original). Recollection without
af fect almost invariably produces no result. ”
They explain that unless there is an “ener getic reaction” to the
traumatic event, the af fect “remains attached to the memory” and cannot be
dischar ged. The reaction can be dischar ged by an action—“from tears to
acts of revenge.” “But language serves as a substitute for action; by its help,
an af fect can be ‘abreacted’ almost as ef fectively .” “It will now be
understood,” they conclude, “how it is that the psychotherapeutic procedure
which we have described in these pages has a curative ef fect. It brings to an
end the operative for ce . . . which was not abr eacted in the first instance
[i.e., at the time of the trauma] , by allowing its strangulated affect to find a
way out thr ough speech; and it subjects it to associative corr ection by
intr oducing it into normal consciousness.”

Even though psychoanalysis is today in eclipse, the “talking cure” has
lived on, and psychologists have generally assumed that telling the trauma
story in great detail will help people to leave it behind. That is also a basic
premise of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which today is taught in
graduate psychology courses around the world.
Although the diagnostic labels have changed, we continue to see
patients similar to those described by Charcot, Janet, and Freud. In 1986 my
colleagues and I wrote up the case of a woman who had been a cigarette girl
at Boston’ s Cocoanut Grove nightclub when it burned down in 1942.25
During the 1970s and 1980s she annually reenacted her escape on Newbury
Street, a few blocks from the original location, which resulted in her being
hospitalized with diagnoses like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . In 1989
I reported on a V ietnam veteran who yearly staged an “armed robbery” on
the exact anniversary of a buddy’ s death.26 He would put a finger in his
pants pocket, claim that it was a pistol, and tell a shopkeeper to empty his
cash register—giving him plenty of time to alert the police. This
unconscious attempt to commit “suicide by cop” came to an end after a
judge referred the veteran to me for treatment. Once we had dealt with his
guilt about his friend’ s death, there were no further reenactments.
Such incidents raise a critical question: How can doctors, police
of ficers, or social workers recognize that someone is suf fering from
traumatic stress as long as he reenacts rather than remember? How can
patients themselves identify the source of their behavior? If their history is
not known, they are likely to be labeled as crazy or punished as criminals
rather than helped to integrate the past.
TRAUMA TIC MEMOR Y ON TRIAL
At least two dozen men had claimed they were molested by Paul Shanley ,
and many of them reached civil settlements with the Boston archdiocese.
Julian was the only victim who was called to testify in Shanley’ s trial. In
February 2005 the former priest was found guilty on two counts of raping a
child and two counts of assault and battery on a child. He was sentenced to
twelve to fifteen years in prison.

In 2007 Shanley’ s attorney , Robert F . Shaw Jr ., filed a motion for a new
trial, challenging Shanley’ s convictions as a miscarriage of justice. Shaw
tried to make the case that “repressed memories” were not generally
accepted in the scientific community , that the convictions were based on
“junk science,” and that there had been insuf ficient testimony about the
scientific status of repressed memories before the trial. The appeal was
rejected by the original trial judge but two years later was taken up by the
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Almost one hundred leading
psychiatrists and psychologists from around the United States and eight
foreign countries signed an amicus curiae brief stating that “repressed
memory” has never been shown to exist and that it should not have been
admitted as evidence. However , on January 10, 2010, the court
unanimously upheld Shanley’ s conviction with this statement: “In sum, the
judge’ s finding that the lack of scientific testing did not make unreliable the
theory that an individual may experience dissociative amnesia was
supported in the record. . . . There was no abuse of discretion in the
admission of expert testimony on the subject of dissociative amnesia.”
In the following chapter I’ll talk more about memory and for getting
and about how the debate over repressed memory , which started with Freud,
continues to be played out today .

Our bodies are the texts that carry the memories and therefore
remembering is no less than reincarnation.
—Katie Cannon
cientific interest in trauma has fluctuated wildly during the past 150
years. Charcot’ s death in 1893 and Freud’ s shift in emphasis to inner
conflicts, defenses, and instincts at the root of mental suf fering were just
part of mainstream medicine’ s overall loss of interest in the subject.
Psychoanalysis rapidly gained in popularity . In 191 1 the Boston psychiatrist
Morton Prince, who had studied with W illiam James and Pierre Janet,
complained that those interested in the ef fects of trauma were like “clams
swamped by the rising tide in Boston Harbor .”
This neglect lasted for only a few years, though, because the outbreak
of W orld W ar in 1914 once again confronted medicine and psychology with
hundreds of thousands of men with bizarre psychological symptoms,
unexplained medical conditions, and memory loss. The new technology of
motion pictures made it possible to film these soldiers, and today on
Y ouT ube we can observe their bizarre physical postures, strange verbal
utterances, terrified facial expressions, and tics—the physical, embodied
expression of trauma: “a memory that is inscribed simultaneously in the
mind, as interior images and words, and on the body .”1

Early in the war the British created the diagnosis of “shell shock,”
which entitled combat veterans to treatment and a disability pension. The
alternative, similar , diagnosis was “neurasthenia,” for which they received
neither treatment nor a pension. It was up to the orientation of the treating
physician which diagnosis a soldier received.2
More than a million British soldiers served on the W estern Front at any
one time. In the first few hours of July 1, 1916 alone, in the Battle of the
Somme, the British army suf fered 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead,
the bloodiest day in its history . The historian John Keegan says of their
commander , Field Marshal Douglas Haig, whose statue today dominates
Whitehall in London, once the center of the British Empire: “In his public
manner and private diaries no concern for human suf fering was or is
discernible.” At the Somme “he had sent the flower of British youth to
death or mutilation.”3
As the war wore on, shell shock increasingly compromised the
ef ficiency of the fighting forces. Caught between taking the suf fering of
their soldiers seriously and pursuing victory over the Germans, the British
General Staf f issued General Routine Order Number 2384 in June of 1917,
which stated, “In no circumstances whatever will the expression ‘shell
shock’ be used verbally or be recorded in any regimental or other casualty
report, or any hospital or other medical document.” All soldiers with
psychiatric problems were to be given a single diagnosis of “NYDN” (Not
Y et Diagnosed, Nervous).4 In November 1917 the General Staf f denied
Charles Samuel Myers, who ran four field hospitals for wounded soldiers,
permission to submit a paper on shell shock to the British Medical Journal .
The Germans were even more punitive and treated shell shock as a
character defect, which they managed with a variety of painful treatments,
including electroshock.
In 1922 the British government issued the Southborough Report, whose
goal was to prevent the diagnosis of shell shock in any future wars and to
undermine any more claims for compensation. It suggested the elimination
of shell shock from all of ficial nomenclature and insisted that these cases
should no more be classified “as a battle casualty than sickness or disease is
so regarded.”5 The of ficial view was that well-trained troops, properly led,
would not suf fer from shell shock and that the servicemen who had

succumbed to the disorder were undisciplined and unwilling soldiers. While
the political storm about the legitimacy of shell shock continued to rage for
several more years, reports on how to best treat these cases disappeared
from the scientific literature.6
In the United States the fate of veterans was also fraught with
problems. In 1918, when they returned home from the battlefields of France
and Flanders, they had been welcomed as national heroes, just as the
soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are today . In 1924 Congress
voted to award them a bonus of $1.25 for each day they had served
overseas, but disbursement was postponed until 1945.
By 1932 the nation was in the middle of the Great Depression, and in
May of that year about fifteen thousand unemployed and penniless veterans
camped on the Mall in W ashington DC to petition for immediate payment
of their bonuses. The Senate defeated the bill to move up disbursement by a
vote of sixty-two to eighteen. A month later President Hoover ordered the
army to clear out the veterans’ encampment. Army chief of staf f General
Douglas MacArthur commanded the troops, supported by six tanks. Major
Dwight D. Eisenhower was the liaison with the W ashington police, and
Major Geor ge Patton was in char ge of the cavalry . Soldiers with fixed
bayonets char ged, hurling tear gas into the crowd of veterans. The next
morning the Mall was deserted and the camp was in flames.7 The veterans
never received their pensions.
While politics and medicine turned their backs on the returning
soldiers, the horrors of the war were memorialized in literature and art. In
All Quiet on the W estern Fr ont,8 a novel about the war experiences of
frontline soldiers by the German writer Erich Maria Remarque, the book’ s
protagonist, Paul Bäumer , spoke for an entire generation: “I am aware that
I, without realizing it, have lost my feelings—I don’ t belong here anymore,
I live in an alien world. I prefer to be left alone, not disturbed by anybody .
They talk too much—I can’ t relate to them—they are only busy with
superficial things.”9 Published in 1929, the novel instantly became an
international best seller , with translations in twenty-five languages. The
1930 Hollywood film version won the Academy A ward for Best Picture.
But when Hitler came to power a few years later , All Quiet on the
W estern Fr ont  was one of the first “degenerate” books the Nazis burned in

the public square in front of Humboldt University in Berlin.10 Apparently
awareness of the devastating ef fects of war on soldiers’ minds would have
constituted a threat to the Nazis’ plunge into another round of insanity .
Denial of the consequences of trauma can wreak havoc with the social
fabric of society . The refusal to face the damage caused by the war and the
intolerance of “weakness” played an important role in the rise of fascism
and militarism around the world in the 1930s. The extortionate war
reparations of the T reaty of V ersailles further humiliated an already
disgraced Germany . German society , in turn, dealt ruthlessly with its own
traumatized war veterans, who were treated as inferior creatures. This
cascade of humiliations of the powerless set the stage for the ultimate
debasement of human rights under the Nazi regime: the moral justification
for the strong to vanquish the inferior—the rationale for the ensuing war .
THE NEW F ACE OF TRAUMA
The outbreak of W orld W ar II prompted Charles Samuel Myers and the
American psychiatrist Abram Kardiner to publish the accounts of their
work with W orld W ar I soldiers and veterans. Shell Shock in France 1914–
1918 (1940)1 1 and The  T raumatic Neur oses of W ar  (1941)12 served as the
principal guides for psychiatrists who were treating soldiers in the new
conflict who had “war neuroses.” The U.S. war ef fort was prodigious, and
the advances in frontline psychiatry reflected that commitment. Again,
Y ouT ube of fers a direct window on the past: Hollywood director John
Huston’ s documentary Let Ther e Be Light  (1946) shows the predominant
treatment for war neuroses at that time: hypnosis.13
In Huston’ s film, made while he was serving in the Army Signal Corps,
the doctors are still patriarchal and the patients are still terrified young men.
But they manifest their trauma dif ferently: While the W orld W ar I soldiers
flail, have facial tics, and collapse with paralyzed bodies, the following
generation talks and cringes. Their bodies still keep the score: Their
stomachs are upset, their hearts race, and they are overwhelmed by panic.
But the trauma did not just af fect their bodies. The trance state induced by
hypnosis allowed them to find words for the things they had been too afraid
to remember: their terror , their survivor ’ s guilt, and their conflicting

loyalties. It also struck me that these soldiers seemed to keep a much tighter
lid on their anger and hostility than the younger veterans I’d worked with.
Culture shapes the expression of traumatic stress.
The feminist theorist Germaine Greer wrote about the treatment of her
father ’ s PTSD after W orld W ar II: “When [the medical of ficers] examined
men exhibiting severe disturbances they almost invariably found the root
cause in pre-war experience: the sick men were not first-grade fighting
material. . . . The military proposition is [that it is] not war which makes
men sick, but that sick men can not fight wars.”14 It seems unlikely the
doctors did her father any good, but Greer ’ s ef forts to come to grips with
his suf fering undoubtedly helped fuel her exploration of sexual domination
in all its ugly manifestations of rape, incest, and domestic violence.
When I worked at the V A, I was puzzled that the vast majority of the
patients we saw on the psychiatry service were young, recently dischar ged
V ietnam veterans, while the corridors and elevators that led to the medical
departments were filled by old men. Curious about this disparity , I
conducted a survey of the W orld W ar II veterans in the medical clinics in
1983. The vast majority of them scored positive for PTSD on the rating
scales that I administered, but their treatment focused on medical rather
than psychiatric complaints. These vets communicated their distress via
stomach cramps and chest pains rather than with nightmares and rage, from
which, my research showed, they also suf fered. Doctors shape how their
patients communicate their distress: When a patient complains about
terrifying nightmares and his doctor orders a chest X-ray , the patient
realizes that he’ll get better care if he focuses on his physical problems.
Like my relatives who fought in or were captured during W orld W ar II,
most of these men were extremely reluctant to share their experiences. My
sense was that neither the doctors nor their patients wanted to revisit the
war .
However , military and civilian leaders came away from W orld W ar II
with important lessons that the previous generation had failed to grasp.
After the defeat of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, the United States
helped rebuild Europe by means of the Marshall Plan, which formed the
economic foundation of the next fifty years of relative peace. At home, the
GI Bill provided millions of veterans with educations and home mortgages,

which promoted general economic well-being and created a broad-based,
well-educated middle class. The armed forces led the nation in racial
integration and opportunity . The V eterans Administration built facilities
nationwide to help combat veterans with their health care. Still, with all this
thoughtful attention to the returning veterans, the psychological scars of war
went unrecognized, and traumatic neuroses disappeared entirely from
of ficial psychiatric nomenclature. The last scientific writing on combat
trauma after W orld W ar II appeared in 1947.15
TRAUMA REDISCOVERED
As I noted earlier , when I started to work with V ietnam veterans, there was
not a single book on war trauma in the library of the V A, but the V ietnam
W ar inspired numerous studies, the formation of scholarly or ganizations,
and the inclusion of a trauma diagnosis, PTSD, in the professional
literature. At the same time, interest in trauma was exploding in the general
public.
In 1974 Freedman and Kaplan’ s Compr ehensive T extbook of Psychiatry
stated that “incest is extremely rare, and does not occur in more than 1 out
of 1.1 million people.”16 As we have seen in chapter 2 this authoritative
textbook then went on to extol the possible benefits of incest: “Such
incestuous activity diminishes the subject’ s chance of psychosis and allows
for a better adjustment to the external world. . . . The vast majority of them
were none the worse for the experience.”
How misguided those statements were became obvious when the
ascendant feminist movement, combined with awareness of trauma in
returning combat veterans, emboldened tens of thousands of survivors of
childhood sexual abuse, domestic abuse, and rape to come forward.
Consciousness-raising groups and survivor groups were formed, and
numerous popular books, including The Courage to Heal  (1988), a best-
selling self-help book for survivors of incest, and Judith Herman’ s book
T rauma and Recovery (1992), discussed the stages of treatment and
recovery in great detail.
Cautioned by history , I began to wonder if we were headed toward
another backlash like those of 1895, 1917, and 1947 against acknowledging

the reality of trauma. That proved to be the case, for by the early 1990s
articles had started to appear in many leading newspapers and magazines in
United States and in Europe about a so-called False Memory Syndrome in
which psychiatric patients supposedly manufactured elaborate false
memories of sexual abuse, which they then claimed had lain dormant for
many years before being recovered.
What was striking about these articles was the certainty with which
they stated that there was no evidence that people remember trauma any
dif ferently than they do ordinary events. I vividly recall a phone call from a
well-known newsweekly in London, telling me that they planned to publish
an article about traumatic memory in their next issue and asking me
whether I had any comments on the subject. I was quite enthusiastic about
their question and told them that memory loss for traumatic events had first
been studied in England well over a century earlier . I mentioned John Eric
Erichsen and Frederic Myers’ s work on railway accidents in the 1860s and
1870s and Charles Samuel Myers’ s and W . H. R. Rivers’ s extensive studies
of memory problems in combat soldiers of W orld W ar I. I also suggested
they look at an article published in The Lancet  in 1944, which described the
aftermath of the rescue of the entire British army from the beaches of
Dunkirk in 1940. More than 10 percent of the soldiers who were studied
had suf fered from major memory loss after the evacuation.17 The following
week, the magazine  told its readers that there was no evidence whatsoever
that people sometimes lose some or all memory for traumatic events.
The issue of delayed recall of trauma was not particularly controversial
when Myers and Kardiner first described this phenomenon in their books on
combat neuroses in W orld W ar I; when major memory loss was observed
after the evacuation from Dunkirk; or when I wrote about V ietnam veterans
and the survivor of the Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire. However , during the
1980s and early 1990s, as similar memory problems began to be
documented in women and children in the context of domestic abuse, the
ef forts of abuse victims to seek justice against their alleged perpetrators
moved the issue from science into politics and law . This, in turn, became
the context for the pedophile scandals in the Catholic Church, in which
memory experts were pitted against one another in courtrooms across the
United States and later in Europe and Australia.

Experts testifying on behalf of the Church claimed that memories of
childhood sexual abuse were unreliable at best and that the claims being
made by alleged victims more likely resulted from false memories
implanted in their minds by therapists who were oversympathetic,
credulous, or driven by their own agendas. During this period I examined
more than fifty adults who, like Julian, remembered having been abused by
priests. Their claims were denied in about half the cases.
THE SCIENCE OF REPRESSED MEMOR Y
There have in fact been hundreds of scientific publications spanning well
over a century documenting how the memory of trauma can be repressed,
only to resurface years or decades later .18 Memory loss has been reported in
people who have experienced natural disasters, accidents, war trauma,
kidnapping, torture, concentration camps, and physical and sexual abuse.
T otal memory loss is most common in childhood sexual abuse, with
incidence ranging from 19 percent to 38 percent.19 This issue is not
particularly controversial: As early as 1980 the DSM-III recognized the
existence of memory loss for traumatic events in the diagnostic criteria for
dissociative amnesia: “an inability to recall important personal information,
usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be
explained by normal for getfulness.”  Memory loss has been part of the
criteria for PTSD since that diagnosis was first introduced.
One of the most interesting studies of repressed memory was conducted
by Dr . Linda Meyer W illiams, which began when she was a graduate
student in sociology  at the University of Pennsylvania in the early 1970s.
W illiams interviewed 206 girls between the ages of ten and twelve who had
been admitted to a hospital emer gency room following sexual abuse. Their
laboratory tests, as well as the interviews with the children and their
parents, were kept in the hospital’ s medical records. Seventeen years later
W illiams was able to track down 136 of the children, now adults, with
whom she conducted extensive follow-up interviews.20 More than a third of
the women (38 percent) did not recall the abuse that was documented in
their medical records, while only fifteen women (12 percent) said that they
had never been abused as children. More than two-thirds (68 percent)

reported other incidents of childhood sexual abuse. W omen who were
younger at the time of the incident and those who were molested by
someone they knew were more likely to have for gotten their abuse.
This study also examined the reliability of recovered memories. One in
ten women (16 percent of those who recalled the abuse) reported that they
had for gotten it at some time in the past but later remembered that it had
happened. In comparison with the women who had always remembered
their molestation, those with a prior period of for getting were younger at the
time of their abuse and were less likely to have received support from their
mothers. W illiams also determined that the recovered memories were
approximately as accurate as those that had never been lost: All the
women’ s memories were accurate for the central facts of the incident, but
none of their stories precisely matched every detail documented in their
charts.21
W illiams’ s findings are supported by recent neuroscience research that
shows that memories that are retrieved tend to return to the memory bank
with modifications.22 As long as a memory is inaccessible, the mind is
unable to change it. But as soon as a story starts being told, particularly if it
is told repeatedly , it changes—the act of telling itself changes the tale. The
mind cannot help but make meaning out of what it knows, and the meaning
we make of our lives changes how and what we remember .
Given the wealth of evidence that trauma can be for gotten and
resurface years later , why did nearly one hundred reputable memory
scientists from several dif ferent countries throw the weight of their
reputations behind the appeal to overturn Father Shanley’ s conviction,
claiming that “repressed memories” were based on “junk science”? Because
memory loss and delayed recall of traumatic experiences had never been
documented in the laboratory , some cognitive scientists adamantly denied
that these phenomena existed23 or that retrieved traumatic memories could
be accurate.24 However , what doctors encounter in emer gency rooms, on
psychiatric wards, and on the battlefield is necessarily quite dif ferent from
what scientists observe in their safe and well-or ganized laboratories.
Consider what is known as the “lost in the mall” experiment, for
example. Academic researchers have shown that it is relatively easy to
implant memories of events that never took place, such as having been lost

in a shopping mall as a child.25 About 25 percent of subjects in these
studies later “recall” that they were frightened and even fill in missing
details. But such recollections involve none of the visceral terror that a lost
child would actually experience.
Another line of research documented the unreliability of eyewitness
testimony . Subjects might be shown a video of a car driving down a street
and asked afterward if they saw a stop sign or a traf fic light; children might
be asked to recall what a male visitor to their classroom had been wearing.
Other eyewitness experiments demonstrated that the questions witnesses
were asked could alter what they claimed to remember . These studies were
valuable in bringing many police and courtroom practices into question, but
they have little relevance to traumatic memory .
The fundamental problem is this: Events that take place in the
laboratory cannot be considered equivalent to the conditions under which
traumatic memories are created. The terror and helplessness associated with
PTSD simply can’ t be induced de novo  in such a setting. W e can study the
ef fects of existing traumas in the lab, as in our script-driven imaging studies
of flashbacks, but the original imprint of trauma cannot be laid down there.
Dr . Roger Pitman conducted a study at Harvard in which he showed college
students a film called Faces of Death , which contained newsreel footage of
violent deaths and executions. This movie, now widely banned, is as
extreme as any institutional review board would allow , but it did not cause
Pitman’ s normal volunteers to develop symptoms of PTSD. If you want to
study traumatic memory , you have to study the memories of people who
have actually been traumatized.
Interestingly , once the excitement and profitability of courtroom
testimony  diminished, the “scientific” controversy disappeared as well,  and
clinicians were left to deal with the wreckage of traumatic memory .
NORMAL VERSUS TRAUMA TIC MEMOR Y
In 1994 I and my colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital decided to
undertake a systematic study comparing how people recall benign
experiences and horrific ones. W e placed advertisements in local
newspapers, in laundromats, and on student union bulletin boards that said:

“Has something terrible happened to you that you cannot get out of your
mind? Call 727-5500; we will pay you $10.00 for participating in this
study .” In response to our first ad seventy-six volunteers showed up.26
After we introduced ourselves, we started of f by asking each
participant: “Can you tell us about an event in your life that you think you
will always remember but that is not traumatic?” One participant lit up and
said, “The day that my daughter was born”; others mentioned their wedding
day , playing on a winning sports team, or being valedictorian at their high
school graduation. Then we asked them to focus on specific sensory details
of those events, such as: “Are you ever somewhere and suddenly have a
vivid image of what your husband looked like on your wedding day?” The
answers were always negative. “How about what your husband’ s body felt
like on your wedding night?” (W e got some odd looks on that one.) W e
continued: “Do you ever have a vivid, precise recollection of the speech
you gave as a valedictorian?” “Do you ever have intense sensations
recalling the birth of your first child?” The replies were all in the negative.
Then we asked them about the traumas that had brought them into the
study—many of them rapes. “Do you ever suddenly remember how your
rapist smelled?” we asked, and, “Do you ever experience the same physical
sensations you had when you were raped?” Such questions precipitated
powerful emotional responses: “That is why I cannot go to parties anymore,
because the smell of alcohol on somebody’ s breath makes me feel like I am
being raped all over again” or “I can no longer make love to my husband,
because when he touches me in a particular way I feel like I am being raped
again.”
There were two major dif ferences between how people talked about
memories of positive versus traumatic experiences: (1) how the memories
were or ganized, and (2) their physical reactions to them. W eddings, births,
and graduations were recalled as events from the past, stories with a
beginning, a middle, and an end. Nobody said that there were periods when
they’d completely for gotten any of these events.
In contrast, the traumatic memories were disor ganized. Our subjects
remembered some details all too clearly (the smell of the rapist, the gash in
the forehead of a dead child) but could not recall the sequence of events or

other vital details (the first person who arrived to help, whether an
ambulance or a police car took them to the hospital).
W e also asked the participants how they recalled their trauma at three
points in time: right after it happened; when they were most troubled by
their symptoms; and during the week before the study .  All of our
traumatized participants said that they had not been able to tell anybody
precisely what had happened immediately following the event. (This will
not surprise anyone who has worked in an emer gency room or ambulance
service: People brought in after a car accident in which a child or a friend
has been killed sit in stunned silence, dumbfounded by terror .) Almost all
had repeated flashbacks: They felt overwhelmed by images, sounds,
sensations, and emotions. As time went on, even more sensory details and
feelings were activated, but most participants also started to be able to make
some sense out of them. They began to “know” what had happened and to
be able to tell the story to other people, a story that we call “the memory of
the trauma.”
Gradually the images and flashbacks decreased in frequency , but the
greatest improvement was in the participants’ ability to piece together the
details and sequence of the event. By the time of our study , 85 percent of
them were able to tell a coherent story , with a beginning, a middle, and an
end. Only a few were missing significant details. W e noted that the five
who said they had been abused as children had the most fragmented
narratives—their memories still arrived as images, physical sensations, and
intense emotions.
In essence, our study confirmed the dual memory system that Janet and
his colleagues at the Salpêtrière had described more than a hundred years
earlier: T raumatic memories are fundamentally dif ferent from the stories we
tell about the past. They are dissociated: The dif ferent sensations that
entered the brain at the time of the trauma are not properly assembled into a
story , a piece of autobiography .
Perhaps the most important finding in our study was that remembering
the trauma with all its associated af fects, does not, as Breuer and Freud
claimed back in 1893, necessarily resolve it. Our research did not support
the idea that language can substitute for action. Most of our study
participants could tell a coherent story and also experience the pain
associated with those stories, but they kept being haunted by unbearable

images and physical sensations. Research in contemporary exposure
treatment, a staple of cognitive behavioral therapy , has similarly
disappointing results: The majority of patients treated with that method
continue to have serious PTSD symptoms three months after the end of
treatment.27 As we will see, finding words to describe what has happened to
you can be transformative, but it does not always abolish flashbacks or
improve concentration, stimulate vital involvement in your life or reduce
hypersensitivity to disappointments and perceived injuries.
LISTENING T O SUR VIV ORS
Nobody wants to remember trauma. In that regard society is no dif ferent
from the victims themselves. W e all want to live in a world that is safe,
manageable, and predictable, and victims remind us that this is not always
the case. In order to understand trauma, we have to overcome our natural
reluctance to confront that reality and cultivate the courage to listen to the
testimonies of survivors.
In his book Holocaust T estimonies: The Ruins of Memory  (1991),
Lawrence Langer writes about his work in the Fortunof f V ideo Archive at
Y ale University: “Listening to accounts of Holocaust experience, we
unearth a mosaic of evidence that constantly vanishes into bottomless layers
of incompletion.28 W e wrestle with the beginnings of a permanently
unfinished tale, full of incomplete intervals, faced by the spectacle of a
faltering witness often reduced to a distressed silence by the overwhelming
solicitations of deep memory .” As one of his witnesses says: “If you were
not there, it’ s dif ficult to describe and say how it was. How men function
under such stress is one thing, and then how you communicate and express
that to somebody who never knew that such a degree of brutality exists
seems like a fantasy .”
Another survivor , Charlotte Delbo, describes her dual existence after
Auschwitz: “[T]he ‘self ’ who was in the camp isn’ t me, isn’ t the person
who is here, opposite you. No, it’ s too unbelievable. And everything that
happened to this other ‘self,’ the one from Auschwitz, doesn’ t touch me
now , me , doesn’ t concern me, so distinct are deep memory and common
memory . . . . W ithout this split, I wouldn’ t have been able to come back to

life.”29 She comments that even words have a dual meaning: “Otherwise,
someone [in the camps] who has been tormented by thirst for weeks would
never again be able to say: ‘I’m thirsty . Let’ s make a cup of tea.’ Thirst
[after the war] has once more become a currently used term. On the other
hand, if I dream of the thirst I felt in Birkenau [the extermination facilities
in Auschwitz], I see myself as I was then, haggard, bereft of reason,
tottering.”30
Langer hauntingly concludes, “Who can find a proper grave for such
damaged mosaics of the mind, where they may rest in pieces? Life goes on,
but in two temporal directions at once, the future unable to escape the grip
of a memory laden with grief.”31
The essence of trauma is that it is overwhelming, unbelievable, and
unbearable. Each patient demands that we suspend our sense of what is
normal and accept that we are dealing with a dual reality: the reality of a
relatively secure and predictable present that lives side by side with a
ruinous, ever -present past.
NANCY’S ST OR Y
Few patients have put that duality into words as vividly as Nancy , the
director of nursing in a Midwestern hospital who came to Boston several
times to consult with me. Shortly after the birth of her third child, Nancy
underwent what is usually routine outpatient sur gery , a laparoscopic tubal
ligation in which the fallopian tubes are cauterized to prevent future
pregnancies. However , because she was given insuf ficient anesthesia, she
awakened after the operation began and remained aware nearly to the end,
at times falling into what she called “a light sleep” or “dream,” at times
experiencing the full horror of her situation. She was unable to alert the OR
team by moving or crying out because she had been given a standard
muscle relaxant to prevent muscle contractions during sur gery .
Some degree of “anesthesia awareness” is now estimated to occur in
approximately thirty thousand sur gical patients in the United States every
year ,32 and I had previously testified on behalf of several people who were
traumatized by the experience. Nancy , however , did not want to sue her
sur geon or anesthetist. Her entire focus was on bringing the reality of her

trauma to consciousness so that she could free herself from its intrusions
into her everyday life. I’d like to end this chapter by sharing several
passages from a remarkable series of e-mails in which she described her
grueling journey to recovery .
Initially Nancy did not know what had happened to her . “When we
went home I was still in a daze, doing the typical things of running a
household, yet not really feeling that I was alive or that I was real. I had
trouble sleeping that night. For days, I remained in my own little
disconnected world. I could not use a hair dryer , toaster , stove or anything
that warmed up. I could not concentrate on what people were doing or
telling me. I just didn’ t care. I was increasingly anxious. I slept less and
less. I knew I was behaving strangely and kept trying to understand what
was frightening me so.
“On the fourth night after the sur gery , around 3 AM, I started to realize
that the dream I had been living all this time related to conversations I had
heard in the operating room. I was suddenly transported back into the OR
and could feel my paralyzed body being burned. I was engulfed in a world
of terror and horror .” From then on, Nancy says, memories and flashbacks
erupted into her life.
“It was as if the door was pushed open slightly , allowing the intrusion.
There was a mixture of curiosity and avoidance. I continued to have
irrational fears. I was deathly afraid of sleep; I experienced a sense of terror
when seeing the color blue. My husband, unfortunately , was bearing the
brunt of my illness. I would lash out at him when I truly did not intend to. I
was sleeping at most 2 to 3 hours, and my daytime was filled with hours of
flashbacks. I remained chronically hyperalert, feeling threatened by my own
thoughts and wanting to escape them. I lost 23 pounds in 3 weeks. People
kept commenting on how great I looked.
“I began to think about dying. I developed a very distorted view of my
life in which all my successes diminished and old failures were amplified. I
was hurting my husband and found that I could not protect my children
from my rage.
“Three weeks after the sur gery I went back to work at the hospital. The
first time I saw somebody in a sur gical scrubsuit was in the elevator . I
wanted to get out immediately , but of course I could not. I then had this
irrational ur ge to clobber him, which I contained with considerable ef fort.

This episode triggered increasing flashbacks, terror and dissociation. I cried
all the way home from work. After that, I became adept at avoidance. I
never set foot in an elevator , I never went to the cafeteria, I avoided the
sur gical floors.”
Gradually Nancy was able to piece together her flashbacks and create
an understandable, if horrifying, memory of her sur gery . She recalled the
reassurances of the OR nurses and a brief period of sleep after the
anesthesia was started. Then she remembered how she began to awaken.
“The entire team was laughing about an af fair one of the nurses was
having. This coincided with the first sur gical incision. I felt the stab of the
scalpel, then the cutting, then the warm blood flowing over my skin. I tried
desperately to move, to speak, but my body didn’ t work. I couldn’ t
understand this.  I felt a deeper pain as the layers of muscle pulled apart
under their own tension. I knew I wasn’ t supposed to feel this.”
Nancy next recalls someone “rummaging around” in her belly and
identified this as the laparoscopic instruments being placed. She felt her left
tube being clamped. “Then suddenly there was an intense searing, burning
pain. I tried to escape, but the cautery tip pursued me, relentlessly burning
through. There simply are no words to describe the terror of this experience.
This pain was not in the same realm as other pain I had known and
conquered, like a broken bone or natural childbirth. It begins as extreme
pain, then continues relentlessly as it slowly burns through the tube. The
pain of being cut with the scalpel pales beside this giant.”
“Then, abruptly , the right tube felt the initial impact of the burning tip.
When I heard them laugh, I briefly lost track of where I was. I believed I
was in a torture chamber , and I could not understand why they were
torturing me without even asking for information. . . . My world narrowed
to a small sphere around the operating table. There was no sense of time, no
past, and no future. There was only pain, terror , and horror . I felt isolated
from all humanity , profoundly alone in spite of the people surrounding me.
The sphere was closing in on me.
“In my agony , I must have made some movement. I heard the nurse
anesthetist tell the anesthesiologist that I was ‘light.’ He ordered more meds
and then quietly said, ‘There is no need to put any of this in the chart.’ That
is the last memory I recalled.”

In her later e-mails to me, Nancy struggled to capture the existential
reality of trauma.
“I want to tell you what a flashback is like. It is as if time is folded or
warped, so that the past and present mer ge,  as if I were physically
transported into the past. Symbols related to the original trauma, however
benign in reality , are thoroughly contaminated and so become objects to be
hated, feared, destroyed if possible, avoided if not. For example, an iron in
any form—a toy , a clothes iron, a curling iron, came to be seen as an
instrument of torture. Each encounter with a scrub suit left me
disassociated, confused, physically ill and at times consciously angry .
“My marriage is slowly falling apart—my husband came to represent
the heartless laughing people [the sur gical team] who hurt me. I exist in a
dual state. A pervasive numbness covers me with a blanket; and yet the
touch of a small child pulls me back to the world. For a moment, I am
present and a part of life, not just an observer .
“Interestingly , I function very well at work, and I am constantly given
positive feedback. Life proceeds with its own sense of falsity .
“There is a strangeness, bizarreness to this dual existence. I tire of it.
Y et I cannot give up on life, and I cannot delude myself into believing that
if I ignore the beast it will go away . I’ve thought many times that I had
recalled all the events around the sur gery , only to find a new one.
“There are so many pieces of that 45 minutes of my life that remain
unknown. My memories are still incomplete and fragmented, but I no
longer think that I need to know everything in order to understand what
happened.
“When the fear subsides I realize I can handle it, but a part of me
doubts that I can. The pull to the past is strong; it is the dark side of my life;
and I must dwell there from time to time. The struggle may also be a way to
know that I survive—a re-playing of the fight to survive—which apparently
I won, but cannot own.”
An early sign of recovery came when Nancy needed another , more
extensive operation. She chose a Boston hospital for the sur gery , asked for a
preoperative meeting with the sur geons and the anesthesiologist specifically
to discuss her prior experience, and requested that I be allowed to join them
in the operating room. For the first time in many years I put on a sur gical

scrub suit and accompanied her into the OR while the anesthesia was
induced. This time she woke up to a feeling of safety .
T wo years later I wrote Nancy asking her permission to use her account
of anesthesia awareness in this chapter . In her reply she updated me on the
progress of her recovery: “I wish I could say that the sur gery to which you
were so kind to accompany me ended my suf fering. That sadly was not the
case. After about six more months I made two choices that proved
provident. I left my CBT therapist to work with a psychodynamic
psychiatrist and I joined a Pilates class.
“In our last month of therapy , I asked my psychiatrist why he did not
try to fix me as all other therapists had attempted, yet had failed. He told me
that he assumed, given what I had be able to accomplish with my children
and career , that I had suf ficient resiliency to heal myself, if he created a
holding environment for me to do so. This was an hour each week that
became a refuge where I could unravel the mystery of how I had become so
damaged and then re-construct a sense of myself that was whole, not
fragmented, peaceful, not tormented. Through Pilates, I found a stronger
physical core, as well as a community of women who willingly gave
acceptance and social support that had been distant in my life since the
trauma. This combination of core strengthening—psychological, social, and
physical—created a sense of personal safety and mastery , relegating my
memories to the distant past, allowing the present and future to emer ge.”

I don’ t go to therapy to find out if I’m a freak
I go and I find the one and only answer every week
And when I talk about therapy , I know what people think
That it only makes you selfish and in love with your shrink
But, oh how I loved everybody else
When I finally got to talk so much about myself
—Dar W illiams, What Do Y ou Hear in These Sounds
obody can “treat” a war , or abuse, rape, molestation, or any other
horrendous event, for that matter; what has happened cannot be
undone. But what can  be dealt with are the imprints of the trauma on body ,
mind, and soul: the crushing sensations in your chest that you may label as
anxiety or depression; the fear of losing control; always being on alert for
danger or rejection; the self-loathing; the nightmares and flashbacks; the
fog that keeps you from staying on task and from engaging fully in what
you are doing; being unable to fully open your heart to another human
being.
T rauma robs you of the feeling that you are in char ge of yourself, of
what I will call self-leadership in the chapters to come.1 The challenge of
recovery is to reestablish ownership of your body and your mind—of your
self. This means feeling free to know what you know and to feel what you

feel without becoming overwhelmed, enraged, ashamed, or collapsed. For
most people this involves (1) finding a way to become calm and focused,
(2) learning to maintain that calm in response to images, thoughts, sounds,
or physical sensations that remind you of the past, (3) finding a way to be
fully alive in the present and engaged with the people around you, (4) not
having to keep secrets from yourself, including secrets about the ways that
you have managed to survive.
These goals are not steps to be achieved, one by one, in some fixed
sequence. They overlap, and some may be more dif ficult than others,
depending on individual circumstances. In each of the chapters that follow ,
I’ll talk about specific methods or approaches to accomplish them. I have
tried to make these chapters useful both to trauma survivors and to the
therapists who are treating them. People under temporary stress may also
find them useful. I’ve used every one of these methods extensively to treat
my patients, and I have also experienced them myself. Some people get
better using just one of these methods, but most are helped by dif ferent
approaches at dif ferent stages of their recovery .
I have done scientific studies of many of the treatments I describe here
and have published the research findings in peer -reviewed scientific
journals.2 My aim in this chapter is to provide an overview of underlying
principles, a preview of what’ s to come, and some brief comments on
methods I don’ t cover in depth later on.
A NEW FOCUS FOR RECOVER Y
When we talk about trauma, we often start with a story or a question: “What
happened during the war?” “W ere you ever molested?” “Let me tell you
about that accident or that rape,” or “W as anybody in your family a problem
drinker?” However , trauma is much more than a story about something that
happened long ago. The emotions and physical sensations that were
imprinted during the trauma are experienced not as memories but as
disruptive physical reactions in the present.
In order to regain control over your self, you need to revisit the trauma:
Sooner or later you need to confront what has happened to you, but only
after you feel safe and will not be retraumatized by it. The first order of

business is to find ways to cope with feeling overwhelmed by the sensations
and emotions associated with the past.
As the previous parts of this book have shown, the engines of
posttraumatic reactions are located in the emotional brain. In contrast with
the rational brain, which expresses itself in thoughts, the emotional brain
manifests itself in physical reactions: gut-wrenching sensations, heart
pounding, breathing becoming fast and shallow , feelings of heartbreak,
speaking with an uptight and reedy voice, and the characteristic body
movements that signify collapse, rigidity , rage, or defensiveness.
Why can’ t we just be reasonable? And can understanding help? The
rational, executive brain is good at helping us understand where feelings
come from (as in: “I get scared when I get close to a guy because my father
molested me” or “I have trouble expressing my love toward my son because
I feel guilty about having killed a child in Iraq”). However , the rational
brain cannot abolish emotions, sensations, or thoughts (such as living with a
low-level sense of threat or feeling that you are fundamentally a terrible
person, even though you rationally know that you are not to blame for
having been raped). Understanding why  you feel a certain way does not
change how  you feel. But it can keep you from surrendering to intense
reactions (for example, assaulting a boss who reminds you of a perpetrator ,
breaking up with a lover at your first disagreement, or jumping into the
arms of a stranger). However , the more frazzled we are, the more our
rational brains take a backseat to our emotions.3
LIMBIC SYSTEM THERAPY
The fundamental issue in resolving traumatic stress is to restore the proper
balance between the rational and emotional brains, so that you can feel in
char ge of how you respond and how you conduct your life. When we’re
triggered into states of hyper - or hypoarousal, we are pushed outside our
“window of tolerance”—the range of optimal functioning.4 W e become
reactive and disor ganized; our filters stop working—sounds and lights
bother us, unwanted images from the past intrude on our minds, and we
panic or fly into rages. If we’re shut down, we feel numb in body and mind;

our thinking becomes sluggish and we have trouble getting out of our
chairs.
As long as people are either hyperaroused or shut down, they cannot
learn from experience. Even if they manage to stay in control, they become
so uptight (Alcoholics Anonymous calls this “white-knuckle sobriety”) that
they are inflexible, stubborn, and depressed. Recovery from trauma
involves the restoration of executive functioning and, with it, self-
confidence and the capacity for playfulness and creativity .
If we want to change posttraumatic reactions, we have to access the
emotional brain and do “limbic system therapy”: repairing faulty alarm
systems and restoring the emotional brain to its ordinary job of being a
quiet background presence that takes care of the housekeeping of the body ,
ensuring that you eat, sleep, connect with intimate partners, protect your
children, and defend against danger .
DRA WING BY LICIA SKY
Accessing the emotional brain.  The rational, analyzing part of the brain, centered on the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has no direct connections with the emotional brain, where most
imprints of trauma reside, but the medial prefrontal cortex, the center of self-awareness, does.

The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux and his colleagues have shown that
the only way we can consciously access the emotional brain is through self-
awareness, i.e. by activating the medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the
brain that notices what is going on inside us and thus allows us to feel what
we’re feeling.5 (The technical term for this is “ inter oception” —Latin for
“looking inside.”) Most of our conscious brain is dedicated to focusing on
the outside world: getting along with others and making plans for the future.
However , that does not help us manage ourselves. Neuroscience research
shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming
aware of our inner  experience and learning to befriend what is going inside
ourselves.
BEFRIENDING THE EMOTIONAL BRAIN
1. DEALING WITH HYPERAROUSAL
Over the past few decades mainstream psychiatry has focused on using
drugs to change the way we feel, and this has become the accepted way to
deal with hyper - and hypoarousal. I will discuss drugs later in this chapter ,
but first I need to stress the fact that we have a host of inbuilt skills to keep
us on an even keel. In chapter 5 we saw how emotions are registered in the
body . Some 80 percent of the fibers of the vagus nerve (which connects the
brain with many internal or gans) are af ferent; that is, they run from the
body into the brain.6 This means that we can directly train our arousal
system by the way we breathe, chant, and move, a principle that has been
utilized since time immemorial in places like China and India, and in every
religious practice that I know of, but that is suspiciously eyed as
“alternative” in mainstream culture.
In research supported by the National Institutes of Health, my
colleagues and I have shown that ten weeks of yoga practice markedly
reduced the PTSD symptoms of patients who had failed to respond to any
medication or to any other treatment.7 (I will discuss yoga in chapter 16.)
Neurofeedback, the topic of chapter 19, also can be particularly ef fective
for children and adults who are so hyperaroused or shut down that they
have trouble focusing and prioritizing.8

Learning how to breathe calmly and remaining in a state of relative
physical relaxation, even while accessing painful and horrifying memories,
is an essential tool for recovery .9 When you deliberately take a few slow ,
deep breaths, you will notice the ef fects of the parasympathetic brake on
your arousal (as explained in chapter 5). The more you stay focused on your
breathing, the more you will benefit, particularly if you pay attention until
the very end of the out breath and then wait a moment before you inhale
again. As you continue to breathe and notice the air moving in and out of
your lungs you may think about the role that oxygen plays in nourishing
your body and bathing your tissues with the ener gy you need to feel alive
and engaged. Chapter 16 documents the full-body ef fects of this simple
practice.
Since emotional regulation is the critical issue in managing the ef fects
of trauma and neglect, it would make an enormous dif ference if teachers,
army ser geants, foster parents, and mental health professionals were
thoroughly schooled in emotional-regulation techniques. Right now this still
is mainly the domain of preschool and kinder garten teachers, who deal with
immature brains and impulsive behavior on a daily basis and who are often
very adept at managing them.10
Mainstream W estern psychiatric and psychological healing traditions
have paid scant attention to self-management. In contrast to the W estern
reliance on drugs and verbal therapies, other traditions from around the
world rely on mindfulness, movement, rhythms, and action. Y oga in India,
tai chi and qigong in China, and rhythmical drumming throughout Africa
are just a few examples. The cultures of Japan and the Korean peninsula
have spawned martial arts, which focus on the cultivation of purposeful
movement and being centered in the present, abilities that are damaged in
traumatized individuals. Aikido, judo, tae kwon do, kendo, and jujitsu, as
well as capoeira from Brazil, are examples. These techniques all involve
physical movement, breathing, and meditation. Aside from yoga, few of
these popular non-W estern healing traditions have been systematically
studied for the treatment of PTSD.
2. NO MIND WITHOUT MINDFULNESS

At the core of recovery is self-awareness. The most important phrases in
trauma therapy are “Notice that” and “What happens next?” T raumatized
people live with seemingly unbearable sensations: They feel heartbroken
and suf fer from intolerable sensations in the pit of their stomach or tightness
in their chest. Y et avoiding feeling these sensations in our bodies increases
our vulnerability to being overwhelmed by them.
Body awareness puts us in touch with our inner world, the landscape of
our or ganism. Simply noticing our annoyance, nervousness, or anxiety
immediately helps us shift our perspective and opens up new options other
than our automatic, habitual reactions. Mindfulness puts us in touch with
the transitory nature of our feelings and perceptions. When we pay focused
attention to our bodily sensations, we can recognize the ebb and flow of our
emotions and, with that, increase our control over them.
T raumatized people are often afraid of feeling. It is not so much the
perpetrators (who, hopefully , are no longer around to hurt them) but their
own physical sensations that now are the enemy . Apprehension about being
hijacked by uncomfortable sensations keeps the body frozen and the mind
shut. Even though the trauma is a thing of the past, the emotional brain
keeps generating sensations that make the suf ferer feel scared and helpless.
It’ s not surprising that so many trauma survivors are compulsive eaters and
drinkers, fear making love, and avoid many social activities: Their sensory
world is lar gely of f limits.
In order to change you need to open yourself to your inner experience.
The first step is to allow your mind to focus on your sensations and notice
how , in contrast to the timeless, ever -present experience of trauma, physical
sensations are transient and respond to slight shifts in body position,
changes in breathing, and shifts in thinking. Once you pay attention to your
physical sensations, the next step is to label them, as in “When I feel
anxious, I feel a crushing sensation in my chest.” I may then say to a
patient: “Focus on that sensation and see how it changes when you take a
deep breath out, or when you tap your chest just below your collarbone, or
when you allow yourself to cry .” Practicing mindfulness calms down the
sympathetic nervous system, so that you are less likely to be thrown into
fight-or -flight.1 1 Learning to observe and tolerate your physical reactions is
a prerequisite for safely revisiting the past. If you cannot tolerate what you

are feeling right now , opening up the past will only compound the misery
and retraumatize you further .12
W e can tolerate a great deal discomfort as long as we stay conscious of
the fact that the body’ s commotions constantly shift. One moment your
chest tightens, but after you take a deep breath and exhale, that feeling
softens and you may observe something else, perhaps a tension in your
shoulder . Now you can start exploring what happens when you take a
deeper breath and notice how your rib cage expands.13 Once you feel
calmer and more curious, you can go back to that sensation in your
shoulder . Y ou should not be surprised if a memory spontaneously arises in
which that shoulder was somehow involved.
A further step is to observe the interplay between your thoughts and
your physical sensations. How are particular thoughts registered in your
body? (Do thoughts like “My father loves me” or “my girlfriend dumped
me” produce dif ferent sensations?) Becoming aware of how your body
or ganizes particular emotions or memories opens up the possibility of
releasing sensations and impulses you once blocked in order to survive.14 In
chapter 20, on the benefits of theater , I’ll describe in more detail how this
works.
Jon Kabat-Zinn, one of the pioneers in mind-body medicine, founded
the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program at the University
of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979, and his method has been
thoroughly studied for more than three decades. As he describes
mindfulness, “One way to think of this process of transformation is to think
of mindfulness as a lens, taking the scattered and reactive ener gies of your
mind and focusing them into a coherent source of ener gy for living, for
problem solving, for healing.”15
Mindfulness has been shown to have a positive ef fect on numerous
psychiatric, psychosomatic, and stress-related symptoms, including
depression and chronic pain.16 It has broad ef fects on physical health,
including improvements in immune response, blood pressure, and cortisol
levels.17 It has also been shown to activate the brain regions involved in
emotional regulation18 and to lead to changes in the regions related to body
awareness and fear .19 Research by my Harvard colleagues Britta Hölzel and
Sara Lazar has shown that practicing mindfulness even decreases the

activity of the brain’ s smoke detector , the amygdala, and thus decreases
reactivity to potential triggers.20
3. RELA TIONSHIPS
Study after study shows that having a good support network constitutes the
single most powerful protection against becoming traumatized. Safety and
terror are incompatible. When we are terrified, nothing calms us down like
the reassuring voice or the firm embrace of someone we trust. Frightened
adults respond to the same comforts as terrified children: gentle holding and
rocking and the assurance that somebody bigger and stronger is taking care
of things, so you can safely go to sleep. In order to recover , mind, body , and
brain need to be convinced that it is safe to let go. That happens only when
you feel safe at a visceral level and allow yourself to connect that sense of
safety with memories of past helplessness.
After an acute trauma, like an assault, accident, or natural disaster ,
survivors require the presence of familiar people, faces, and voices;
physical contact; food; shelter and a safe place; and time to sleep. It is
critical to communicate with loved ones close and far and to reunite as soon
as possible with family and friends in a place that feels safe. Our attachment
bonds are our greatest protection against threat. For example, children who
are separated from their parents after a traumatic event are likely to suf fer
serious negative long-term ef fects. Studies conducted during W orld W ar II
in England showed that children who lived in London during the Blitz and
were sent away to the countryside for protection against German bombing
raids fared much worse than children who remained with their parents and
endured nights in bomb shelters and frightening images of destroyed
buildings and dead people.21
T raumatized human beings recover in the context of relationships: with
families, loved ones, AA meetings, veterans’ or ganizations, religious
communities, or professional therapists. The role of those relationships is to
provide physical and emotional safety , including safety from feeling
shamed, admonished, or judged, and to bolster the courage to tolerate, face,
and process the reality of what has happened.
As we have seen, much the wiring of our brain circuits is devoted to
being in tune with others. Recovery from trauma involves (re)connecting

with our fellow human beings. This is why trauma that has occurred within
relationships is generally more dif ficult to treat than trauma resulting from
traf fic accidents or natural disasters. In our society the most common
traumas in women and children occur at the hands of their parents or
intimate partners. Child abuse, molestation, and domestic violence all are
inflicted by people who are supposed to love you. That knocks out the most
important protection against being traumatized: being sheltered by the
people you love.
If the people whom you naturally turn to for care and protection terrify
or reject you, you learn to shut down and to ignore what you feel.22 As we
saw in part 3, when your caregivers turn on you, you have to find
alternative ways to deal with feeling scared, angry , or frustrated. Managing
your terror all by yourself gives rise to another set of problems:
dissociation, despair , addictions, a chronic sense of panic, and relationships
that are marked by alienation, disconnection, and explosions. Patients with
these histories rarely make the connection between what happened to them
long ago and how they currently feel and behave. Everything just seems
unmanageable.
Relief does not come until they are able to acknowledge what has
happened and recognize the invisible demons they’re struggling with.
Recall, for example, the men I described in chapter 1 1 who had been abused
by pedophile priests. They visited the gym regularly , took anabolic steroids,
and were strong as oxen. However , in our interviews they often acted like
scared kids; the hurt boys deep inside still felt helpless.
While human contact and attunement are the wellspring of
physiological self-regulation, the promise of closeness often evokes fear of
getting hurt, betrayed, and abandoned. Shame plays an important role in
this: “Y ou will find out how rotten and disgusting I am and dump me as
soon as you really get to know me.” Unresolved trauma can take a terrible
toll on relationships. If your heart is still broken because you were assaulted
by someone you loved, you are likely to be preoccupied with not getting
hurt again and fear opening up to someone new . In fact, you may
unwittingly try to hurt them before they have a chance to hurt you.
This poses a real challenge for recovery . Once you recognize that
posttraumatic reactions started of f as ef forts to save your life, you may

gather the courage to face your inner music (or cacophony), but you will
need help to do so. Y ou have to find someone you can trust enough to
accompany you, someone who can safely hold your feelings and help you
listen to the painful messages from your emotional brain. Y ou need a guide
who is not afraid of your terror and who can contain your darkest rage,
someone who can safeguard the wholeness of you while you explore the
fragmented experiences that you had to keep secret from yourself for so
long. Most traumatized individuals need an anchor and a great deal of
coaching to do this work.
Choosing a Pr ofessional Therapist
The training of competent trauma therapists involves learning about the
impact of trauma, abuse, and neglect and mastering a variety of techniques
that can help to (1) stabilize and calm patients down, (2) help to lay
traumatic memories and reenactments to rest, and (3) reconnect patients
with their fellow men and women. Ideally the therapist will also have been
on the receiving end of whatever therapy he or she practices.
While it’ s inappropriate and unethical for therapists to tell you the
details of their personal struggles, it is perfectly reasonable to ask what
particular forms of therapy they have been trained in, where they learned
their skills, and whether they’ve personally benefited from the therapy they
propose for you.
There is no one “treatment of choice” for trauma, and any therapist
who believes that his or her particular method is the only answer to your
problems is suspect of being an ideologue rather than somebody who is
interested in making sure that you get well. No therapist can possibly be
familiar with every ef fective treatment, and he or she must be open to your
exploring options other than the ones he or she of fers. He or she also must
be open to learning from you. Gender , race, and personal background are
relevant only if they interfere with helping the patient feel safe and
understood.
Do you feel basically comfortable with this therapist? Does he or she
seem to feel comfortable in his or her own skin and with you as a fellow
human being? Feeling safe is a necessary condition for you to confront your
fears and anxieties. Someone who is stern, judgmental, agitated, or harsh is

likely to leave you feeling scared, abandoned, and humiliated, and that
won’ t help you resolve your traumatic stress . There may be times as old
feelings from the past are stirred up, when you become suspicious that the
therapist resembles someone who once hurt or abused you. Hopefully , this
is something you can work through together , because in my experience
patients get better only if they develop deep positive feelings for their
therapists. I also don’ t think that you can grow and change unless you feel
that you have some impact on the person who is treating you.
The critical question is this: Do you feel that your therapist is curious to
find out who you  are and what you , not some generic “PTSD patient,”
need? Are you just a list of symptoms on some diagnostic questionnaire, or
does your therapist take the time to find out why you do what you do and
think what you think? Therapy is a collaborative process—a mutual
exploration of your self.
Patients who have been brutalized by their caregivers as children often
do not feel safe with anyone. I often ask my patients if they can think of any
person they felt safe with while they were growing up. Many of them hold
tight to the memory of that one teacher , neighbor , shopkeeper , coach, or
minister who showed that he or she cared, and that memory is often the
seed of learning to reengage. W e are a hopeful species. W orking with
trauma is as much about remembering how we survived as it is about what
is broken.
I also ask my patients to imagine what they were like as newborns—
whether they were lovable and filled with spunk. All of them believe they
were and have some image of what they must have been like before they
were hurt.
Some people don’ t remember anybody they felt safe with. For them,
engaging with horses or dogs may be much safer than dealing with human
beings. This principle is currently being applied in many therapeutic
settings to great ef fect, including in jails, residential treatment programs,
and veterans’ rehabilitation. Jennifer , a member of the first graduating class
of the V an der Kolk Center ,23 who had come to the program as an out-of-
control, mute fourteen-year -old, said during her graduation ceremony that
having been entrusted with the responsibility of caring for a horse was the
critical first step for her . Her growing bond with her horse helped her feel

safe enough to begin to relate to the staf f of the center and then to focus on
her classes, take her SA T s, and be accepted to college.24
4. COMMUNAL RHYTHMS AND SYNCHRONY
From the moment of our birth, our relationships are embodied in responsive
faces, gestures, and touch.  As we saw in chapter 7, these are the foundations
of attachment. T rauma results in a breakdown of attuned physical
synchrony: When you enter the waiting room of a PTSD clinic, you can
immediately tell the patients from the staf f by their frozen faces and
collapsed (but simultaneously agitated) bodies. Unfortunately , many
therapists ignore those physical communications and focus only on the
words with which their patients communicate.
The healing power of community as expressed in music and rhythms
was brought home for me in the spring of 1997, when I was following the
work of the T ruth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. In some
places we visited, terrible violence continued. One day I attended a group
for rape survivors in the courtyard of a clinic in a township outside
Johannesbur g. W e could hear the sound of bullets being fired at a distance
while smoke billowed over the walls of the compound and the smell of
tear gas hung in the air . Later we heard that forty people had been killed.
Y et, while the surroundings were foreign and terrifying, I recognized
this group all too well: The women sat slumped over—sad and frozen—like
so many rape therapy groups  I had seen in Boston. I felt a familiar sense of
helplessness, and, surrounded by collapsed people, I felt myself mentally
collapse as well. Then one of the women started to hum, while gently
swaying back and forth. Slowly a rhythm emer ged; bit by bit other women
joined in. Soon the whole group was singing, moving, and getting up to
dance. It was an astounding transformation: people coming back to life,
faces becoming attuned, vitality returning to bodies. I made a vow to apply
what I was seeing there and to study how rhythm, chanting, and movement
can help to heal trauma.
W e will see more of this in chapter 20, on theater , where I show how
groups of young people—among them juvenile of fenders and at-risk foster
kids—gradually learn to work together and to depend on one another ,
whether as partners in Shakespearean swordplay or as the writers and

performers of full-length musicals. Dif ferent patients have told me how
much choral singing, aikido, tango dancing, and kickboxing have helped
them, and I am delighted to pass their recommendations on to other people I
treat.
I learned another powerful lesson about rhythm and healing when
clinicians at the T rauma Center were asked to treat a five-year -old mute
girl, Y ing Mee, who had been adopted from an orphanage in China. After
months of failed attempts to make contact with her , my colleagues Deborah
Rozelle and Liz W arner realized that her rhythmical engagement system
didn’ t work—she could not resonate with the voices and faces of the people
around her . That led them to sensorimotor therapy .25
The sensory integration clinic in W atertown, Massachusetts, is a
wondrous indoor playground filled with swings, tubs full of multicolored
rubber balls so deep that you can make yourself disappear , balance beams,
crawl spaces fashioned from plastic tubing, and ladders that lead to
platforms from which you can dive onto foam-filled mats. The staf f bathed
Y ing Mee in the tub with plastic balls; that helped her feel sensations on her
skin. They helped her sway on swings and crawl under weighted blankets.
After six weeks something shifted — and she started to talk.26
Y ing Mee’ s dramatic improvement inspired us to start a sensory
integration clinic at the T rauma Center , which we now also use in our
residential treatment programs. W e have not yet explored how well sensory
integration works for traumatized adults, but I regularly incorporate sensory
integration experiences and dance in my seminars.
Learning to become attuned provides parents (and their kids) with the
visceral experience of reciprocity . Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) is
an interactive therapy that fosters this, as is SMAR T (sensory motor arousal
regulation treatment), developed by my colleagues at the T rauma Center .27
When we play together , we feel physically attuned and experience a
sense of connection and joy . Improvisation exercises (such as those found at
http://learnimprov .com/) also are a marvelous way to help people connect in
joy and exploration. The moment you see a group of grim-faced people
break out in a giggle, you know that the spell of misery has broken.
5. GETTING IN T OUCH

Mainstream trauma treatment has paid scant attention to helping terrified
people to safely experience their sensations and emotions. Medications such
as serotonin reuptake blockers, Respiridol and Seroquel increasingly have
taken the place of helping people to deal with their sensory world.28
However , the most natural way that we humans calm down our distress is
by being touched, hugged, and rocked. This helps with excessive arousal
and makes us feel intact, safe, protected, and in char ge.
Rembrandt van Rijn:  Christ Healing the Sick . Gestures of comfort are universally
recognizable and reflect the healing power of attuned touch.
T ouch, the most elementary tool that we have to calm down, is
proscribed from most therapeutic practices. Y et you can’ t fully recover if
you don’ t feel safe in your skin. Therefore, I encourage all my patients to
engage in some sort of bodywork, be it therapeutic massage, Feldenkrais, or
craniosacral therapy .

I asked my favorite bodywork practitioner , Licia Sky , about her
practice with traumatized individuals. Here is some of what she told me: “I
never begin a bodywork session without establishing a personal connection.
I’m not taking a history; I’m not finding out how traumatized a person is or
what happened to them. I check in where they are in their body right now . I
ask them if there is anything they want me to pay attention to. All the while,
I’m assessing their posture; whether they look me in the eye; how tense or
relaxed they seem; are they connecting with me or not.
“The first decision I make is if they will feel safer face up or face
down. If I don’ t know them, I usually start face up. I am very careful about
draping; very careful to let them feel safe with whatever clothing they want
to leave on. These are important boundaries to set up right at the beginning.
“Then, with my first touch, I make firm, safe contact. Nothing forced or
sharp. Nothing too fast. The touch is slow , easy for the client to follow ,
gently rhythmic. It can be as strong as a handshake. The first place I might
touch is their hand and forearm, because that’ s the safest place to touch
anybody , the place where they can touch you back.
“Y ou have to meet their point of resistance—the place that has the most
tension—and meet it with an equal amount of ener gy . That releases the
frozen tension. Y ou can’ t hesitate; hesitation communicates a lack of trust
in yourself. Slow movement, careful attuning to the client is dif ferent from
hesitation. Y ou have to meet them with tremendous confidence and
empathy , let the pressure of your touch meet the tension they are holding in
their bodies.”
What does bodywork do for people? Licia’ s reply: “Just like you can
thirst for water , you can thirst for touch. It is a comfort to be met
confidently , deeply , firmly , gently , responsively . Mindful touch and
movement grounds people and allows them to discover tensions that they
may have held for so long that they are no longer even aware of them.
When you are touched, you wake up to the part of your body that is being
touched.
“The body is physically restricted when emotions are bound up inside.
People’ s shoulders tighten; their facial muscles tense. They spend enormous
ener gy on holding back their tears—or any sound or movement that might
betray their inner state. When the physical tension is released, the feelings
can be released. Movement helps breathing to become deeper , and as the

tensions are released, expressive sounds can be dischar ged. The body
becomes freer—breathing freer , being in flow . T ouch makes it possible to
live in a body that can move in response to being moved.
“People who are terrified need to get a sense of where their bodies are
in space and of their boundaries. Firm and reassuring touch lets them know
where those boundaries are: what’ s outside them, where their bodies end.
They discover that they don’ t constantly have to wonder who and where
they are. They discover that their body is solid and that they don’ t have to
be constantly on guard. T ouch lets them know that they are safe.”
6. T AKING ACTION
The body responds to extreme experiences by secreting stress hormones.
These are often blamed for subsequent illness and disease. However , stress
hormones are meant to give us the strength and endurance to respond to
extraordinary conditions. People who actively do  something to deal with a
disaster—rescuing loved ones or strangers, transporting people to a
hospital, being part of a medical team, pitching tents or cooking meals—
utilize their stress hormones for their proper purpose and therefore are at
much lower risk of becoming traumatized. (Nonetheless, everyone has his
or her breaking point, and even the best-prepared person may become
overwhelmed by the magnitude of the challenge.)
Helplessness and immobilization keep people from utilizing their stress
hormones to defend themselves. When that happens, their hormones still
are being pumped out, but the actions they’re supposed to fuel are thwarted.
Eventually , the activation patterns that were meant to promote coping are
turned back against the or ganism and now keep fueling inappropriate
fight/flight and freeze responses. In order to return to proper functioning,
this persistent emer gency response must come to an end. The body needs to
be restored to a baseline state of safety and relaxation from which it can
mobilize to take action in response to real danger .
My friends and teachers Pat Ogden and Peter Levine have each
developed powerful body-based therapies, sensorimotor psychotherapy29
and somatic experiencing30 to deal with this issue. In these treatment
approaches the story of what has happened takes a backseat to exploring
physical sensations and discovering the location and shape of the imprints

of past trauma on the body . Before plunging into a full-fledged exploration
of the trauma itself, patients are helped to build up internal resources that
foster safe access sensations and emotions that overwhelmed them at the
time of the trauma. Peter Levine calls this process pendulation —gently
moving in and out of accessing internal sensations and traumatic memories.
In this way patients are helped to gradually expand their window of
tolerance.
Once patients can tolerate being aware of their trauma-based physical
experiences, they are likely to discover powerful physical impulses—like
hitting, pushing, or running—that arose during the trauma but were
suppressed in order to survive. These impulses manifest themselves in
subtle body movements such as twisting, turning, or backing away .
Amplifying these movements and experimenting with ways to modify them
begins the process of bringing the incomplete, trauma-related “action
tendencies” to completion and can eventually lead to resolution of the
trauma. Somatic therapies can help patients to relocate themselves in the
present by experiencing that it is safe to move. Feeling the pleasure of
taking ef fective action restores a sense of agency and a sense of being able
to actively defend and protect themselves.
Back in 1893 Pierre Janet, the first great explorer of trauma, wrote
about “the pleasure of completed action,” and I regularly observe that
pleasure when I practice sensorimotor psychotherapy and somatic
experiencing: When patients can physically experience what it would have
felt like to fight back or run away , they relax, smile, and express a sense of
completion.
When people are forced to submit to overwhelming power , as is true
for most abused children, women trapped in domestic violence, and
incarcerated men and women, they often survive with resigned compliance.
The best way to overcome ingrained patterns of submission is to restore a
physical capacity to engage and defend. One of my favorite body-oriented
ways to build ef fective fight/flight responses is our local impact center ’ s
model mugging program, in which women (and increasingly men) are
taught to actively fight of f a simulated attack.31 The program started in
Oakland, California, in 1971 after a woman with a fifth-degree black belt in
karate was raped. W ondering how this could have happened to someone

who supposedly could kill with her bare hands, her friends concluded that
she had become de-skilled by fear . In the terms of this book, her executive
functions—her frontal lobes—went of f-line, and she froze. The model
mugging program teaches women to recondition the freeze response
through many repetitions of being placed in the “zero hour” (a military term
for the precise moment of an attack) and learning to transform fear into
positive fighting ener gy .
One of my patients, a college student with a history of unrelenting child
abuse, took the course. When I first met her , she was collapsed, depressed,
and overly compliant. Three months later , during her graduation ceremony ,
she successfully fought of f a gigantic male attacker who ended up lying
cringing on the floor (shielded from her blows by a thick protective suit)
while she faced him, arms raised in a karate stance, calmly and clearly
yelling no.
Not long afterward, she was walking home from the library after
midnight when three men jumped out of some bushes, yelling: “Bitch, give
us your money .” She later told me that she took that same karate stance and
yelled back: “Okay , guys, I’ve been looking forward to this moment. Who
wants to take me on first?” They ran away . If you’re hunched over and too
afraid to look around, you are easy prey to other people’ s sadism, but when
you walk around projecting the message “Don’ t mess with me,” you’re not
likely to be bothered.
INTEGRA TING TRAUMA TIC MEMORIES
People cannot put traumatic events behind until they are able to
acknowledge what has happened and start to recognize the invisible demons
they’re struggling with. T raditional psychotherapy has focused mainly on
constructing a narrative that explains why a person feels a particular way or ,
as Sigmund Freud put it back in 1914 in Remembering, Repeating and
W orking Thr ough:32 “While the patient lives [the trauma] through as
something real and actual, we have to accomplish the therapeutic task,
which consists chiefly of translating it back again in terms of the past.”
T elling the story is important; without stories, memory becomes frozen; and
without memory you cannot imagine how things can be dif ferent. But as we

saw in part 4, telling a story about the event does not guarantee that the
traumatic memories will be laid to rest.
There is a reason for that. When people remember an ordinary event,
they do not also relive the physical sensations, emotions, images, smells, or
sounds associated with that event. In contrast, when people fully recall their
traumas, they “have” the experience: They are engulfed by the sensory or
emotional elements of the past. The brain scans of Stan and Ute Lawrence,
the accident victims in chapter 4, show how this happens. When Stan was
remembering his horrendous accident, two key areas in his brain went
blank: the area that provides a sense of time and perspective, which makes
it possible to know that “that was then, but I am safe now ,” and another area
that integrates the images, sounds, and sensations of trauma into a coherent
story . When those parts of the brain are knocked out, you experience
something not as an event with a beginning, a middle, and an end but in
fragments of sensations, images, and emotions.
A trauma can be successfully processed only if all those brain
structures are kept online. In Stan’ s case, eye movement desensitization and
reprocessing (EMDR) allowed him to access his memories of the accident
without being overwhelmed by them. When the brain areas whose absence
is responsible for flashbacks can be kept online while remembering what
has happened, people can integrate their traumatic memories as belonging
to the past.
Ute’ s dissociation (as you recall, she shut down completely)
complicated recovery in a dif ferent way . None of the brain structures
necessary to engage in the present were online, so that dealing with the
trauma was simply impossible. W ithout a brain that is alert and present
there can be no integration and resolution. She needed to be helped to
increase her window of tolerance before she could deal with her PTSD
symptoms.
Hypnosis was the most widely practiced treatment for trauma from the
late 1800s, the time of Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud, until after W orld
W ar II. On Y ouT ube you can still watch the documentary Let Ther e Be
Light , by the great Hollywood director John Huston, which shows men
under going hypnosis to treat “war neurosis.” Hypnosis fell out of favor in
the early 1990s and there have been no recent studies of its ef fectiveness for
treating PTSD. However , hypnosis can induce a state of relative calm from

which patients can observe their traumatic experiences without being
overwhelmed by them. Since that capacity to quietly observe oneself is a
critical factor in the integration of traumatic memories, it is likely that
hypnosis, in some form, will make a comeback.
COGNITIVE BEHA VIORAL THERAPY (CBT)
During their training most psychologists are taught cognitive behavioral
therapy . CBT was first developed to treat phobias such as fear of spiders,
airplanes, or heights, to help patients compare their irrational fears with
harmless realities. Patients are gradually desensitized from their irrational
fears by bringing to mind what they are most afraid of, using their
narratives and images (“imaginal exposure”), or they are placed in actual
(but actually safe) anxiety-provoking situations (“in vivo exposure”), or
they are exposed to virtual-reality , computer -simulated scenes, for example,
in the case of combat-related PTSD, fighting in the streets of Fallujah.
The idea behind cognitive behavioral treatment is that when patients
are repeatedly exposed to the stimulus without bad things actually
happening, they gradually will become less upset; the bad memories will
have become associated with “corrective” information of being safe.33 CBT
also tries to help patients deal with their tendency to avoid, as in “I don’ t
want to talk about it.”34 It sounds simple, but, as we have seen, reliving
trauma reactivates the brain’ s alarm system and knocks out critical brain
areas necessary for integrating the past, making it likely that patients will
relive rather than resolve the trauma.
Prolonged exposure or “flooding” has been studied more thoroughly
than any other PTSD treatment. Patients are asked to “focus their attention
on the traumatic material and . . . not distract themselves with other
thoughts or activities.”35 Research has shown that up to one hundred
minutes of flooding (in which anxiety-provoking triggers are presented in
an intense, sustained form) are required before decreases in anxiety are
reported.36 Exposure sometimes helps to deal with fear and anxiety , but it
has not been proven to help with guilt or other complex emotions.37
In contrast to its ef fectiveness for irrational fears such as spiders, CBT
has not done so well for traumatized individuals, particularly those with

histories of childhood abuse. Only about one in three participants with
PTSD who finish research studies show some improvement.38 Those who
complete CBT treatment usually have fewer PTSD symptoms, but they
rarely recover completely: Most continue to have substantial problems with
their health, work, or mental well-being.39
In the lar gest published study of CBT for PTSD more than one-third of
the patients dropped out; the rest had a significant number of adverse
reactions. Most of the women in the study still suf fered from full-blown
PTSD after three months in the study , and only 15 percent no longer had
major PTSD symptoms.40 A thorough analysis of all the scientific studies of
CBT show that it works about as well as being in a supportive therapy
relationship.41 The poorest outcome in exposure treatments occurs in
patients who suf fer from “mental defeat”—those who have given up.42
Being traumatized is not just an issue of being stuck in the past; it is
just as much a problem of not being fully alive in the present. One form of
exposure treatment is virtual-reality therapy in which veterans wear high-
tech goggles that make it possible to refight the battle of Fallujah in lifelike
detail. As far as I know , the US Marines performed very well in combat.
The problem is that they cannot tolerate being home. Recent studies of
Australian combat veterans show that their brains are rewired to be alert for
emer gencies, at the expense of being focused on the small details of
everyday life.43 (W e’ll learn more about this in chapter 19, on
neurofeedback.) More than virtual-reality therapy , traumatized patients need
“real world” therapy , which helps them to feel as alive when walking
through the local supermarket or playing with their kids as they did in the
streets of Baghdad.
Patients can benefit from reliving their trauma only if they are not
overwhelmed by it. A good example is a study of V ietnam veterans
conducted in the early 1990s by my colleague Roger Pitman.44 I visited
Roger ’ s lab every week during that time, since we were conducting the
study of brain opioids in PTSD that I discussed in chapter 2. Roger would
show me the videotapes of his treatment sessions and we would discuss
what we observed. He and his colleagues pushed the veterans to talk
repeatedly about every detail of their experiences in V ietnam, but the
investigators had to stop the study because many patients became panicked

by their flashbacks, and the dread often persisted after the sessions. Some
never returned, while many of those who stayed with the study became
more depressed, violent, and fearful; some coped with their increased
symptoms by increasing their alcohol consumption, which led to further
violence and humiliation, as some of their families called the police to take
them to a hospital.
DESENSITIZA TION
Over the past two decades the prevailing treatment taught to psychology
students has been some form of systematic desensitization: helping patients
become less reactive to certain emotions and sensations. But is this the
correct goal? Maybe the issue is not desensitization but integration: putting
the traumatic event into its proper place in the overall arc of one’ s life.
Desensitization makes me think of the small boy—he must have been
about five—I saw in front of my house recently . His hulking father was
yelling at him at the top of his voice as the boy rode his tricycle down my
street. The kid was unfazed, while my heart was racing and I felt an impulse
to deck the guy . How much brutality had it taken to numb a child this young
to his father ’ s brutality? His indif ference to his father ’ s yelling must have
been the result of prolonged exposure, but, I wondered, at what price? Y es,
we can take drugs that blunt our emotions or we can learn to desensitize
ourselves. As medical students we learned to stay analytical when we had to
treat children with third-degree burns. But, as the neuroscientist Jean
Decety at the University of Chicago has shown, desensitization to our own
or to other people’ s pain tends to lead to an overall blunting of emotional
sensitivity .45
A 2010 report on 49,425 veterans with newly diagnosed PTSD from
the Iraq and Afghanistan wars who sought care from the V A showed that
fewer than one out of ten actually completed the recommended treatment.46
As in Pitman’ s V ietnam veterans, exposure treatment, as currently
practiced, rarely works for them. W e can only “process” horrendous
experiences if they do not overwhelm us. And that means that other
approaches are necessary .

DRUGS T O SAFEL Y ACCESS TRAUMA?
When I was a medical student, I spent the summer of 1966 working for Jan
Bastiaans, a professor at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was
known for his work treating Holocaust survivors with LSD. He claimed to
have achieved spectacular results, but when colleagues inspected his
archives, they found few data to support his claims. The potential of mind-
altering substances for trauma treatment was subsequently neglected until
2000, when Michael Mithoefer and his colleagues in South Carolina
received FDA permission to conduct an experiment with MDMA (ecstasy).
MDMA was classified as a controlled substance in 1985 after having been
used for years as a recreational drug. As with Prozac and other psychotropic
agents, we don’ t know exactly how MDMA works, but it is known to
increase concentrations of a number of important hormones including
oxytocin, vasopressin, cortisol, and prolactin.47 Most relevant for trauma
treatment, it increases people’ s awareness of themselves; they frequently
report a heightened sense of compassionate ener gy , accompanied by
curiosity , clarity , confidence, creativity , and connectedness. Mithoefer and
his colleagues were looking for a medication that would enhance the
ef fectiveness of psychotherapy , and they became interested in MDMA
because it decreases fear , defensiveness, and numbing, as well as helping to
access inner experience.48 They thought MDMA might enable patients to
stay within the window of tolerance so they could revisit their traumatic
memories without suf fering overwhelming physiological and emotional
arousal.
The initial pilot studies have supported that expectation.49 The first
study , involving combat veterans, firefighters, and police of ficers with
PTSD, had positive results. In the next study , of a group of twenty victims
of assault who had been unresponsive to previous forms of therapy , twelve
subjects received MDMA and eight received an inactive placebo. Sitting or
lying in a comfortable room, they then all received two eight-hour
psychotherapy sessions, mainly using internal family systems (IFS) therapy ,
the subject of chapter 17 of this book. T wo months later 83 percent of the
patients who received MDMA plus psychotherapy were considered
completely cured, compared with 25 percent of the placebo group. None of
the patients had adverse side ef fects. Perhaps most interesting, when the

participants were interviewed more than a year after the study was
completed, they had maintained their gains.
By being able to observe the trauma from the calm, mindful state that
IFS calls Self (a term I’ll discuss further in chapter 17), mind and brain are
in a position to integrate the trauma into the overall fabric of life. This is
very dif ferent from traditional desensitization techniques, which are about
blunting a person’ s response to past horrors. This is about association and
integration—making a horrendous event that overwhelmed you in the past
into a memory of something that happened a long time ago.
Nonetheless, psychedelic substances are powerful agents with a
troubled history . They can easily be misused through careless
administration and poor maintenance of therapeutic boundaries. It is to be
hoped that MDMA will not be another magic cure released from Pandora’ s
box.
WHA T ABOUT MEDICA TIONS?
People have always used drugs to deal with traumatic stress. Each culture
and each generation has its preferences—gin, vodka, beer , or whiskey;
hashish, marijuana, cannabis, or ganja; cocaine; opioids like oxycontin;
tranquilizers such as V alium, Xanax, and Klonopin. When people are
desperate, they will do just about anything to feel calmer and more in
control.50
Mainstream psychiatry follows this tradition. Over the past decade the
Departments of Defense and V eterans Af fairs combined have spent over
$4.5 billion on antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antianxiety drugs. A
June 2010 internal report from the Defense Department’ s
Pharmacoeconomic Center at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio showed
that 213,972, or 20 percent of the 1.1 million active-duty troops surveyed,
were taking some form of psychotropic drug: antidepressants,
antipsychotics, sedative hypnotics, or other controlled substances.51
However , drugs cannot “cure” trauma; they can only dampen the
expressions of a disturbed physiology . And they do not teach the lasting
lessons of self-regulation. They can help to control feelings and behavior ,
but always at a price—because they work by blocking the chemical systems

that regulate engagement, motivation, pain, and pleasure. Some of my
colleagues remain optimistic: I keep attending meetings where serious
scientists discuss their quest for the elusive magic bullet that will
miraculously reset the fear circuits of the brain (as if traumatic stress
involved only one simple brain circuit). I also regularly prescribe
medications.
Just about every group of psychotropic agents has been used to treat
some aspect of PTSD.52 The serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as
Prozac, Zoloft, Ef fexor , and Paxil have been most thoroughly studied, and
they can make feelings less intense and life more manageable. Patients on
SSRIs often feel calmer and more in control; feeling less overwhelmed
often makes it easier to engage in therapy . Other patients feel blunted by
SSRIs—they feel they’re “losing their edge.” I approach it as an empirical
question: Let’ s see what works, and only the patient can be the judge of
that. On the other hand, if one SSRI does not work, it’ s worth trying
another , because they all have slightly dif ferent ef fects. It’ s interesting that
the SSRIs are widely used to treat depression, but in a study in which we
compared Prozac with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
(EMDR) for patients with PTSD, many of whom were also depressed,
EMDR proved to be a more ef fective antidepressant than Prozac.53 I’ll
return to that subject in chapter 15.54
Medicines that tar get the autonomic nervous system, like propranolol
or clonidine, can help to decrease hyperarousal and reactivity to stress.55
This family of drugs works by blocking the physical ef fects of adrenaline,
the fuel of arousal, and thus reduces nightmares, insomnia, and reactivity to
trauma triggers.56 Blocking adrenaline  can help to keep the rational brain
online and make choices possible: “Is this really what I want to do?” Since I
have started to integrate mindfulness and yoga into my practice, I use these
medications less often, except occasionally to help patients sleep more
restfully .
T raumatized patients tend to like tranquilizing drugs, benzodiazepines
like Klonopin, V alium, Xanax, and Ativan. In many ways, they work like
alcohol, in that they make people feel calm and keep them from worrying.
(Casino owners love customers on benzodiazepines; they don’ t get upset
when they lose and keep gambling.) But also, like alcohol, benzos weaken

inhibitions against saying hurtful things to people we love. Most civilian
doctors are  reluctant to prescribe these drugs, because they have a high
addiction potential and they may also interfere with trauma processing.
Patients who stop taking them after prolonged use usually have withdrawal
reactions that make them agitated and increase posttraumatic symptoms.
I sometimes give my patients low doses of benzodiazepines to use as
needed, but not enough to take on a daily basis. They have to choose when
to use up their precious supply , and I ask them to keep a diary of what was
going on when they decided to take the pill. That gives us a chance to
discuss the specific incidents that triggered them.
A few studies have shown that anticonvulsants and mood stabilizers,
such as lithium or valproate, can have mildly positive ef fects, taking the
edge of f hyperarousal and panic.57 The most controversial medications are
the so-called second-generation antipsychotic agents, such as Risperdal and
Seroquel, the lar gest-selling psychiatric drugs in the United States ($14.6
billion in 2008). Low doses of these agents can be helpful in calming down
combat veterans and women with PTSD related to childhood abuse.58
Using these drugs is sometimes justified, for example when patients feel
completely out of control and unable to sleep or where other methods have
failed.59 But it’ s important to keep in mind that these medications work by
blocking the dopamine system, the brain’ s reward system, which also
functions as the engine of pleasure and motivation.
Antipsychotic medications such as Risperdal, Abilify , or Seroquel can
significantly dampen the emotional brain and thus make patients less
skittish or enraged, but they also may interfere with being able to appreciate
subtle signals of pleasure, danger , or satisfaction. They also cause weight
gain, increase the chance of developing diabetes, and make patients
physically inert, which is likely to further increase their sense of alienation.
These drugs are widely used to treat abused children who are
inappropriately diagnosed with bipolar disorder or mood dysregulation
disorder . More than half a million children and adolescents in America are
now taking antipsychotic drugs, which may calm them down but also
interfere with learning age-appropriate skills and developing friendships
with other children.60 A Columbia University study recently found that
prescriptions of antipsychotic drugs for privately insured two- to five-year -

olds had doubled between 2000 and 2007.61 Only 40 percent of them had
received a proper mental health assessment.
Until it lost its patent, the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson
doled out LEGO blocks stamped with the word “Risperdal” for the waiting
rooms of child psychiatrists. Children from low-income families are four
times as likely as the privately insured to receive antipsychotic medicines.
In one year alone T exas Medicaid spent $96 million on antipsychotic drugs
for teenagers and children—including three unidentified infants who were
given the drugs before their first birthdays.62 There have been no studies on
the ef fects of psychotropic medications on the developing brain.
Dissociation, self-mutilation, fragmented memories, and amnesia generally
do not respond to any of these medications.
The Prozac study that I discussed in chapter 2 was the first to discover
that traumatized civilians tend to respond much better to medications than
do combat veterans.63 Since then other studies have found similar
discrepancies. In this light it is worrisome that the Department of Defense
and the V A prescribe enormous quantities of medications to combat soldiers
and returning veterans, often without providing other forms of therapy .
Between 2001 and 201 1 the V A spent about $1.5 billion on Seroquel and
Risperdal, while Defense spent about $90 million during the same period,
even though a research paper published in 2001 showed that Risperdal was
no more ef fective than a placebo in treating PTSD.64 Similarly , between
2001 and 2012 the V A spent $72.1 million and Defense spent $44.1 million
on benzodiazepines65—medications that clinicians generally avoid
prescribing to civilians with PTSD because of their addiction potential and
lack of significant ef fectiveness for PTSD symptoms.
THE ROAD OF RECOVER Y IS THE ROAD OF LIFE
In the first chapter of this book I introduced you to a patient named Bill
whom I met over thirty years ago at the V A. Bill became one of my
longtime patient-teachers, and our relationship is also the story of my
evolution of trauma treatment .
Bill had served as a medic in V ietnam in 1967–71, and after he
returned, he tried to use the skills he had learned in the army by working on

a burn unit in a local hospital. Nursing kept him frazzled, explosive, and on
edge, but he had no idea that these problems had anything to do with what
he had experienced in V ietnam. After all, the PTSD diagnosis did not yet
exist, and Irish working-class guys in Boston didn’ t consult shrinks. His
nightmares and insomnia subsided a bit after he left nursing and enrolled in
a seminary to become a minister . He did not seek help until after his first
son was born in 1978.
The baby’ s crying triggered unrelenting flashbacks, in which he saw ,
heard, and smelled burned and mutilated children in V ietnam. He was so
out of control that some of my colleagues at the V A wanted to put him in
the hospital to treat what they thought was a psychosis. However , as he and
I started to work together and he began to feel safe with me, he gradually
opened up about what he had witnessed in V ietnam, and he slowly started
to tolerate his feelings without becoming overwhelmed. This helped him to
refocus on taking care of his family and on finishing his training as a
minister . After two years he was a pastor with his own parish, and we felt
that our work was done.
I had no further contact with Bill until he called me up eighteen years
to the day after I first met him. He was experiencing exactly the same
symptoms—flashbacks, terrible nightmares, feelings that he was going
crazy—that he’d had right after his baby was born. That son had just turned
eighteen, and Bill had accompanied him to register for the draft—at the
same armory from which Bill himself had been shipped of f to V ietnam. By
then I knew much more about treating traumatic stress, and Bill and I dealt
with the specific memories of what he had seen, heard, and smelled back in
V ietnam, details that he had been too scared to recall when we first met. W e
could now integrate these memories with EMDR, so that they became
stories of what happened long ago instead of instant transports into the hell
of V ietnam. Once he felt more settled, he wanted to deal with his childhood:
his brutal upbringing and his guilt about having left behind his younger
schizophrenic brother when he enlisted for V ietnam, unprotected against
their father ’ s violent outbursts.
Another important theme of our time together was the day-to-day pain
Bill confronted as a minister—having to bury adolescents killed in car
crashes only a few years after he’d baptized them or having couples he’d
married come back in crisis over domestic violence. Bill went on to

or ganize a support group for fellow cler gy faced with similar traumas, and
he became an important force in his community .
Bill’ s third treatment started five years later , when he developed a
serious neurological illness at age fifty-three. He had suddenly started to
experience episodic paralysis in several parts of his body , and he was
beginning to accept that he would probably spend the rest of his life in a
wheelchair . I thought his problems might be due to multiple sclerosis, but
his neurologists could not find specific lesions, and they said there was no
cure for his condition. He told me how grateful he was for his wife’ s
support. She already had arranged to have a wheelchair ramp built to the
kitchen entrance to their house.
Given his grim prognosis, I ur ged Bill to find a way to fully feel and
befriend the distressing feelings in his body , just as he had learned to
tolerate and live with his most painful memories of the war . I suggested that
he consult a body worker who had introduced me to Feldenkrais, a gentle,
hands-on approach to rearranging physical sensations and muscle
movements. When Bill came back to report on how he was doing, he
expressed delight with his increased sense of control. I mentioned that I’d
recently started to do yoga myself and that we had just opened up a yoga
program at the T rauma Center . I invited him to explore that as his next step.
Bill found a local Bikram yoga class, a hot and intense practice usually
reserved for young and ener getic people. Bill loved it, even though parts of
his body occasionally gave way in class. Despite his physical disability , he
gained a sense of bodily pleasure and mastery that he had never felt before.
Bill’ s psychological treatment had helped him put the horrendous
experience of V ietnam in the past. Now befriending his body was keeping
him from or ganizing his life around the loss of physical control. He decided
to become certified as a yoga instructor , and he began teaching yoga at his
local armory to the veterans who were returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.
T oday , ten years later , Bill continues to be fully engaged in life—with
his children and grandchildren, through his work with veterans, and in his
church. He copes with his physical limitations as an inconvenience. T o date
he has taught yoga classes to more than 1,300 returning combat veterans.
He still regularly suf fers from the sudden weakness in his limbs that
requires him to sit or lie down. But, like his memories of childhood and

V ietnam, these episodes do not dominate his existence. They are simply
part of the ongoing, evolving story of his life.

Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak knits up the o’er
wrought heart and bids it break.
—W illiam Shakespear e, Macbeth
W e can hardly bear to look. The shadow may carry the best of the
life we have not lived. Go into the basement, the attic, the refuse
bin. Find gold there. Find an animal who has not been fed or
watered. It is you!! This neglected, exiled animal, hungry for
attention, is a part of your self.
—Marion W oodman (as quoted by Stephen Cope in The Great W ork of Y our Life )
n September 2001 several or ganizations, including the National Institutes
of Health, Pfizer pharmaceuticals, and the New Y ork T imes Company
Foundation, or ganized expert panels to recommend the best treatments for
people traumatized by the attacks on the W orld T rade Center . Because
many widely used trauma interventions had never been carefully evaluated
in random communities (as opposed to patients who seek psychiatric help),
I thought that this presented an extraordinary opportunity to compare how
well a variety of dif ferent approaches would work. My colleagues were
more conservative, and after lengthy deliberations the committees

recommended only two forms of treatment: psychoanalytically oriented
therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy . Why analytic talk therapy? Since
Manhattan is one of the last bastions of Freudian psychoanalysis, it would
have been bad politics to exclude a substantial proportion of local mental
health practitioners. Why CBT? Because behavioral treatment can be
broken down into concrete steps and “manualized” into uniform protocols,
it is the favorite treatment of academic researchers, another group that could
not be ignored. After the recommendations were approved, we sat back and
waited for New Y orkers to find their way to therapists’ of fices. Almost
nobody showed up.
Dr . Spencer Eth, who ran the psychiatry department at the now-defunct
St. V incent’ s Hospital in Greenwich V illage, was curious where survivors
had turned for help, and early in 2002, together with some medical students,
he conducted a survey of 225 people who had escaped from the T win
T owers. Asked what had been most helpful in overcoming the ef fects of
their experience, the survivors credited acupuncture, massage, yoga, and
EMDR, in that order .1 Among rescue workers, massages were particularly
popular . Eth’ s survey suggests that the most helpful interventions focused
on relieving the physical burdens generated by trauma. The disparity
between the survivors’ experience and the experts’ recommendations is
intriguing. Of course, we don’ t know how many survivors eventually did
seek out more traditional therapies. But the apparent lack of interest in talk
therapy raises a basic question: What good is it to talk about your trauma?
THE UNSPEAKABLE TRUTH
Therapists have an undying faith in the capacity of talk to resolve trauma.
That confidence dates back to 1893, when Freud (and his mentor , Breuer)
wrote that trauma “immediately and permanently disappeared when we had
succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it
was provoked and in arousing its accompanying af fect, and when the
patient had described that event in the greatest possible detail and had put
the af fect into words.”2
Unfortunately , it’ s not so simple: T raumatic events are almost
impossible to put into words. This is true for all of us, not just for people

who suf fer from PTSD. The initial imprints of the events of September 1 1
were not stories but images: frantic people running down the street, their
faces covered with ash; an airplane smashing into T ower One of the W orld
T rade Center; the distant specks that were people jumping hand in hand.
Those images were replayed over and over , in our minds and on the TV
screen, until Mayor Giuliani and the media helped us create a narrative we
could share with one another .
In Seven Pillars of W isdom  T . E. Lawrence wrote of his war
experiences: “W e learned that there were pangs too sharp, griefs too deep,
ecstasies too high for our finite selves to register . When emotion reached
this pitch the mind choked; and memory went white till the circumstances
were humdrum once more.”3 While trauma keeps us dumbfounded, the path
out of it is paved with words, carefully assembled, piece by piece, until the
whole story can be revealed.
BREAKING THE SILENCE
Activists in the early campaign for AIDS awareness created a powerful
slogan: “Silence = Death.” Silence about trauma also leads to death—the
death of the soul. Silence reinforces the godforsaken isolation of trauma.
Being able to say aloud to another human being, “I was raped” or “I was
battered by my husband” or “My parents called it discipline, but it was
abuse” or “I’m not making it since I got back from Iraq,” is a sign that
healing can begin.
W e may think we can control our grief, our terror , or our shame by
remaining silent, but naming of fers the possibility of a dif ferent kind of
control. When Adam was put in char ge of the animal kingdom in the Book
of Genesis, his first act was to give a name to every living creature.
If you’ve been hurt, you need to acknowledge and name what happened
to you. I know that from personal experience: As long as I had no place
where I could let myself know what it was like when my father locked me
in the cellar of our house for various three-year -old of fenses, I was
chronically preoccupied with being exiled and abandoned. Only when I
could talk about how that little boy felt, only when I could for give him for
having been as scared and submissive as he was, did I start to enjoy the

pleasure of my own company . Feeling listened to and understood changes
our physiology; being able to articulate a complex feeling, and having our
feelings recognized, lights up our limbic brain and creates an “aha
moment.” In contrast, being met by silence and incomprehension kills the
spirit. Or , as John Bowlby so memorably put it: “What can not be spoken to
the [m]other cannot be told to the self.”
If you hide from yourself the fact that an uncle molested you when you
were young, you are vulnerable to react to triggers like an animal in a
thunderstorm: with a full-body response to the hormones that signal
“danger .” W ithout language and context, your awareness may be limited to:
“I’m scared.”  Y et, determined to stay in control, you are likely to avoid
anybody or anything that reminds you even vaguely of your trauma. Y ou
may also alternate between being inhibited and being uptight or reactive
and explosive—all without knowing why .
As long as you keep secrets and suppress information, you are
fundamentally at war with yourself. Hiding your core feelings takes an
enormous amount of ener gy , it saps your motivation to pursue worthwhile
goals, and it leaves you feeling bored and shut down. Meanwhile, stress
hormones keep flooding your body , leading to headaches, muscle aches,
problems with your bowels or sexual functions—and irrational behaviors
that may embarrass you and hurt the people around you. Only after you
identify the source of these responses can you start using your feelings as
signals of problems that require your ur gent attention.
Ignoring inner reality also eats away at your sense of self, identity , and
purpose. Clinical psychologist Edna Foa and her colleagues developed the
Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory to assess how patients think about
themselves.4 Symptoms of PTSD often include statements like  “I feel dead
inside,” “I will never be able to feel normal emotions again,” “I have
permanently changed for the worse,” “I feel like an object, not like a
person,” “I have no future,” and “I feel like I don’ t know myself anymore.”
The critical issue is allowing yourself to know what you know . That
takes an enormous amount of courage. In What It Is Like to Go to W ar ,
V ietnam veteran Karl Marlantes grapples with his memories of belonging to
a brilliantly ef fective Marine combat unit and confronts the terrible split he
discovered inside himself:

For years I was unaware of the need to heal that split, and there
was no one, after I returned, to point this out to me. . . . Why did I
assume there was only one person inside me? . . . There’ s a part of
me that just loves maiming, killing, and torturing. This part of me
isn’ t all of me. I have other elements that indeed are just the
opposite, of which I am proud. So am I a killer? No, but part of me
is. Am I a torturer? No, but part of me is. Do I feel horror and
sadness when I read in the newspapers of an abused child? Y es.
But am I fascinated?5
Marlantes tells us that his road to recovery required learning to tell the
truth, even if that truth was brutally painful.
Death, destruction, and sorrow need to be constantly justified in the
absence of some overarching meaning for the suf fering. Lack of this
overarching meaning encourages making things up, lying, to fill the gap in
meaning.6
I’d never been able to tell anyone what was going on inside. So I
forced these images back, away , for years. I began to reintegrate
that split-of f part of my experience only after I actually began to
imagine that kid as a kid, my kid perhaps. Then, out came this
overwhelming sadness—and healing. Integrating the feelings of
sadness, rage, or all of the above with the action should be
standard operating procedure for all soldiers who have killed face-
to-face. It requires no sophisticated psychological training. Just
form groups under a fellow squad or platoon member who has had
a few days of group leadership training and encourage people to
talk.7
Getting perspective on your terror and sharing it with others can
reestablish the feeling that you are a member of the human race. After the
V ietnam veterans I treated joined a therapy group where they could share
the atrocities they had witnessed and committed, they reported beginning to
open their hearts to their girlfriends.

THE MIRACLE OF SELF-DISCOVER Y
Discovering your Self in language is always an epiphany , even if finding
the words to describe your inner reality can be an agonizing process. That is
why I find Helen Keller ’ s account of how she was “born into language”8 so
inspiring.
When Helen was nineteen months old and just starting to talk, a viral
infection robbed her of her sight and hearing. Now deaf, blind, and mute,
this lovely , lively child turned into an untamed, isolated creature. After five
desperate years her family invited a partially blind teacher , Anne Sullivan,
to come from Boston to their home in rural Alabama as Helen’ s tutor . Anne
began immediately to teach Helen the manual alphabet, spelling words into
her hand letter by letter , but it took ten weeks of trying to connect with this
wild child before the breakthrough occurred. It came as Anne spelled the
word “water” into one of Helen’ s hands while she held the other under the
water pump.
Helen later recalled that moment in The Story of My Life : “W ater! That
word startled my soul, and it awoke, full of the spirit of the morning. . . .
Until that day my mind had been like a darkened chamber , waiting for
words to enter and light the lamp, which is thought. I learned a great many
words that day .”
Learning the names of things enabled the child not only to create an
inner representation of the invisible and inaudible physical reality around
her but also to find herself: Six months later she started to use the first-
person “I.”
Helen’ s story reminds me of the abused, recalcitrant, uncommunicative
kids we see in our residential treatment programs. Before she acquired
language, she was bewildered and self-centered—looking back, she called
that creature “Phantom.” And indeed, our kids come across as phantoms
until they can discover who they are and feel safe enough to communicate
what is going on with them.
In a later book, The W orld I Live In , Keller again described her birth
into selfhood: “Before my teacher came to me, I did not know that I am. I
lived in a world that was a no-world. . . . I had neither will nor intellect. . . .
I can remember all this, not because I knew that it was so, but because I

have tactual memory . It enables me to remember that I never contracted my
forehead in the act of thinking.”9
Helen’ s “tactual” memories—memories based only on touch—could
not be shared. But language opened up the possibility of joining a
community . At age eight, when Helen went with Anne to the Perkins
Institution for the Blind in Boston (where Sullivan herself had trained), she
became able to communicate with other children for the first time: “Oh,
what happiness!” she wrote. “T o talk freely with other children! T o feel at
home in the great world!”
Helen’ s discovery of language with the help of Anne Sullivan captures
the essence of a therapeutic relationship: finding words where words were
absent before and, as a result, being able to share your deepest pain and
deepest feelings with another human being. This is one of most profound
experiences we can have, and such resonance, in which hitherto unspoken
words can be discovered, uttered, and received, is fundamental to healing
the isolation of trauma—especially if other people in our lives have ignored
or silenced us. Communicating fully is the opposite of being traumatized.
KNOWING YOURSELF OR TELLING YOUR ST OR Y?
OUR DUAL A W ARENESS SYSTEM
Anyone who enters talk therapy , however , almost immediately confronts the
limitations of language. This was true of my own psychoanalysis. While I
talk easily and can tell interesting tales, I quickly realized how dif ficult it
was to feel my feelings deeply and simultaneously report them to someone
else. When I got in touch with the most intimate, painful, or confusing
moments of my life, I often found myself faced with a choice: I could either
focus on reliving old scenes in my mind’ s eye and let myself feel what I had
felt back then, or I could tell my analyst logically and coherently what had
transpired. When I chose the latter , I would quickly lose touch with myself
and start to focus on his  opinion of what I was telling him. The slightest
hint of doubt or judgment would shut me down, and I would shift my
attention to regaining his approval.
Since then neuroscience research has shown that we possess two
distinct forms of self-awareness: one that keeps track of the self across time

and one that registers the self in the present moment. The first, our
autobiographical self, creates connections among experiences and
assembles them into a coherent story . This system is rooted in language.
Our narratives change with the telling, as our perspective changes and as we
incorporate new input .
The other system, moment-to-moment self-awareness, is based
primarily in physical sensations, but if we feel safe are not rushed, we can
find words to communicate that experience as well. These two ways of
knowing are localized in dif ferent parts of the brain that are lar gely
disconnected from each other .10 Only the system devoted to self-awareness,
which is based in the medial prefrontal cortex, can change the emotional
brain.
In the groups I used to lead for veterans,  I could sometimes see these
two systems working side by side. The soldiers told horrible tales of death
and destruction, but I noticed that their bodies often simultaneously radiated
a sense of pride and belonging. Similarly , many patients tell me about the
happy families they grew up in while their bodies are slumped over and
their voices sound anxious and uptight. One system creates a story for
public consumption, and if we tell that story often enough, we are likely to
start believing that it contains the whole truth. But the other system registers
a dif ferent truth: how we experience the situation deep inside. It is this
second system that needs to be accessed, befriended, and reconciled.
Just recently at my teaching hospital, a group of psychiatric residents
and I interviewed a young woman with temporal lobe epilepsy who was
being evaluated following a suicide attempt. The residents asked her
standard questions about her symptoms, the medications she was taking,
how old she was when the diagnosis was made, what had made her try to
kill herself. She responded in a flat, matter -of-fact voice: She’d been five
when she was diagnosed. She’d lost her job; she knew she’d been faking it;
she felt worthless. For some reason one of the residents asked whether she
had been sexually abused. That question surprised me: She had given us no
indication that she had had problems with intimacy or sexuality , and I
wondered if the doctor was pursuing a private agenda.
Y et the story our patient told did not explain why she had fallen apart
after losing her job. So I asked her what it had been like for that five-year -

old girl to be told that something was wrong with her brain. That forced her
to check in with herself, as she had no ready-made script for that question.
In a subdued tone of voice she told us that the worst part of her diagnosis
was that afterward her father wanted nothing more to do with her: “He just
saw me as a defective child.” Nobody had supported her , she said, so she
basically had to manage by herself.
I then asked her how she felt now about that little girl with newly
diagnosed epilepsy who was left on her own. Instead of crying for her
loneliness or being angry about the lack of support, she said fiercely: “She
was stupid, whiny , and dependent. She should have stepped up to the plate
and sucked it up.” That passion obviously came from the part of her that
had valiantly tried to cope with her distress, and I acknowledged that it
probably had helped her survive back then. I asked her to allow that
frightened, abandoned girl to tell her what it had been like to be all alone,
her illness compounded by family rejection. She started to sob and kept
quiet for a long time until finally she said: “ No, she did not deserve that.
She should have been supported; somebody should have looked after her .”
Then she shifted again and proudly told me about her accomplishments—
how much she’d achieved despite that lack of support. Public story and
inner experience finally met.
THE BODY IS THE BRIDGE
T rauma stories lessen the isolation of trauma, and they provide an
explanation  for why people suf fer the way they do. They allow doctors to
make diagnoses, so that they can address problems like insomnia, rage,
nightmares, or numbing. Stories can also provide people with a tar get to
blame. Blaming is a universal human trait that helps people feel good while
feeling bad, or , as my old teacher Elvin Semrad used to say: “Hate makes
the world go round.” But stories also obscure a more important issue,
namely , that trauma radically changes people: that in fact they no longer are
“themselves.”
It is excruciatingly dif ficult to put that feeling of no longer being
yourself into words. Language evolved primarily to share “things out
there,” not to communicate our inner feelings, our interiority . (Again, the

language center of the brain is about as far removed from the center for
experiencing one’ s self as is geographically possible.) Most of us are better
at describing someone else than we are at describing ourselves. As I once
heard Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan say: “The task of describing
most private experiences can be likened to reaching down to a deep well to
pick up small fragile crystal figures while you are wearing thick leather
mittens.”1 1
W e can get past the slipperiness of words by engaging the self-
observing, body-based self system, which speaks through sensations, tone
of voice, and body tensions. Being able to perceive visceral sensations is
the very foundation of emotional awareness.12 If a patient tells me that he
was eight when his father deserted the family , I am likely to stop and ask
him to check in with himself: What happens inside when he tells me about
that boy who never saw his father again? Where is it registered in his body?
When you activate your gut feelings and listen to your heartbreak—when
you follow the interoceptive pathways to your innermost recesses—things
begin to change.
WRITING T O YOURSELF
There are other ways to access your inner world of feelings. One of the
most ef fective is through writing. Most of us have poured out our hearts in
angry , accusatory , plaintive, or sad letters after people have betrayed or
abandoned us. Doing so almost always makes us feel better , even if we
never send them. When you write to yourself, you don’ t have to worry
about other people’ s judgment—you just listen to your own thoughts and let
their flow take over . Later , when you reread what you wrote, you often
discover surprising truths.
As functioning members of society , we’re supposed to be “cool” in our
day-to-day interactions and subordinate our feelings to the task at hand.
When we talk with someone with whom we don’ t feel completely safe, our
social editor jumps in on full alert and our guard is up. W riting is dif ferent.
If you ask your editor to leave you alone for a while, things will come out
that you had no idea were there. Y ou are free to go into a sort of a trance
state in which your pen (or keyboard) seems to channel whatever bubbles

up from inside. Y ou can connect those self-observing and narrative parts of
your brain without worrying about the reception you’ll get.
In the practice called free writing, you can use any object as your own
personal Rorschach test for entering a stream of associations. Simply write
the first thing that comes to your mind as you look at the object in front of
you and then keep going without stopping, rereading, or crossing out. A
wooden spoon on the counter may trigger memories of making tomato
sauce with your grandmother—or of being beaten as a child. The teapot
that’ s been passed down for generations may take you meandering to the
furthest reaches of your mind to the loved ones you’ve lost or family
holidays that were a mix of love and conflict. Soon an image will emer ge,
then a memory , and then a paragraph to record it. Whatever shows up on the
paper will be a manifestation of associations that are uniquely yours.
My patients often bring in fragments of writing and drawings about
memories that they may not yet be ready to discuss. Reading the content out
loud would probably overwhelm them, but they want me to be aware of
what they are wrestling with. I tell them how much I appreciate their
courage in allowing themselves to explore hitherto hidden parts of
themselves and in entrusting me with them. These tentative
communications guide my treatment plan—for example, by helping me to
decide whether to add somatic processing, neurofeedback, or EMDR to our
current work.
As far as I’m aware, the first systematic test of the power of language
to relieve trauma was done in 1986, when James Pennebaker at the
University of T exas in Austin turned his introductory psychology class into
an experimental laboratory . Pennebaker started of f with a healthy respect
for the importance of inhibition, of keeping things to yourself, which he
viewed as the glue of civilization.13 But he also assumed that people pay a
price for trying to suppress being aware of the elephant in the room.
He began by asking each student to identify a deeply personal
experience that they’d found very stressful or traumatic. He then divided
the class into three groups: One would write about what was currently
going on in their lives; the second would write about the details of the
traumatic or stressful event; and the third would recount the facts of the
experience, their feelings and emotions about it, and what impact they

thought this event had had on their lives. All of the students wrote
continuously for fifteen minutes on four consecutive days while sitting
alone in a small cubicle in the psychology building.
The students took the study very seriously; many revealed secrets that
they had never told anyone. They often cried as they wrote, and many
confided in the course assistants that they’d become preoccupied with these
experiences. Of the two hundred participants, sixty-five wrote about a
childhood trauma. Although the death of a family member was the most
frequent topic ,  22 percent of the women and 10 percent of the men reported
sexual trauma prior to the age of seventeen.
The researchers asked the students about their health and were
surprised how often the students spontaneously reported histories of major
and minor health problems: cancer , high blood pressure, ulcers, flu,
headaches, and earaches.14 Those who reported a traumatic sexual
experience in childhood had been hospitalized an average of 1.7 days in the
previous year—almost twice the rate of the others.
The team then compared the number of visits to the student health
center participants had made during the month prior to the study to the
number in the month following it. The group that had written about both the
facts and the emotions related to their trauma clearly benefited the most:
They had a 50 percent drop in doctor visits compared with the other two
groups. W riting about their deepest thoughts and feelings about traumas had
improved their mood and  resulted in a more optimistic attitude and better
physical health.
When the students themselves were asked to assess the study , they
focused on how it had increased their self-understanding: “It helped me
think about what I felt during those times. I never realized how it af fected
me before.” “I had to think and resolve past experiences. One result of the
experiment was peace of mind. T o have to write about emotions and
feelings helped me understand how I felt and why .”15
In a subsequent study Pennebaker asked half of a group of seventy-two
students to talk into a tape recorder about the most traumatic experience of
their lives; the other half discussed their plans for the rest of the day . As
they spoke, researchers monitored their physiological reactions: blood
pleasure, heart rate, muscle tension, and hand temperature.16 This study had

similar results: Those who allowed themselves to feel their emotions
showed significant physiological changes, both immediate and long term.
During their confessions blood pressure, heart rate, and other autonomic
functions increased, but afterward their arousal fell to levels below where
they had been at the start of the study . The drop in blood pressure could still
be measured six weeks after the experiment ended.
It is now widely accepted that stressful experiences—whether divorce
or final exams or loneliness—have a negative ef fect on immune function,
but this was a highly controversial notion at the time of Pennebaker ’ s study .
Building on his protocols, a team of researchers at the Ohio State University
College of Medicine compared two groups of students who wrote either
about a personal trauma or about a superficial topic.17 Again, those who
wrote about personal traumas had fewer visits to the student health center ,
and their improved health correlated with improved immune function, as
measured by the action of T lymphocytes (natural killer cells) and other
immune markers in the blood. This ef fect was most obvious directly after
the experiment, but it could still be the detected six weeks later . W riting
experiments from around the world, with grade school students, nursing
home residents, medical students, maximum-security prisoners, arthritis
suf ferers, new mothers, and rape victims, consistently show that writing
about upsetting events improves physical and mental health.
Another aspect of Pennebaker ’ s studies caught my attention: When his
subjects talked about intimate or dif ficult issues, they often changed their
tone of voice and speaking style. The dif ferences were so striking that
Pennebaker wondered if he had mixed up his tapes. For example, one
woman described her plans for the day in a childlike, high-pitched voice,
but a few minutes later , when she described stealing one hundred dollars
from an open cash register , both the volume and pitch of her voice became
so much lower that she sounded like an entirely dif ferent person.
Alterations in emotional states were also reflected in the subjects’
handwriting. As participants changed topics, they might move from cursive
to block letters and back to cursive; there were also variations in the slant of
the letters and in the pressure of their pens.

Such changes are called “switching” in clinical practice, and we see
them often in individuals with trauma histories. Patients activate distinctly
dif ferent emotional and physiological states as they move from one topic to
another . Switching manifests not only as remarkably dif ferent vocal patterns
but also in dif ferent facial expressions and body movements. Some patients
even appear to change their personal identity , from timid to forceful and
aggressive or from anxiously compliant to starkly seductive. When they
write about their deepest fears, their handwriting often becomes more
childlike and primitive.

If patients who present in such dramatically dif ferent states are treated
as fakes, or if they are told to stop showing their unpredictably annoying
parts, they are likely to become mute. They probably will continue to seek
help, but after they have been silenced they will transmit their cries for help
not by talking but by acting: with suicide attempts, depression, and rage
attacks. As we will see in chapter 17, they will improve only if both patient
and therapist appreciate the roles that these dif ferent  states have played in
their survival.
AR T , MUSIC, AND DANCE
There are thousands of art, music, and dance therapists who do beautiful
work with abused children, soldiers suf fering from PTSD, incest victims,
refugees, and torture survivors, and numerous accounts attest to the
ef fectiveness of expressive therapies.18 However , at this point we know
very little about how they work or about the specific aspects of traumatic
stress they address, and it would present an enormous logistical and

financial challenge to do the research necessary to establish their value
scientifically .
The capacity of art, music, and dance to circumvent the speechlessness
that comes with terror may be one reason they are used as trauma
treatments in cultures around the world. One of the few systematic studies
to compare nonverbal artistic expression with writing  was done by James
Pennebaker and Anne Krantz, a San Francisco dance and movement
therapist.19 One-third of a group of sixty-four students was asked to
disclose a personal traumatic experience through expressive body
movements for at least ten minutes a day for three consecutive days and
then to write about it for another ten minutes. A second group danced but
did not write about their trauma, and a third group engaged in a routine
exercise program. Over the three following months members of all groups
reported that they felt happier and healthier . However , only the expressive
movement group that also wrote showed objective evidence: better physical
health and an improved grade-point average. (The study did not evaluate
specific PTSD symptoms.) Pennebaker and Krantz concluded: “The mere
expression of the trauma is not suf ficient. Health does appear to require
translating experiences into language.”
However , we still do not know whether this conclusion—that language
is essential to healing—is, in fact, always true. W riting studies that have
focused on PTSD symptoms (as opposed to general health) have been
disappointing. When I discussed this with Pennebaker , he cautioned me that
most writing studies of PTSD patients have been done in group settings
where participants were expected to share their stories. He reiterated the
point I’ve made above — that the object of writing is to write to yourself, to
let your self know what you have been trying to avoid.
THE LIMITS OF LANGUAGE
T rauma overwhelms listeners as well as speakers. In The Gr eat W ar in
Modern Memory , his masterful study of W orld W ar I, Paul Fussell
comments brilliantly on the zone of silence that trauma creates:

One of the cruxes of war . . . is the collision between events and
the language available—or thought appropriate—to describe
them. . . . Logically there is no reason why the English language
could not perfectly well render the actuality of . . . warfare: it is
rich in terms like blood , terr or , agony , madness , shit , cruelty ,
mur der , sell-out , pain  and hoax , as well as phrases like legs blown
off , intestines gushing out over his hands , scr eaming all night ,
bleeding to death fr om the r ectum , and the like. . . . The problem
was less one of “language” than of gentility and optimism. . . . The
real reason [that soldiers fall silent] is that soldiers have discovered
that no one is very interested in the bad news they have to report.
What listener wants to be torn and shaken when he doesn’ t have to
be? W e have made unspeakable  mean indescribable: it really
means nasty .20
T alking about painful events doesn’ t necessarily establish community
—often quite the contrary . Families and or ganizations may reject members
who air the dirty laundry; friends and family can lose patience with people
who get stuck in their grief or hurt. This is one reason why trauma victims
often withdraw and why their stories become rote narratives, edited into a
form least likely to provoke rejection.
It is an enormous challenge to find safe places to express the pain of
trauma, which is why survivor groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, Adult
Children of Alcoholics, Narcotics Anonymous, and other support groups
can be so critical. Finding a responsive community in which to tell your
truth makes recovery possible. That is also why survivors need professional
therapists who are trained to listen to the agonizing details of their lives. I
recall the first time a veteran told me about killing a child in V ietnam. I had
a vivid flashback to when I was about seven years old and my father told
me that a child next door had been beaten to death by Nazi soldiers in front
of our house for showing a lack of respect. My reaction to the veteran’ s
confession was too much to bear , and I had to end the session. That is why
therapists need to have done their own intensive therapy , so they can take
care of themselves and remain emotionally available to their patients, even
when their patients’ stories arouse feelings of rage or revulsion.

A dif ferent problem arises when trauma victims themselves become
literally speechless—when the language area of the brain shuts down.21 I
have seen this shutdown in the courtroom in many immigration cases and
also in a case brought against a perpetrator of mass slaughter in Rwanda.
When asked to testify about their experiences, victims often become so
overwhelmed that they are barely able to speak or are hijacked into such
panic that they can’ t clearly articulate what happened to them. Their
testimony is often dismissed as being too chaotic, confused, and fragmented
to be credible.
Others try to recount their history in a way that keeps them from being
triggered. This can make them come across as evasive and unreliable
witnesses. I have seen dozens of legal cases dismissed because asylum
seekers were unable to give coherent accounts of their reasons for fleeing.
I’ve also known numerous veterans whose claims were denied by the
V eterans Administration because they could not tell precisely what had
happened to them.
Confusion and mutism are routine in therapy of fices: W e fully expect
that our patients will become overwhelmed if we keep pressing them for the
details of their story . For that reason we’ve learned to “pendulate” our
approach to trauma, to use a term coined by my friend Peter Levine. W e
don’ t avoid confronting the details, but we teach our patients how to safely
dip one toe in the water and then take it out again, thus approaching the
truth gradually .
W e start by establishing inner “islands of safety” within the body .22
This means helping patients identify parts of the body , postures, or
movements where they can ground themselves whenever they feel stuck,
terrified, or enraged. These parts usually lie outside the reach of the vagus
nerve, which carries the messages of panic to the chest, abdomen, and
throat, and they can serve as allies in integrating the trauma. I might ask a
patient if her hands feel okay , and if she says yes, I’ll ask her to move them,
exploring their lightness and warmth and flexibility . Later , if I see her chest
tighten and her breath almost disappear , I can stop her and ask her to focus
on her hands and move them, so that she can feel herself as separate from
the trauma. Or I might ask her to focus on her out breath and notice how she

can change it, or ask her to lift her arms up and down with each breath—a
qigong movement.
For some patients tapping acupressure points is a good anchor .23 I ask
others to feel the weight of their body in the chair or to plant their feet on
the floor . I might ask a patient who is collapsing into silence to see what
happens when he sits up straight. Some patients discover their own islands
of safety—they begin to “get” that they can create body sensations to
counterbalance feeling out of control. This sets the stage for trauma
resolution: pendulating between states of exploration and safety , between
language and body , between remembering the past and feeling alive in the
present.
DEALING WITH REALITY
Dealing with traumatic memories is, however , just the beginning of
treatment. Numerous studies have found that people with PTSD have more
general problems with focused attention and with learning new
information.24 Alexander McFarlane did a simple test: He asked a group of
people to name as many words beginning with the letter B  as they could in
one minute. Normal subjects averaged fifteen words; those with PTSD
averaged three or four . Normal subjects hesitated when they saw
threatening words like “blood,” “wound,” or “rape”; McFarlane’ s PTSD
subjects reacted just as hesitantly to ordinary words like “wool,” “ice
cream,” and “bicycle.”25
After a while most people with PTSD don’ t spend a great deal of time
or ef fort on dealing with the past—their problem is simply making it
through the day . Even traumatized patients who are making real
contributions in teaching, business, medicine, or the arts and who are
successfully raising their children expend a lot more ener gy on the everyday
tasks of living than do ordinary mortals.
Y et another pitfall of language is the illusion that our thinking can
easily be corrected if it doesn’ t “make sense.” The “cognitive” part of
cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing such “dysfunctional
thinking.” This is a top-down approach to change in which the therapist
challenges or “reframes” negative cognitions, as in “ Let’ s  compare your

feelings that you are to blame for your rape  with the actual facts of the
matter” or  “Let’ s compare your terror of driving with  the statistics about
road safety today .”
I’m reminded of the distraught woman who once came to our clinic
asking for help with her two-month-old because the baby was “so selfish.”
W ould she have benefited from a fact sheet on child development or an
explanation of the concept of altruism? Such information would be unlikely
to help her until she gained access to the frightened, abandoned parts of
herself—the parts expressed by her terror of dependence.
There is no question traumatized people have irrational thoughts: “I
was to blame for being so sexy .” “The other guys weren’ t afraid—they’re
real men.” “I should have known better than to walk down that street.” It’ s
best to treat those thoughts as cognitive flashbacks—you don’ t ar gue with
them any more than you would ar gue with someone who keeps having
visual flashbacks of a terrible accident. They are residues of traumatic
incidents: thoughts they were thinking when, or shortly after , the traumas
occurred that are reactivated under stressful conditions. A better way to
treat them is with EMDR, the subject of the following chapter .
BECOMING SOME BODY
The reason people become overwhelmed by telling their stories, and the
reason they have cognitive flashbacks, is that their brains have changed. As
Freud and Breuer observed, trauma does not simply act as a releasing agent
for symptoms. Rather , “the psychical trauma—or more precisely the
memory of the trauma—acts like a foreign body which long after its entry
must continue to be regarded as an agent that still is at work.”26 Like a
splinter that causes an infection, it is the body’ s response to the foreign
object that becomes the problem more than the object itself.
Modern neuroscience solidly supports Freud’ s notion that many of our
conscious thoughts are complex rationalizations for the flood of instincts,
reflexes, motives, and deep-seated memories that emanate from the
unconscious. As we have seen, trauma interferes with the proper
functioning of brain areas that manage and interpret experience . A robust
sense of self—one that allows a person to state confidently , “This is what I

think and feel” and “This is what is going on with me”—depends on a
healthy and dynamic interplay among these areas.
Almost every brain-imaging study of trauma patients finds abnormal
activation of the insula. This part of the brain integrates and interprets the
input from the internal or gans—including our muscles, joints, and balance
(proprioceptive) system—to generate the sense of being embodied. The
insula can transmit signals to the amygdala that trigger fight/fight
responses. This does not require any cognitive input or any conscious
recognition that something has gone awry—you just feel on edge and
unable to focus or , at worst, have a sense of imminent doom. These
powerful feelings are generated deep inside the brain and cannot be
eliminated by reason or understanding.
Being constantly assaulted by , but consciously cut of f from, the origin
of bodily sensations produces alexithymia: not being able to sense and
communicate what is going on with you. Only by getting in touch with your
body , by connecting viscerally with your self, can you regain a sense of
who you are, your priorities and values. Alexithymia, dissociation, and
shutdown all involve the brain structures that enable us to focus, know what
we feel, and take action to protect ourselves. When these essential
structures are subjected to inescapable shock, the result may be confusion
and agitation, or it may be emotional detachment, often accompanied by
out-of-body experiences—the feeling you’re watching yourself from far
away . In other words trauma makes people feel like either  some body else ,
or like no body . In order to overcome trauma, you need help to get back in
touch with your body , with your Self .
There is no question that language is essential: Our sense of Self
depends on being able to or ganize our memories into a coherent whole.27
This requires  well-functioning connections between the conscious brain and
the self system of the body—connections that often are damaged by trauma.
The full story  can be told only after those structures are repaired and after
the groundwork has been laid: after no body becomes some body .

W as it a vision, or a waking dream? 
 Fled is that music;—Do I wake or sleep?
—John Keats
avid, a middle-aged contractor , came to see me because his violent
rage attacks were making his home a living hell. During our first
session he told me a story about something that had happened to him the
summer he was twenty-three. He was working as a lifeguard, and one
afternoon a group of kids were roughhousing in the pool and drinking beer .
David told them alcohol was not allowed. In response the boys attacked
him, and one of them took out his left eye with a broken beer bottle. Thirty
years later he still had nightmares and flashbacks about the stabbing.
He was merciless in his criticisms of his own teenage son and often
yelled at him for the slightest infraction, and he simply could not bring
himself to show any af fection toward his wife. On some level he felt that
the tragic loss of his eye gave him permission to abuse other people, but he
also hated the angry , vengeful person he had become. He had noticed that
his ef forts to manage his rage made him chronically tense, and he wondered
if his fear of losing control had made love and friendship impossible.
During his second visit I introduced a procedure called eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). I asked David to go back to the
details of his assault and bring to mind his images of the attack, the sounds

he had heard, and the thoughts that had gone through his mind. “Just let
those moments come back,” I told him.
I then asked him to follow my index finger as I moved it slowly back
and forth about twelve inches from his right eye. W ithin seconds a cascade
of rage and terror came to the surface, accompanied by vivid sensations of
pain, blood running down his cheek, and the realization that he couldn’ t see.
As he reported these sensations, I made an occasional encouraging sound
and kept moving my finger back and forth. Every few minutes I stopped
and asked him to take a deep breath. Then I asked him to pay attention to
what was now on his mind, which was a fight he had had in school. I told
him to notice that and to stay with that memory . Other memories emer ged,
seemingly at random: looking for his assailants everywhere, wanting to hurt
them, getting into barroom brawls. Each time he reported a new memory or
sensation, I ur ged him to notice what was coming to mind and resumed the
finger movements.
At the end of that visit he looked calmer and visibly relieved. He told
me that the memory of the stabbing had lost its intensity—it was now
something unpleasant that had happened a long time ago. “It really sucked,”
he said thoughtfully , “and it kept me of f-kilter for years, but I’m surprised
what a good life I eventually was able to carve out for myself.”
Our third session, the following week, dealt with the aftermath of the
trauma: how he had used drugs and alcohol for years to cope with his rage.
As we repeated the EMDR sequences, still more memories arose. David
remembered talking with a prison guard he knew about having his
incarcerated assailant killed and then changing his mind. Recalling this
decision was profoundly liberating: He had come to see himself as a
monster who was barely in control, but realizing that he’d turned away from
revenge put him back in touch with a mindful, generous side of himself.
Next he spontaneously realized he was treating his son the way he had
felt toward his teenaged attackers. As our session ended, he asked if I could
meet with him and his family so he could tell his son what had happened
and ask for his for giveness. At our fifth and final session he reported that he
was sleeping better and said that for the first time in his life he felt a sense
of inner peace. A year later he called to report not only that his he and wife
had grown closer and had started to practice yoga together but also that he
laughed more and took real pleasure in his gardening and woodworking.

LEARNING ABOUT EMDR
My experience with David is one of many I have had over the past two
decades in which EMDR helped to make painful re-creations of the trauma
a thing of the past. My introduction to this method came through Maggie, a
spunky young psychologist who ran a halfway house for sexually abused
girls. Maggie got into one confrontation after another , clashing with nearly
everybody—except the thirteen- and fourteen-year -old girls she cared for .
She did drugs, had dangerous and often violent boyfriends, had frequent
altercations with her bosses, and moved from place to place because she
could not tolerate her roommates (nor they her). I never understood how she
had mobilized enough stability and concentration to earn a PhD in
psychology from a reputable graduate school.
Maggie had been referred to a therapy group I was running for women
with similar problems. During her second meeting she told us that her father
had raped her twice, once when she was five years old and once when she
was seven. She was convinced it had been her fault. She loved her daddy ,
she explained, and she must have been so seductive that he could not
control himself. Listening to her I thought, “She might not blame her father ,
but she sure is blaming just about everybody else”—including her previous
therapists for not helping her get better . Like many trauma survivors, she
told one story with words and another in her actions, in which she kept
replaying various aspects of her trauma.
Then one day Maggie came to the group eager to discuss a remarkable
experience she’d had the previous weekend at an EMDR training for
professionals. At that time I’d heard only that EMDR was a new fad in
which therapists wiggled their fingers in front of patients’ eyes. T o me and
my academic colleagues, it sounded like yet another of the crazes that have
always plagued psychiatry , and I was convinced that this would turn out to
be another of Maggie’ s misadventures.
Maggie told us that during her EMDR session she had vividly
remembered her father ’ s rape when she was seven—remembered it from
inside her child’ s body . She could feel physically how small she was; she
could feel her father ’ s huge body on top of her and could smell the alcohol
on his breath. And yet, she told us, even as she relived the incident she was
able to observe it from the point of view of her twenty-nine-year -old self.

She burst into tears: “I was such a little girl. How could a huge man do this
to a little girl?” She cried for a while and then said: “It’ s over now . I now
know what happened. It wasn’ t my fault. I was a little girl and there was
nothing I could do to keep him from molesting me.”
I was astounded. I had been looking for a long time for a way to help
people revisit their traumatic past without becoming retraumatized. It
seemed that Maggie had had an experience as lifelike as a flashback and yet
had not been hijacked by it. Could EMDR make it safe for people to access
the imprints of trauma? Could it then transform them into memories of
events that had happened far in the past?
Maggie had a few more EMDR sessions and remained in our group
long enough for us to see how she changed. She was much less angry , but
she kept that sardonic sense of humor that I enjoyed so much. A few
months later she got involved with a very dif ferent kind of man than she’d
ever been attracted to before. She left the group, announcing that she’d
resolved her trauma, and I decided it was time for me to get trained in
EMDR.
EMDR: FIRST EXPOSURES
Like many scientific advances, EMDR originated with a chance
observation. One day in 1987 psychologist Francine Shapiro was walking
through a park, preoccupied with some painful memories, when she noticed
that rapid eye movements produced a dramatic relief from her distress. How
could a major treatment modality grow from such a brief experience? How
is it possible that such a simple process had not been noted before? Initially
skeptical about her observation she subjected her method to years of
experimentation and research, gradually building it into a standardized
procedure that could be taught and tested in controlled studies.1
I arrived for my first EMDR training in need of some trauma
processing myself. A few weeks earlier the Jesuit priest who was chair of
my department at Massachusetts General Hospital had suddenly  shut down
the T rauma Clinic, leaving us scrambling for a new site and new funds to
treat our patients, train our students, and conduct our research. At around
the same time, my friend Frank Putnam, who was doing the long-term study

of sexually abused girls that I discussed in chapter 10, was fired from  the
National Institutes of Health and Rick Kluft, the country’ s foremost expert
on dissociation, lost his unit at the Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital. It
might have all been  a  coincidence,  but it felt as if my whole world was
under attack.
My distress about the T rauma Clinic seemed like a good test for my
EMDR trial. While I was following my partner ’ s fingers with my eyes, a
rapid succession of fuzzy childhood scenes came to mind: intense family
dinner -table conversations, confrontations with schoolmates during recess,
throwing pebbles at a shed window with my older brother—all of them the
sort of vivid, floating, “hypnopompic” images we experience when we
slumber late on a Sunday morning, then for get the moment we fully
awaken.
After about half an hour my fellow trainee and I revisited the scene in
which my boss told me that he was closing my clinic. Now I felt resigned:
“Okay , it happened, and now it’ s time to move on.” I never looked back; the
clinic later reconstituted itself and has thrived ever since. W as EMDR the
sole reason I was able to let go of my anger and distress? Of course I’ll
never know for certain, but my mental journey—through unrelated
childhood scenes to putting the episode to rest—was unlike anything I had
experienced in talk therapy .
What happened next, when it was my turn to administer EMDR, was
even more intriguing. W e rotated to a dif ferent group, and my new fellow
student, whom I’d never met before, told me he wanted to address some
painful childhood incidents involving his father , but he did not want to
discuss them. I had never worked on anybody’ s trauma without knowing
“the story ,” and I was annoyed and flustered by his refusal to share any
details. While I was moving my fingers in front of his eyes, he looked
intensely distressed—he began sobbing, and his breathing became rapid and
shallow . But  each time I asked him the questions that the protocol called
for , he refused to tell me what came to his mind.
At the end of our  forty-five-minute session, the first thing my colleague
said was that he’d found dealing with me so unpleasant that he would never
refer a patient to me. Otherwise, he remarked, the EMDR session had
resolved the matter of his father ’ s abuse . While I was skeptical and
suspected that his rudeness toward me was a carryover from unresolved

feelings toward his father , there was no question that he appeared much
more relaxed.
I turned to my EMDR trainer , Gerald Puk, and told him how
flummoxed I was. This man clearly did not like me, and had looked
profoundly distressed during the EMDR session, but now he was telling me
that his long-standing misery was gone. How could I possibly know what
he had or had not resolved if he was unwilling to tell me what had happened
during the session?
Gerry smiled and asked if by chance I had become a mental health
professional in order to solve some of my own personal issues. I confirmed
that most people who knew me thought that might be the case. Then he
asked if I found it meaningful when people told me their trauma stories.
Again, I had to agree with him. Then he said: “Y ou know , Bessel, maybe
you need to learn to put your voyeuristic tendencies on hold. If it’ s
important for you to hear trauma stories, why don’ t you go to a bar , put a
couple of dollars on the table, and say to your neighbor , ‘I’ll buy you a
drink if you tell me your trauma story .’ But you really need to know the
dif ference between your desire to hear stories and your patient’ s internal
process of healing.” I took Gerry’ s admonition to heart and ever since have
enjoyed repeating it to my students.
I left my EMDR training preoccupied with three issues that fascinate
me to this day:
EMDR loosens up something  in the mind/brain that gives
people rapid access to loosely associated memories and images
from their past. This seems to help them put the traumatic
experience into a lar ger context or perspective.
People may be able to heal from trauma without talking about it.
EMDR enables them to observe their experiences in a new way ,
without verbal give-and-take with another person.
EMDR can help even if the patient and the therapist do not have
a trusting relationship. This was particularly intriguing because
trauma, understandably , rarely leaves people with an open,
trusting heart.

In the years since, I have done EMDR with patients who spoke Swahili,
Mandarin, and Breton, all languages in which I can say only , “Notice that,”
the key EMDR instruction. (I always had a translator available, but
primarily to explain the steps of the process.) Because EMDR doesn’ t
require patients to speak about the intolerable or explain to a therapist why
they feel so upset, it allows them to stay fully focused on their internal
experience, with sometimes extraordinary results.
STUDYING EMDR
The T rauma Clinic was saved by a manager at the Massachusetts
Department of Mental Health who had followed our work with children and
now asked us to take on the task of or ganizing the community trauma
response team for the Boston area. That was enough to cover our basic
operations, and the rest was supplied by an ener getic staf f who loved what
we were doing—including the newly discovered power of EMDR to cure
some of the patients whom we’d been unable to help before.
My colleagues and I began to show one another videotapes of our
EMDR sessions with PTSD patients, which enabled us to observe dramatic
week-by-week improvements. W e then started to formally measure their
progress on a standard PTSD rating scale. W e also arranged with Elizabeth
Matthew , a young neuroimaging specialist at the New England Deaconess
Hospital, to have twelve patients’ brains scanned before and after their
treatment. After only three EMDR sessions eight of the twelve had shown a
significant decrease in their PTSD scores. On their scans we could see a
sharp increase in prefrontal lobe activation after treatment, as well as much
more activity in the anterior cingulate and the basal ganglia. This shift could
account for the dif ference in how they now experienced their trauma.
One man reported: “I remember it as though it was a real memory , but
it was more distant. T ypically , I drowned in it, but this time I was floating
on top. I had the feeling that I was in control.” A woman told us: “Before, I
felt each and every step of it. Now it is like a whole, instead of fragments,
so it is more manageable.” The trauma had lost its immediacy and become a
story about something that happened a long time ago.

W e subsequently secured funding from the National Institutes of
Mental Health to compare the ef fects of EMDR with standard doses of
Prozac or a placebo.2 Of our eighty-eight subjects thirty received EMDR,
twenty-eight Prozac, and the rest the sugar pill. As often happens, the
people on placebo did well. After eight weeks their 42 percent improvement
was greater than that for many other treatments that are promoted as
“evidence based.”
The group on Prozac did slightly better than the placebo group, but
barely so. This is typical of most studies of drugs for PTSD: Simply
showing up brings about a 30 percent to 42 percent improvement; when
drugs work, they add an additional 5 percent to 15 percent. However , the
patients on EMDR did substantially better than those on either Prozac or the
placebo: After eight EMDR sessions one in four were completely cured
(their PTSD scores had dropped to negligible levels), compared with one in
ten of the Prozac group. But the real dif ference occurred over time: When
we interviewed our subjects eight months later , 60 percent of those who had
received EMDR scored as being completely cured. As the great psychiatrist
Milton Erickson said, once you kick the log, the river will start flowing.
Once people started to integrate their traumatic memories, they
spontaneously continued to improve. In contrast, all those who had taken
Prozac relapsed when they went of f the drug.
This study was significant because it demonstrated that a focused,
trauma-specific therapy for PTSD like EMDR could be much more
ef fective than medication. Other studies have confirmed that if patients take
Prozac or related drugs like Celexa, Paxil, and Zoloft, their PTSD
symptoms often improve, but only as long as they keep taking them. This
makes drug treatment much more expensive in the long run. (Interestingly ,
despite Prozac’ s status as a major antidepressant, in our study EMDR also
produced a greater reduction in depression scores than taking the
antidepressant.)
Another key finding of our study: Adults with histories of childhood
trauma responded very dif ferently to EMDR from those who were
traumatized as adults. At the end of eight weeks, almost half of the adult-
onset group that received EMDR scored as completely cured, while only 9
percent of the child-abuse group showed such pronounced improvement.

Eight months later the cure rate was 73 percent for the adult-onset group,
compared with 25 percent for those with histories of child abuse. The child-
abuse group had small but consistently positive responses to Prozac.
These results reinforce the findings that I reported in chapter 9: Chronic
childhood abuse causes very dif ferent mental and biological adaptations
than discrete traumatic events in adulthood. EMDR is a powerful treatment
for stuck traumatic memories, but it doesn’ t necessarily resolve the ef fects
of the betrayal and abandonment that accompany physical or sexual abuse
in childhood. Eight weeks of therapy of any kind is rarely suf ficient to
resolve the legacy of long-standing trauma.
As of 2014 our EMDR study had the most positive outcome of any
published study of people who developed their PTSD in reaction to a
traumatic event as an adult. But despite these results, and those of dozens of
other studies, many of my colleagues continue to be  skeptical about EMDR
— perhaps because it seems too good to be true, too simple to be so
powerful. I surely can understand that sort of skepticism—EMDR is an
unusual procedure. Interestingly , in the first solid scientific study using
EMDR in combat veterans with PTSD, EMDR was expected to do so
poorly that it was included as the control condition for comparison with
biofeedback-assisted relaxation therapy . T o the researchers’ surprise, twelve
sessions of EMDR turned out to be the more ef fective treatment.3 EMDR
has since become one of the treatments for PTSD sanctioned by the
Department of V eterans Af fairs.
IS EMDR A FORM OF EXPOSURE THERAPY?
Some psychologists have hypothesized that EMDR actually desensitizes
people to the traumatic material and thus is related to exposure therapy . A
more accurate description would be that it integrates  the traumatic material.
As our research showed, after EMDR people thought of the trauma as a
coherent event in the past, instead of experiencing sensations and images
divorced from any context.
Memories evolve and change. Immediately after a memory is laid
down, it under goes a lengthy process of integration and reinterpretation—a
process that automatically happens in the mind/brain without any input

from the conscious self. When the process is complete, the experience is
integrated with other life events and stops having a life of its own.4 As we
have seen, in PTSD this process fails and the memory remains stuck—
undigested and raw .
Unfortunately , few psychologists are taught during their training how
the memory-processing system in the brain works. This omission can lead
to misguided approaches to treatment. In contrast to phobias (such as a
spider phobia, which is based on a specific irrational fear), posttraumatic
stress is the result of a fundamental reor ganization of the central nervous
system based on having experienced an actual threat of annihilation, (or
seeing someone else being annihilated), which reor ganizes self experience
(as helpless) and the interpretation of reality (the entire world is a
dangerous place).
During exposure patients initially become extremely upset. As they
revisit the traumatic experience, they show sharp increases in their heart
rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones. But if they manage to stay with
the treatment and keep reliving their trauma, they slowly become less
reactive and  less prone to disintegrate when they recall the event. As a
result, they get lower scores on their PTSD ratings. However , as far as we
know , simply exposing someone to the old trauma does not integrate the
memory into the overall context of their lives, and it rarely restores them to
the level of joyful engagement with people and pursuits they had prior to
the trauma.
In contrast, EMDR, as well as the treatments discussed in subsequent
chapters—internal family systems, yoga, neurofeedback, psychomotor
therapy , and theater—focus not only on regulating the intense memories
activated by trauma but also on restoring a sense of agency , engagement,
and commitment through ownership of body and mind.
PROCESSING TRAUMA WITH EMDR
Kathy was a twenty-one-year -old student at a local university . When I first
met her , she looked terrified. She had been in psychotherapy for three years
with a therapist whom she trusted and felt understood by but with whom
she was not making any progress. After her third suicide attempt her

university health service referred her to me, hoping that the new technique
I’d told them about could help her .
Like several of my other traumatized patients, Kathy was able to
become completely absorbed in her studies: When she read a book or wrote
a research paper , she could block out everything else about her life. This
enabled her to be a competent student, even when she had no idea how to
establish a loving relationship with herself, let alone with an intimate
partner .
Kathy told me that her father had used her for many years for child
prostitution, which would normally have made me think of using EMDR
only as an adjunctive therapy . However , she turned out to be an EMDR
virtuoso and recovered completely after eight sessions, the shortest time
thus far in my experience for someone with a history of severe childhood
abuse. Those sessions took place fifteen years ago, and I recently met with
her to discuss the pros and cons of her adopting a third child. She was a
delight: smart, funny , and joyfully engaged with her family and her work as
an assistant professor of child development.
I’d like to share my notes on Kathy’ s fourth EMDR treatment, not only
to demonstrate what typically happens in such a session  but also to reveal
the human mind in action as it integrates a traumatic experience. No brain
scan, blood test, or rating scale can measure this, and even a video
recording can convey only a shadow of how EMDR can unleash the
imaginative powers of the mind.
Kathy sat with her chair at a forty-five-degree angle to mine, so that we
were about four feet apart. I asked her to bring a particularly painful
memory to mind and encouraged her to recall what she had heard, saw ,
thought, and felt in her body as it took place. (My records do not show
whether she told me what the particular memory was; my guess is probably
not, since I did not write it down.)
I asked her whether she was now “in the memory ,” and when she said
yes, I asked her how real it felt on a scale of one to ten. About a nine, she
said. Then I asked her to follow my moving finger with her eyes. From time
to time, after completing a set of about twenty-five eye movements, I might
say: “T ake a deep breath,” followed by: “What do you get now?” or “What
comes to mind now?” Kathy would then tell me what she was thinking.
Whenever her tone of voice, facial expression, body movements, or

breathing patterns indicated that this was an emotionally significant theme,
I would say , “Notice that,” and start another set of eye movements, during
which she did not speak. Other than uttering those few words, I remained
silent for the next forty-five minutes.
Here is the association Kathy reported after the first eye-movement
sequence: “I realize that I have scars—from when he tied my hands behind
my back. The other scar is when he marked me to claim me as his, and
there [she points] are bite marks.” She looked stunned but surprisingly calm
as she recalled, “I remember being doused in gasoline—he took Polaroid
pictures of me—and then I was submer ged in water . I was gang raped by
my father and two of his friends; I was tied to a table; I remember them
raping me with Budweiser bottles.”
My stomach was clenching, but I didn’ t comment beyond asking Kathy
to keep those memories in mind. After about thirty more back-and-forth
movements I stopped when I saw that she was smiling. When I asked what
she was thinking, she said, “I was in a karate class; it was great! I really
kicked butt! I saw them backing of f. I yelled, ‘Don’ t you see you are
hurting me? I am not your girlfriend.’” I said, “Stay there,” and began the
next sequence. When it ended, Kathy said: “I have an image of two me’ s—
this smart, pretty little girl . . . and that little slut. All these women who
could not take care of themselves or me or their men—leaving it up to me
to service all these men.” She started to sob during the next sequence, and
when we stopped, she said: “I saw how little I was—the brutalization of the
little girl. It was not my fault.” I nodded and said, “That’ s right—stay
there.” The next round ended with Kathy reporting: “I’m picturing my life
now—my big me holding my little me—saying, ‘Y ou are safe now .’” I
nodded encouragingly and continued.
The images kept coming: “I have pictures of a bulldozer flattening the
house I grew up in. It’ s over!” Then Kathy started on a dif ferent track: “I
am thinking about how much I like Jef frey [a boy in one of her classes].
Thinking that he might not want to hang out with me. Thinking I can’ t
handle it. I have never been someone’ s girlfriend before and I don’ t know
how .” I asked her what she thought she needed to know and began the next
sequence. “Now , there is a person who just wants to be with me—it is too
simple. I don’ t know how to just be myself around men. I am petrified.”

As she tracked my finger , Kathy started to sob. When I stopped, she
told me: “I had an image of Jef frey and me sitting in the cof feehouse. My
father comes in the door . He starts screaming at the top of his lungs and he
is wielding an ax; he says, ‘I told you that you belong to me.’ He puts me
on top of the table — then he rapes me, and then he rapes Jef frey .” She was
crying hard now . “How can you be open with somebody when you have
visions of your dad raping you and then raping us both?” I wanted to
comfort her , but I knew it was more important to keep her associations
moving. I asked her to focus on what she felt in her body: “I feel it in my
forearms, in my shoulders, and my right chest. I just want to be held.” W e
continued the EMDR and when we stopped, Kathy looked relaxed. “I heard
Jef frey say it’ s okay , that he was sent here to take care of me. And that it
was not anything that I did and that he just wants to be with me for my
sake.” Again I asked what she felt in her body . “I feel really peaceful. A
little bit shaky — like when you’re using new muscles. Some relief. Jef frey
knows all this already . I feel like I’m alive and that it is all over . But I am
afraid that my father has another little girl, and that makes me very , very
sad. I want to save her .”
But as we continued the trauma returned, together with other thoughts
and images: “I need to throw up. . . . I have intrusions of lots of smells — bad
cologne, alcohol, vomit.” A few minutes later Kathy was crying profusely:
“I really feel my mom here now . It feels like she wants me to for give her . I
have the sense that the same thing happened to her — she is apologizing to
me over and over . She’ s telling me that this happened to her — that it was my
grandfather . She’ s also telling me that my grandmother is really sorry for
not being there to protect me.” I kept asking her to take deep breaths and
stay with whatever was coming up.
At the end of the next sequence Kathy said: “I feel like it’ s over . I felt
my grandmother holding me at my current age — telling me that she is so
sorry she married my grandfather . That she and my mom are making sure
that it stops here.” After one final EMDR sequence Kathy was smiling: “I
have an image of pushing my father out of the cof feehouse and Jef frey
locking the door behind him. He stands outside. Y ou can see him through
the glass—everybody’ s making fun of him.”
W ith the help of EMDR Kathy was able to integrate the memories of
her trauma and call on her imagination to help her lay them to rest, arriving

at a sense of completion and control. She did so with minimal input from
me and without any discussion of the particulars of her experiences. (I
never felt a reason to question their accuracy; her experiences were real to
her , and my job was to help her deal with them in the present.) The process
freed something in her mind/brain to activate new images, feelings, and
thoughts; it was as if her life force emer ged to create new possibilities for
her future.5
As we’ve seen, traumatic memories persist as split-of f, unmodified
images, sensations, and feelings. T o my mind the most remarkable feature
of EMDR is its apparent capacity to activate a series of unsought and
seemingly unrelated sensations, emotions, images, and thoughts in
conjunction with the original memory . This way of reassembling old
information into new packages may be just the way we integrate ordinary ,
nontraumatic day-to-day experiences.
EXPLORING THE SLEEP CONNECTION
Shortly after learning about EMDR I was asked to speak about my work at
the sleep laboratory headed by Allan Hobson at the Massachusetts Mental
Health Center . Hobson (together with his teacher , Michel Jouvet)6 was
famous for discovering where dreams are generated in the brain, and one of
his research assistants, Robert Stickgold, was just then beginning to explore
the function of dreams. I showed the group a videotape of a patient who had
suf fered from severe PTSD for thirteen years after a terrible car accident
and who, in only two sessions of EMDR, had transformed from a helpless
panicked victim into a confident, assertive woman. Bob was fascinated.
A few weeks later a friend of Stickgold’ s family became so depressed
after the death of her cat that she had to be hospitalized. The attending
psychiatrist concluded that the cat’ s death had triggered unresolved
memories of the death of the woman’ s mother when she was twelve, and he
connected her with Roger Solomon, a well-known EMDR trainer , who
treated her successfully . Afterward she called Stickgold and said, “Bob, you
have to study this. It’ s really strange — it has to do with your brain, not your
mind.”

Soon afterward an article appeared in the journal Dr eaming  suggesting
that EMDR was related to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep — the phase of
sleep in which dreaming occurs.7 Research had already shown that sleep,
and dream sleep in particular , plays a major role in mood regulation. As the
article in Dr eaming  pointed out, the eyes move rapidly back and forth in
REM sleep, just as they do in EMDR. Increasing our time in REM sleep
reduces depression, while the less REM sleep we get, the more likely we
are to become depressed.8
Of course, PTSD is notoriously associated with disturbed sleep, and
self-medication with alcohol or drugs further disrupts REM sleep. During
my time at the V A my colleagues and I had found that the veterans with
PTSD frequently woke themselves up soon after going into REM sleep9—
probably because they had activated a trauma fragment during a dream.10
Other researchers have also noticed this phenomenon, but thought that it
was irrelevant to understanding PTSD.1 1
T oday we know that both deep sleep and REM sleep play important
roles in how memories change over time. The sleeping brain reshapes
memory by increasing the imprint of emotionally relevant information
while helping irrelevant material fade away .12 In a series of elegant studies
Stickgold and his colleagues showed that the sleeping brain can even make
sense out of information whose relevance is unclear while we are awake
and integrate it into the lar ger memory system.13
Dreams keep replaying, recombining, and reintegrating pieces of old
memories for months and even years.14 They constantly update the
subterranean realities that determine what our waking minds pay attention
to. And perhaps most relevant to EMDR, in REM sleep we activate more
distant associations than in either non-REM sleep or the normal waking
state. For example, when subjects are wakened from non-REM sleep and
given a word-association test, they give standard responses: hot/cold,
hard/soft, etc. W akened from REM sleep, they make less conventional
connections, such as thief/wrong.15 They also solve simple anagrams more
easily after REM sleep. This shift toward activation of distant associations
could explain why dreams are so bizarre.16
Stickgold, Hobson, and their colleagues thus discovered that dreams
help to for ge new relationships between apparently unrelated memories.17

Seeing novel connections is the cardinal feature of creativity; as we’ve
seen, it’ s also essential to healing. The inability to recombine experiences is
also one of the striking features of PTSD. While Noam in chapter 4 could
imagine a trampoline to save future victims of terrorism, traumatized people
are trapped in frozen associations: Anybody who wears a turban will try to
kill me; any man who finds me attractive wants to rape me.
Finally , Stickgold suggests a clear link between EMDR and memory
processing in dreams: “If the bilateral stimulation of EMDR can alter brain
states in a manner similar to that seen during REM sleep then there is now
good evidence that EMDR should be able to take advantage of sleep-
dependent processes, which may be blocked or inef fective in PTSD
suf ferers, to allow ef fective memory processing and trauma resolution.”18
The basic EMDR instruction, “Hold that image in your mind and just watch
my fingers moving back and forth,” may very well reproduce what happens
in the dreaming brain. As this book is going to press Ruth Lanius and I are
studying how the brain reacts, both while remembering a traumatic event
and an ordinary experience, to saccadic eye movements as subjects lie in an
fMRI scanner . Stay tuned.
ASSOCIA TION AND INTEGRA TION
Unlike conventional exposure treatment, EMDR spends very little time
revisiting the original trauma. The trauma itself is certainly the starting
point, but the focus is on stimulating and opening up the associative
process. As our Prozac/EMDR study showed, drugs can blunt the images
and sensations of terror , but they remain embedded in the mind and body . In
contrast with the subjects who improved on Prozac—whose memories were
merely blunted, not integrated as an event that happened in the past, and
still caused considerable anxiety—those who received EMDR no longer
experienced the distinct imprints of the trauma: It had become a story of a
terrible event that had happened a long time ago. As one of my patients
said, making a dismissive hand gesture: “It’ s over .”
While we don’ t yet know precisely how EMDR works, the same is true
of Prozac. Prozac has an ef fect on serotonin, but whether its levels go up or
down, and in which brain cells, and why that makes people feel less afraid,

is still unclear . W e likewise don’ t know precisely why talking to a trusted
friend gives such profound relief, and I am surprised how few people seem
eager to explore that question.19
Clinicians have only one obligation: to do whatever they can to help
their patients get better . Because of this, clinical practice has always been a
hotbed for experimentation. Some experiments fail, some succeed, and
some, like EMDR, dialectical behavior therapy , and internal family systems
therapy , go on to change the way therapy is practiced. V alidating all these
treatments takes decades and is hampered by the fact that research support
generally goes to methods that have already been proven to work. I am
much comforted by considering the history of penicillin: Almost four
decades passed between the discovery of its antibiotic properties by
Alexander Fleming in 1928 and the final elucidation of its mechanisms in
1965.

he first time I saw Annie she was slumped over in a chair in my
waiting room, wearing faded jeans and a purple Jimmy Clif f T -shirt.
Her legs were visibly shaking, and she kept staring at the floor even after I
invited her in. I had very little information about her , other than that she
was forty-seven years old and taught special-needs children. Her body
communicated clearly that she was too terrified to engage in conversation—
or even to provide routine information about her address or insurance plan.
People who are this scared can’ t think straight, and any demand to perform
will only make them shut down further . If you insist, they’ll run away and
you’ll never see them again.

Annie shuf fled into my of fice and remained standing, barely breathing,
looking like a frozen bird. I knew we couldn’ t do anything until I could help
her quiet down. Moving to within six feet of her and making sure she had
unobstructed access to the door , I encouraged her to take slightly deeper
breaths. I breathed with her and asked her to follow my example, gently
raising my arms from my sides as she inhaled and lowering them as I
exhaled, a qigong technique that one of my Chinese students had taught me.
She stealthily followed my movements, her eyes still fixed on the floor . W e
spent about half an hour this way . From time to time I quietly asked her to
notice how her feet felt against the floor and how her chest expanded and
contracted with each breath. Her breath gradually became slower and
deeper , her face softened, her spine straightened a bit, and her eyes lifted to
about the level of my Adam’ s apple. I began to sense the person behind that
overwhelming terror . Finally she looked more relaxed and showed me the
glimmer of a smile, a recognition that we both were in the room. I
suggested that we stop there for now—I’d made enough demands on her—
and asked whether she would like to come back a week later . She nodded
and muttered, “Y ou sure are weird.”
As I got to know Annie, I inferred from the notes she wrote and the
drawings she gave me that she had been dreadfully abused by both her
father and her mother as a very young child. The full story was only
gradually revealed, as she slowly learned to call up some of the things that
had happened to her without her body being hijacked into uncontrollable
anxiety .
I learned that Annie was extraordinarily skilled and caring in her work
with special-needs kids. (I tried out quite a few of the techniques she told
me about with the children in our own clinic and found them extremely
helpful). She would talk freely about the children she taught but would clam
up immediately if we ver ged on her relationships with adults. I knew she
was married, but she barely mentioned her husband. She often coped with
disagreements and confrontations by making her mind disappear . When she
felt overwhelmed she’d cut her arms and breasts with a razor blade. She had
spent years in various forms of therapy and had tried many dif ferent
medications, which had done little to help her deal with the imprints of her
horrendous past. She had also been admitted to several psychiatric hospitals

to manage her self-destructive behaviors, again without much apparent
benefit.
In our early therapy sessions, because Annie could only hint at what
she was feeling and thinking before she would shut down and freeze, we
focused on calming the physiological chaos within. W e used every
technique that I had learned over the years, like breathing with a focus on
the out breath, which activates the relaxing parasympathetic nervous
system. I also taught her to use her fingers to tap a sequence of acupressure
points on various parts of her body , a practice often taught under the name
EFT (Emotional Freedom T echnique), which has been shown to help
patients stay within the window of tolerance and often has positive ef fects
on PTSD symptoms.1
THE LEGACY OF INESCAP ABLE SHOCK
Because we can now identify the brain circuits involved in the alarm
system, we know , more or less, what was happening in Annie’ s brain as she
sat that first day in my waiting room: Her smoke detector , her amygdala,
had been rewired to interpret certain situations as harbingers of life-
threatening danger , and it was sending ur gent signals to her survival brain to
fight, freeze, or flee. Annie had all these reactions simultaneously—she was
visibly agitated and mentally shut down.
As we’ve seen, broken alarm systems can manifest in various ways,
and if your smoke detector malfunctions, you cannot trust the accuracy of
your perceptions. For example, when Annie started to like me she began to
look forward to our meetings, but she would arrive at my of fice in an
intense panic. One day she had a flashback of feeling excited that her father
was coming home soon—but later that evening he molested her . For the
first time, she realized that her mind automatically associated excitement
about seeing someone she loved with the terror of being molested.
Small children are particularly adept at compartmentalizing experience,
so that Annie’ s natural love for her father and her dread of his assaults were
held in separate states of consciousness. As an adult Annie blamed herself
for her abuse, because she believed that the loving, excited little girl she
once was had led her father on—that she had brought the molestation upon

herself. Her rational mind told her this was nonsense, but this belief
emanated from deep within her emotional, survival brain, from the basic
wiring of her limbic system. It would not change until she felt safe enough
within her body to mindfully go back into that experience and truly know
how that little girl had felt and acted during the abuse.
THE NUMBING WITHIN
One of the ways the memory of helplessness is stored is as muscle tension
or feelings of disintegration in the af fected body areas: head, back, and
limbs in accident victims,  vagina and rectum in victims of sexual abuse.
The lives of many trauma survivors come to revolve around bracing against
and neutralizing unwanted sensory experiences, and most people I see in
my practice have become experts in such  self-numbing. They may become
serially obese or anorexic or addicted to exercise or work.  At least half of
all traumatized people try to dull their intolerable inner world with drugs or
alcohol. The flip side of numbing is sensation seeking. Many people cut
themselves to make the numbing go away , while others try bungee jumping
or high-risk activities like prostitution and gambling.  Any of these methods
can give them a false and paradoxical feeling of control.
When people are chronically angry or scared, constant muscle tension
ultimately leads to spasms, back pain, migraine headaches, fibromyalgia,
and other forms of chronic pain. They may visit multiple specialists,
under go extensive diagnostic tests, and be prescribed multiple medications,
some of which may provide temporary relief but all of which fail to address
the underlying issues. Their diagnosis will come to define their reality
without ever being identified as a symptom of their attempt to cope with
trauma.
The first two years of my therapy with Annie focused on helping her
learn to tolerate her physical sensations for what they were—just sensations
in the present, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. W e worked on
helping her stay calm enough to notice what she felt without judgment, so
she could observe these unbidden images and feelings as residues of a
terrible past and not as unending threats to her life today .

Patients like Annie continuously challenge us to find new ways of
helping people  regulate their arousal and control their own physiology . That
is how my T rauma Center colleagues and I stumbled upon yoga.
FINDING OUR W A Y T O YOGA: BOTT OM-UP
REGULA TION
Our involvement with yoga started in 1998 when Jim Hopper and I first
heard about a new biological marker , heart rate variability (HR V), that had
recently been discovered to be a good measure of how well the autonomic
nervous system is working. As you’ll recall from chapter 5, the autonomic
nervous system is our brain’ s most elementary survival system, its two
branches regulating arousal throughout the body . Roughly speaking, the
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) uses chemicals like adrenaline to fuel
the body and brain to take action, while the parasympathetic nervous
system (PNS) uses acetylcholine to help regulate basic body functions like
digestion, wound healing, and sleep and dream cycles. When we’re at our
best, these two systems work closely together to keep us in an optimal state
of engagement with our environment and with ourselves.
Heart rate variability measures the relative balance between the
sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems. When we inhale, we
stimulate the SNS, which results in an increase in heart rate. Exhalations
stimulate the PNS, which decreases how fast the heart beats. In healthy
individuals inhalations and exhalations produce steady , rhythmical
fluctuations in heart rate: Good heart rate variability is a measure of basic
well-being.
Why is HR V important? When our autonomic nervous system is well
balanced, we have a reasonable degree of control over our response to
minor frustrations and disappointments, enabling us to calmly assess what
is going on when we feel insulted or left out. Ef fective arousal modulation
gives us control over our impulses and emotions: As long as we manage to
stay calm, we can choose how we want to respond. Individuals with poorly
modulated autonomic nervous systems are easily thrown of f balance, both
mentally and physically . Since the autonomic nervous system or ganizes
arousal in both body and brain, poor HR V—that is, a lack of fluctuation in

heart rate in response to breathing—not only has negative ef fects on
thinking and feeling but also on how the body responds to stress. Lack of
coherence between breathing and heart rate makes people vulnerable to a
variety of physical illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer , in addition to
mental problems such as depression and PTSD.2
In order to study this issue further , we acquired a machine to measure
HR V and started to put bands around the chests of research subjects with
and without PTSD to record the depth and rhythm of their breathing while
little monitors attached to their earlobes picked up their pulse. After we’d
tested about sixty subjects, it became clear that people with PTSD have
unusually low HR V . In other words, in PTSD the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems are out of sync.3 This added a new twist
to the complicated trauma story: W e confirmed that yet another brain
regulatory system was not functioning as it should.4 Failure to keep this
system in balance is one explanation why traumatized people like Annie are
so vulnerable to overrespond to relatively minor stresses: The biological
systems that are meant to help us cope with the vagaries of life fail to meet
the challenge.
Our next scientific question was: Is there a way for people to improve
their HR V? I had a personal incentive to explore this question, as I had
discovered that my own HR V was not nearly robust enough to guarantee
long-term physical health. An Internet search turned up studies showing
that marathon running markedly increased HR V . Sadly , that was of little
use, since neither I nor our patients were good candidates for the Boston
Marathon. Google also listed seventeen thousand yoga sites claiming that
that yoga improved HR V , but we were unable to find any supporting
studies. Y ogis may have developed a wonderful method to help people find
internal balance and health, but back in 1998 not much work had been done
on evaluating their claims with the tools of the W estern medical tradition.


Heart rate variability (HR V) in a well-r egulated person.  The rising and falling black lines
represent breathing, in this case slow and regular inhalations and exhalations. The gray area
shows fluctuations in heart rate. Whenever this individual inhales, his heart rate goes up;
during exhalations the heart slows down. This pattern of heart rate variability reflects excellent
physiological health.
Responding to upset.  When someone remembers an upsetting experience, breathing speeds up
and becomes irregular , as does heart rate. Heart and breath no longer stay perfectly in sync.
This is a normal response.
HR V in PTSD.  Breathing is rapid and shallow . Heart rate is slow and out of synch with the
breath. This is a typical pattern of a shut-down person with chronic PTSD.
A person with chr onic PTSD r eliving a trauma memory .  Breathing initially is labored and
deep, typical of a panic reaction. The heart races out of synch with the breath. This is followed
by rapid, shallow breathing and slow heart rate, signs that the person is shutting down.
Since then, however , scientific methods have confirmed that changing
the way one breathes can improve problems with anger , depression, and
anxiety5 and that yoga can positively af fect such wide-ranging medical
problems as high blood pressure, elevated stress hormone secretion,6
asthma, and low-back pain.7 However , no psychiatric journal had published
a scientific study of yoga for PTSD until our own work appeared in 2014.8

As it happened, a few days after our Internet search a lanky yoga
teacher named David Emerson walked through the front door of the T rauma
Center . He told us that he’d developed a modified form of hatha yoga to
deal with PTSD and that he’d been holding classes for veterans at a local
vet center and for women in the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center . W ould we
be interested in working with him? Dave’ s visit eventually grew into a very
active yoga program, and in due course we received the first grant from the
National Institutes of Health to study the ef fects of yoga on PTSD. Dave’ s
work also contributed to my developing my own regular yoga practice and
becoming a frequent teacher at Kripalu, a yoga center in the Berkshire
Mountains in western Massachusetts. (Along the way , my own HR V pattern
improved as well.)
In choosing to explore yoga to improve HR V we were taking an
expansive approach to the problem. W e could simply have used any of a
number of reasonably priced handheld devices that train people to slow
their breathing and synchronize it with their heart rate, resulting in a state of
“cardiac coherence” like the pattern shown in the first illustration above.9
T oday there are a variety of apps that can help improve HR V with the aid of
a smartphone.10 In our clinic we have workstations where patients can train
their HR V , and I ur ge all my patients who, for one reason or another , cannot
practice yoga, martial arts, or qigong to train themselves at home. (See
Resources for more information.)
EXPLORING YOGA
Our decision to study yoga led us deeper into trauma’ s impact on the body .
Our first experimental yoga classes met in a room generously donated by a
nearby studio. David Emerson and his colleagues  Dana Moore and Jodi
Carey volunteered as instructors, and my research team figured out how we
could best measure yoga’ s ef fects on psychological functioning. W e put
flyers in neighborhood supermarkets and laundromats to advertise our
classes and interviewed dozens of people who called in response.
Ultimately we selected thirty-seven women who had severe trauma histories
and who had already received many years of therapy without much benefit.
Half the volunteers were selected at random for the yoga group, while the

others would receive a well-established mental health treatment, dialectical
behavior therapy (DBT), which teaches people how to apply mindfulness to
stay calm and in control. Finally , we commissioned an engineer at MIT to
build us a complicated computer that could measure HR V simultaneously in
eight dif ferent people. (In each study group there were multiple classes,
each with no more than eight participants.) While yoga significantly
improved arousal problems in PTSD and dramatically improved our
subjects’ relationships to their bodies (“I now take care of my body”; “I
listen to what my body needs”), eight weeks of DBT did not af fect their
arousal levels or PTSD symptoms. Thus, our interest in yoga gradually
evolved from a focus on learning whether yoga can change HR V (which it
can)1 1 to helping traumatized people learn to comfortably inhabit their
tortured bodies.
Over time we also started a yoga program for marines at Camp Lejeune
and have worked successfully with various other programs to implement
yoga programs for veterans with PTSD. Even though we have no formal
research data on the veterans, it looks as if yoga is at least as ef fective for
them as it has been for the women in our studies.
All yoga programs consist of a combination of breath practices
( pranayama ), stretches or postures ( asanas ), and meditation. Dif ferent
schools of yoga emphasize variations in intensity and focus within these
core components. For example, variations in the speed and depth of
breathing  and use of the mouth, nostrils, and throat all produce dif ferent
results, and some techniques have powerful ef fects on ener gy .12 In our
classes we keep the approach simple. Many of our patients are barely aware
of their breath, so learning to focus on the in and out breath, to notice
whether the breath was fast or slow , and to count breaths in some poses can
be a significant accomplishment.13
W e gradually introduce a limited number of classic postures. The
emphasis is not on getting the poses “right” but on helping the participants
notice which muscles are active at dif ferent times. The sequences are
designed to create a rhythm between tension and relaxation—something we
hope they will begin to perceive in their day-to-day lives.
W e do not teach meditation as such, but we do foster mindfulness by
encouraging students to observe what is happening in dif ferent parts of the

body from pose to pose. In our studies we keep seeing how dif ficult it is for
traumatized people to feel completely relaxed and physically safe in their
bodies. W e measure our subjects’ HR V by placing tiny monitors on their
arms during shavasana , the pose at the end of most classes during which
practitioners lie face up, palms up, arms and legs relaxed. Instead of
relaxation we picked up too much muscle activity to get a clear signal.
Rather than going into a state of quiet repose, our students’ muscles often
continue to prepare them to fight unseen enemies. A major challenge in
recovering from trauma remains being able to achieve a state of total
relaxation and safe surrender .
LEARNING SELF-REGULA TION
After seeing the success of our pilot studies, we established a therapeutic
yoga program at the T rauma Center . I thought that this might be an
opportunity for Annie to develop a more caring relationship with her body ,
and I ur ged her to try it. The first class was dif ficult. Merely being given an
adjustment by the instructor was so terrifying that she went home and
slashed herself—her malfunctioning alarm system interpreted even a gentle
touch on her back as an assault. At the same time Annie realized that yoga
might of fer her a way to liberate herself from the constant sense of danger
that she felt in her body . W ith my encouragement she returned the following
week.
Annie had always found it easier to write about her experiences than to
talk about them. After her second yoga class she wrote to me: “I don’ t know
all of the reasons that yoga terrifies me so much, but I do know that it will
be an incredible source of healing for me and that is why I am working on
myself to try it. Y oga is about looking inward instead of outward and
listening to my body , and a lot of my survival has been geared around never
doing those things. Going to the class today my heart was racing and part of
me really wanted to turn around, but then I just kept putting one foot in
front of the other until I got to the door and went in. After the class I came
home and slept for four hours. This week I tried doing yoga at home and the
words came to me ‘Y our body has things to say .’ I said back to myself, ‘I
will try and listen.’”

A few days later Annie wrote: “Some thoughts during and after yoga
today . It occurred to me how disconnected I must be from my body when I
cut it. When I was doing the poses I noticed that my jaw and the whole area
from where my legs end to my bellybutton is where I am tight, tense and
holding the pain and memories. Sometimes you have asked me where I feel
things and I can’ t even begin to locate them, but today I felt those places
very clearly and it made me want to cry in a gentle kind of way .”
The following month both of us went on vacation and, invited to stay in
touch, Annie wrote to me again: “I’ve been doing yoga on my own in a
room that overlooks the lake. I’m continuing to read the book you lent me
[Stephen Cope’ s wonderful Y oga and the Quest for the T rue Self ]. It’ s really
interesting to think about how much I have been refusing to listen to my
body , which is such an important part of who I am. Y esterday when I did
yoga I thought about letting my body tell me the story it wants to tell and in
the hip opening poses there was a lot of pain and sadness. I don’ t think my
mind is going to let really vivid images come up as long as I am away from
home, which is good. I think now about how unbalanced I have been and
about how hard I have tried to deny the past, which is a part of my true self.
There is so much I can learn if I am open to it and then I won’ t have to fight
myself every minute of every day .”
One of the hardest yoga positions for Annie to tolerate was one that’ s
often called Happy Baby , in which you lie on your back with your knees
deeply bent and the soles of your feet pointing to the ceiling, while holding
your toes with your hands. This rotates the pelvis into a wide-open position.
It’ s easy to understand why this would make a rape victim feel extremely
vulnerable. Y et, as long as Happy Baby (or any posture that resembles it)
precipitates intense panic, it is dif ficult to be intimate. Learning how to
comfortably assume Happy Baby is a challenge for many patients in our
yoga classes.
GETTING T O KNOW ME: CUL TIV A TING
INTEROCEPTION
One of the clearest lessons from contemporary neuroscience is that our
sense of ourselves is anchored in a vital connection with our bodies.14 W e

do not truly know ourselves unless we can feel and interpret our physical
sensations; we need to register and act on these sensations to navigate
safely through life.15 While numbing (or compensatory sensation seeking)
may make life tolerable, the price you pay is that you lose awareness of
what is going on inside your body and, with that, the sense of being fully ,
sensually alive.
In chapter 6 I discussed alexithymia, the technical term for not being
able to identify what is going on inside oneself.16 People who suf fer from
alexithymia tend to feel physically uncomfortable but cannot describe
exactly what the problem is. As a result they often have multiple vague and
distressing physical complaints that doctors can’ t diagnose. In addition,
they can’ t figure out for themselves what they’re really feeling about any
given situation or what makes them feel better or worse. This is the result of
numbing, which keeps them from anticipating and responding to the
ordinary demands of their bodies in quiet, mindful ways. At the same time,
it muf fles the everyday sensory delights of experiences like music, touch,
and light, which imbue life with value. Y oga turned out to be a terrific way
to (re)gain a relationship with the interior world and with it a caring, loving,
sensual relationship to the self.
If you are not aware of what your body needs, you can’ t take care of it.
If you don’ t feel hunger , you can’ t nourish yourself. If you mistake anxiety
for hunger , you may eat too much. And if you can’ t feel when you’re
satiated, you’ll keep eating. This is why cultivating sensory awareness is
such a critical aspect of trauma recovery . Most traditional therapies
downplay or ignore the moment-to-moment shifts in our inner sensory
world. But these shifts carry the essence of the or ganism’ s responses: the
emotional states that are imprinted in the body’ s chemical profile, in the
viscera, in the contraction of the striated muscles of the face, throat, trunk,
and limbs.17 T raumatized people need to learn that they can tolerate their
sensations, befriend their inner experiences, and cultivate new action
patterns.
In yoga you focus your attention on your breathing and on your
sensations moment to moment. Y ou begin to notice the connection between
your emotions and your body—perhaps how anxiety about doing a pose
actually throws you of f balance. Y ou begin to experiment with changing the

way you feel. W ill taking a deep breath relieve that tension in your
shoulder? W ill focusing on your exhalations produce a sense of calm?18
Simply noticing what you feel fosters emotional regulation, and it helps
you to stop trying to ignore what is going on inside you. As I often tell my
students, the two most important phrases in therapy , as in yoga, are “Notice
that” and “What happens next?” Once you start approaching your body with
curiosity rather than with fear , everything shifts.
Body awareness also changes your sense of time. T rauma makes you
feel as if you are stuck forever in a helpless state of horror . In yoga you
learn that sensations rise to a peak and then fall. For example, if an
instructor invites you to enter a particularly challenging position, you may
at first feel a sense of defeat or resistance, anticipating that you won’ t be
able to tolerate the feelings brought up by this particular position. A good
yoga teacher will encourage you to just notice any tension while timing
what you feel with the flow of your breath: “W e’ll be holding this position
for ten breaths.” This helps you anticipate the end of discomfort and
strengthens your capacity to deal with physical and emotional distress.
A wareness that all experience is transitory changes your perspective on
yourself.
This is not to say that regaining interoception isn’ t potentially
upsetting. What happens when a newly accessed feeling in your chest is
experienced as rage, or fear , or anxiety? In our first yoga study we had a 50
percent dropout rate, the highest of any study we’d ever done. When we
interviewed the patients who’d left, we learned that they had found the
program too intense: Any posture that involved the pelvis could precipitate
intense panic or even flashbacks to sexual assaults. Intense physical
sensations unleashed the demons from the past that had been so carefully
kept in check by numbing and inattention. This taught us to go slow , often
at a snail’ s pace. That approach paid of f: In our most recent study only one
out of thirty-four participants did not finish.

Effects of a weekly yoga class.  After twenty weeks, chronically traumatized women
developed increased activation of critical brain structures involved in self-regulation: the insula
and the medial prefrontal cortex.
YOGA AND THE NEUROSCIENCE OF SELF-A W ARENESS
During the past few years brain researchers such as my colleagues Sara
Lazar and Britta Hölzel at Harvard have shown that intensive meditation
has a positive ef fect on exactly those brain areas that are critical for
physiological self-regulation.19 In our latest yoga study , with six women
with histories of profound early trauma, we also found the first indications
that twenty weeks of yoga practice increased activation of the basic self-
system, the insula and the medial prefrontal cortex (see chapter 6). This
research needs much more work, but it opens up new perspectives on how
actions that involve noticing and befriending the sensations in our bodies
can produce profound changes in both mind and brain that can lead to
healing from trauma.

After each of our yoga studies, we asked the participants what ef fect
the classes had had on them. W e never mentioned the insula or
interoception; in fact, we kept the discussion and explanation to a minimum
so that they could focus inward.
Here is a sample of their responses:
“My emotions feel more powerful. Maybe it’ s just that I can
recognize them now .”
“I can express my feelings more because I can recognize them
more. I feel them in my body , recognize them, and address
them.”
“I now see choices, multiple paths. I can decide and I can
choose my life, it doesn’ t have to be repeated or be experienced
like a child.”
“I was able to move my body and be in my body in a safe place
and without hurting myself/getting hurt.”
LEARNING T O COMMUNICA TE
People who feel safe in their bodies can begin to translate the memories that
previously overwhelmed them into language.  After Annie had been
practicing yoga three times a week for about a year , she noticed that she
was able to talk much more freely to me about what had happened to her .
She thought this almost miraculous. One day , when she knocked over a
glass of water , I got up from my chair and approached her with a Kleenex
box, saying, “Let me clean that up.” This precipitated a brief, intense panic
reaction. She was quickly able to contain herself, though, and explained
why those particular words were so upsetting to her—they were what her
father would say after he’d raped her . Annie wrote to me after that session:
“Did you notice that I have been able to say the words out loud? I didn’ t
have to write them down to tell you what was happening. I didn’ t lose trust
in you because you said words that triggered me. I understood that the
words were a trigger and not terrible words that no one should say .”
Annie continues to practice yoga and to write to me about her
experiences: “T oday I went to a morning yoga class at my new yoga studio.

The teacher talked about breathing to the edge of where we can and then
noticing that edge. She said that if we notice our breath we are in the
present because we can’ t breathe in the future or the past. It felt so amazing
to me to be practicing breathing in that way after we had just talked about
it, like I had been given a gift. Some of the poses can be triggering for me.
T wo of them were today , one where your legs are up frog like and one
where you are doing really deep breathing into your pelvis. I felt the
beginning of panic, especially in the breathing pose, like oh no that’ s not a
part of my body I want to feel. But then I was able to stop myself and just
say , notice that this part of your body is holding experiences and then just
let it go. Y ou don’ t have to stay there but you don’ t have to leave either , just
use it as information. I don’ t know that I have ever been able to do that in
such a conscious way before. It made me think that if I notice without being
so afraid, it will be easier for me to believe myself.”
In another message, Annie reflected on the changes in her life: “I
slowly learned to just have my feelings, without being hijacked by them.
Life is more manageable: I am more attuned to my day and more present in
the moment. I am more tolerant of physical touch. My husband and I are
enjoying watching movies cuddled together in bed . . . a huge step. All this
helped me finally feel intimate with my husband.”

A man has as many social selves as there are individuals who
recognize him.
—W illiam James, The Principles of Psychology
t was early in my career , and I had been seeing Mary , a shy , lonely , and
physically collapsed young woman, for about three months in weekly
psychotherapy , dealing with the ravages of her terrible history of early
abuse. One day I opened the door to my waiting room and saw her standing
there provocatively , dressed in a miniskirt, her hair dyed flaming red, with a
cup of cof fee in one hand and a snarl on her face. “Y ou must be Dr . van der
Kolk,” she said. “My name is Jane, and I came to warn you not to believe

any the lies that Mary has been telling you. Can I come in and tell you
about her?” I was stunned but fortunately kept myself from confronting
“Jane” and instead heard her out. Over the course of our session I met not
only Jane but also a hurt little girl and an angry male adolescent. That was
the beginning of a long and productive treatment.
Mary was my first encounter with  dissociative identity disorder (DID),
which at that time was called multiple personality disorder . As dramatic as
its symptoms are, the internal splitting and emer gence of distinct identities
experienced in DID represent only the extreme end of the spectrum of
mental life. The sense of being inhabited by warring impulses or parts is
common to all of us but particularly to traumatized people who had to resort
to extreme measures in order to survive. Exploring—even befriending—
those parts is an important component of healing.
DESPERA TE TIMES REQUIRE DESPERA TE MEASURES
W e all know what happens when we feel humiliated: W e put all our ener gy
into protecting ourselves, developing whatever survival strategies we can.
W e may repress our feelings; we may get furious and plot revenge. W e may
decide to become so powerful and successful that nobody can ever hurt us
again.  Many behaviors that are classified as psychiatric problems, including
some obsessions, compulsions, and panic attacks, as well as most self-
destructive behaviors, started out as strategies for self-protection. These
adaptations to trauma can so interfere with the capacity to function that
health-care providers and patients themselves often believe that full
recovery is beyond reach. V iewing these symptoms as permanent
disabilities narrows the focus of treatment to finding the proper drug
regimen, which can lead to lifelong dependence—as though trauma
survivors were like kidney patients on dialysis.1
It is much more productive to see aggression or depression, arrogance
or passivity as learned behaviors: Somewhere along the line, the patient
came to believe that he or she could survive only if he or she was tough,
invisible, or absent, or that it was safer to give up. Like traumatic memories
that keep intruding until they are laid to rest, traumatic adaptations continue

until the human or ganism feels safe and integrates all the parts of itself that
are stuck in fighting or warding of f the trauma.
Every trauma survivor I’ve met is resilient in his or her own way , and
every one of their stories inspires awe at how people cope. Knowing how
much ener gy the sheer act of survival requires keeps me from being
surprised at the price they often pay: the absence of a loving relationship
with their own bodies, minds, and souls.
Coping takes its toll. For many children it is safer to hate themselves
than to risk their relationship with their caregivers by expressing anger or
by running away . As a result, abused children are likely to grow up
believing that they are fundamentally unlovable; that  was the only way their
young minds could explain why they were treated so badly . They survive by
denying, ignoring, and splitting of f lar ge chunks of reality: They for get the
abuse; they suppress their rage or despair; they numb their physical
sensations. If you were abused as a child, you are likely to have a childlike
part living inside you that is frozen in time, still holding fast to this kind of
self-loathing and denial. Many adults who survive terrible experiences are
caught in the same trap. Pushing away intense feelings can be highly
adaptive in the short run. It may help you preserve your dignity and
independence; it may help you maintain focus on critical tasks like saving a
comrade, taking care of your kids, or rebuilding your house.
The problems come later . After seeing a friend blown up, a soldier may
return to civilian life and try to put the experience out of his mind. A
protective part of him knows how to be competent at his job and how to get
along with colleagues. But he may habitually erupt in rage at his girlfriend
or become numb and frozen when the pleasure of surrendering to her touch
makes him feel he is losing control. He probably will not be aware that his
mind automatically associates passive surrender with the paralysis he felt
when his friend was killed. So another protective part steps in to create a
diversion: He gets angry and, having no idea what set him of f, he thinks
he’ s mad about something his girlfriend did. Of course, if he keeps blowing
up at her (and subsequent girlfriends), he will become more and more
isolated. But he may never realize that a traumatized part is triggered by
passivity and that another part, an angry manager , is stepping in to protect
that vulnerable part. Helping these parts to give up their extreme beliefs is
how therapy can save people’ s lives.

As we saw in chapter 13, a central task for recovery from trauma is to
learn to live with the memories of the past without being overwhelmed by
them in the present. But most survivors, including those who are
functioning well—even brilliantly—in some aspects of their lives, face
another , even greater challenge: reconfiguring a brain/mind system that was
constructed to cope with the worst. Just as we need to revisit traumatic
memories in order to integrate them, we need to revisit the parts of
ourselves that developed the defensive habits that helped us to survive.
THE MIND IS A MOSAIC
W e all have parts. Right now a part of me feels like taking a nap; another
part wants to keep writing. Still feeling injured by an of fensive e-mail
message, a part of me wants to hit “reply” on a stinging put-down, while a
dif ferent part wants to shrug it of f. Most people who know me have seen
my intense, sincere, and irritable parts; some have met the little snarling
dog that lives inside me. My children reminisce about going on family
vacations with my playful and adventurous parts.
When you walk into the of fice in the morning and see the storm clouds
over your boss’ s head, you know precisely what is coming. That angry part
has a characteristic tone of voice, vocabulary , and body posture—so
dif ferent from yesterday , when you shared pictures of your kids. Parts are
not just feelings but distinct ways of being, with their own beliefs, agendas,
and roles in the overall ecology of our lives.
How well we get along with ourselves depends lar gely on our internal
leadership skills—how well we listen to our dif ferent parts, make sure they
feel taken care of, and keep them from sabotaging one another . Parts often
come across as absolutes when in fact they represent only one element in a
complex constellation of thoughts, emotions, and sensations. If Mar garet
shouts, “I hate you!” in the middle of an ar gument, Joe probably thinks she
despises him—and in that moment Mar garet might agree. But in fact only a
part of her is angry , and that part temporarily obscures her generous and
af fectionate feelings, which may well return when she sees the devastation
on Joe’ s face.

Every major school of psychology recognizes that people have
subpersonalities and gives them dif ferent names.2 In 1890 W illiam James
wrote: “[I]t must be admitted that . . . the total possible consciousness may
be split into parts which coexist, but mutually ignore each other , and share
the objects of knowledge between them.”3 Carl Jung wrote: “The psyche is
a self-regulating system that maintains its equilibrium just as the body
does,”4 “The natural state of the human psyche consists in a jostling
together of its components and in their contradictory behavior ,”5 and “The
reconciliation of these opposites is a major problem. Thus, the adversary is
none other than ‘the other in me.’”6
Modern neuroscience has confirmed this notion of the mind as a kind
of society . Michael Gazzaniga, who conducted pioneering split-brain
research, concluded that the mind is composed of semiautonomous
functioning modules, each of which has a special role.7 In his book The
Social Brain (1985) he writes, “But what of the idea that the self is not a
unified being, and there may exist within us several realms of
consciousness? . . . From our [split-brain] studies the new idea emer ges that
there are literally several selves, and they do not necessarily ‘converse’ with
each other internally .”8 MIT scientist Marvin Minsky , a pioneer of artificial
intelligence, declared: “The legend of the single Self can only divert us
from the tar get of that inquiry .9 . . . [I]t can make sense to think there exists,
inside your brain, a society of dif ferent minds. Like members of a family ,
the dif ferent minds can work together to help each other , each still having
its own mental experiences that the others never know about.”10
Therapists who are trained to see people as complex human beings with
multiple characteristics and potentialities can help them explore their
system of inner parts and take care of the wounded facets of themselves.
There are several such treatment approaches, including the structural
dissociation model developed by my Dutch colleagues Onno van der Hart
and Ellert Nijenhuis and Atlanta-based Kathy Steel, that is widely practiced
in Europe and Richard Kluft’ s work in the United States.1 1
T wenty years after working with Mary , I met Richard Schwartz, the
developer of internal family systems therapy (IFS). It was through his work
that Minsky’ s “family” metaphor truly came to life for me and of fered a
systematic way to work with the split-of f parts that result from trauma. At

the core of IFS is the notion that the mind of each of us is like a family in
which the members have dif ferent levels of maturity , excitability , wisdom,
and pain. The parts form a network or system in which change in any one
part will af fect all the others.
The IFS model helped me realize that dissociation occurs on a
continuum. In trauma the self-system breaks down, and parts of the self
become polarized and go to war with one another . Self-loathing coexists
(and fights) with grandiosity; loving care with hatred; numbing and
passivity with rage and aggression. These extreme parts bear the burden of
the trauma.
In IFS a part is considered not just a passing emotional state or
customary thought pattern but a distinct mental system with its own history ,
abilities, needs, and worldview .12 T rauma injects parts with beliefs and
emotions that hijack them out of their naturally valuable state. For example,
we all have parts that are childlike and fun. When we are abused, these are
the parts that are hurt the most, and they become frozen, carrying the pain,
terror , and betrayal of abuse. This burden makes them toxic—parts of
ourselves that we need to deny at all costs. Because they are locked away
inside, IFS calls them the exiles.
At this point other parts or ganize to protect the internal family from the
exiles. These protectors keep the toxic parts away , but in so doing they take
on some of the ener gy of the abuser . Critical and perfectionistic managers
can make sure we never get close to anyone or drive us to be relentlessly
productive. Another group of protectors, which IFS calls fir efighters , are
emer gency responders, acting impulsively whenever an experience triggers
an exiled emotion.
Each split-of f part holds dif ferent memories, beliefs, and physical
sensations; some hold the shame, others the rage, some the pleasure and
excitement, another the intense loneliness or the abject compliance. These
are all aspects of the abuse experience. The critical insight is that all these
parts have a function: to protect the self from feeling the full terror of
annihilation.
Children who act out their pain rather than locking it down are often
diagnosed with “oppositional defiant behavior ,” “attachment disorder ,” or
“conduct disorder .” But these labels ignore the fact that rage and

withdrawal are only facets of a whole range of desperate attempts at
survival. T rying to control a child’ s behavior while failing to address the
underlying issue—the abuse—leads to treatments that are inef fective at best
and harmful at worst. As they grow up, their parts do not spontaneously
integrate into a coherent personality but continue to lead a relatively
autonomous existence.
Parts that are “out” may be entirely unaware of the other parts of the
system.13 Most of the men I evaluated with regard to their childhood
molestation by Catholic priests took anabolic steroids and spent an
inordinate amount of time in the gym pumping iron. These compulsive
bodybuilders lived in a masculine culture of sweat, football, and beer ,
where weakness and fear were carefully concealed. Only after they felt safe
with me did I meet the terrified kids inside.
Patients may also dislike the parts that are out: the parts that are angry ,
destructive, or critical. But IFS of fers a framework for understanding them
—and, also important, talking about them in a nonpathologizing way .
Recognizing that each part is stuck with burdens from the past and
respecting its function in the overall system makes it feel less threatening or
overwhelming.
As Schwartz states: “If one accepts the basic idea that people have an
innate drive toward nurturing their own health, this implies that, when
people have chronic problems, something gets in the way of accessing inner
resources. Recognizing this, the role of therapists is to collaborate rather
than to teach, confront, or fill holes in your psyche.”14 The first step in this
collaboration is to assure the internal system that all parts are welcome and
that all of them—even those that are suicidal or destructive—were formed
in an attempt to protect the self-system, no matter how much they now
seem to threaten it.
SELF-LEADERSHIP
IFS recognizes that the cultivation of mindful self-leadership is the
foundation for healing from trauma. Mindfulness not only makes it possible
to survey our internal landscape with compassion and curiosity but can also
actively steer us in the right direction for self-care. All systems—families,

or ganizations, or nations—can operate ef fectively only if they have clearly
defined and competent leadership. The internal family is no dif ferent: All
facets of our selves need to be attended to. The internal leader must wisely
distribute the available resources and supply a vision for the whole that
takes all the parts into account.
As Richard Schwartz explains:
The internal system of an abuse victim differs fr om the non-abuse
system with r egar d to the consistent absence of effective
leadership, the extr eme rules under which the parts function, and
the absence of any consistent balance or harmony . T ypically , the
parts operate ar ound outdated assumptions and beliefs derived
fr om the childhood abuse, believing, for example, that it is still
extr emely danger ous to r eveal secr ets about childhood experiences
which wer e endur ed.15
What happens when the self is no longer in char ge? IFS calls this
“blending”: a condition in which the Self identifies with a part, as in “I want
to kill myself” or “I hate you.” Notice the dif ference from “A part of me
wishes that I were dead” or “A part of me gets triggered when you do that
and makes me want to kill you.”
Schwartz makes two assertions that extend the concept of mindfulness
into the realm of active leadership. The first is that this Self does not need
to be cultivated or developed. Beneath the surface of the protective parts of
trauma survivors there exists an undamaged essence, a Self that is
confident, curious, and calm, a Self that has been sheltered from destruction
by the various protectors that have emer ged in their ef forts to ensure
survival. Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the Self will
spontaneously emer ge, and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process.
The second assumption is that, rather than being a passive observer ,
this mindful Self can help reor ganize the inner system and communicate
with the parts in ways that help those parts trust that there is someone inside
who can handle things. Again neuroscience research shows that this is not
just a metaphor . Mindfulness increases activation of the medial prefrontal
cortex and decreases activation of structures like the amygdala that trigger

our emotional responses. This increases our control over the emotional
brain.
Even more than encouraging a relationship between a therapist and a
helpless patient, IFS focuses on cultivating an inner relationship between
the Self and the various protective parts. In this model of treatment the Self
doesn’ t only witness or passively observe, as in some meditation traditions;
it has an active leadership role. The Self is like an orchestra conductor who
helps all the parts to function harmoniously as a symphony rather than a
cacophony .
GETTING T O KNOW THE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE
The task of the therapist is to help patients separate this confusing blend
into separate entities, so that they are able to say: “This part of me is like a
little child, and that part of me is more mature but feels like a victim.” They
might not like many of these parts, but identifying them makes them less
intimidating or overwhelming. The next step is to encourage patients to
simply ask each protective part as it emer ges to “stand back” temporarily so
that we can see what it is protecting. When this is done again and again, the
parts begin to unblend from the Self and make space for mindful self-
observation. Patients learn to put their fear , rage, or disgust on hold and
open up into states of curiosity and self-reflection. From the stable
perspective of Self they can begin constructive inner dialogues with their
parts.
Patients are asked to identify the part involved in the current problem,
like feeling worthless, abandoned, or obsessed with vengeful thoughts. As
they ask themselves, “What inside me feels that way?” an image may come
to mind.16 Maybe the depressed part looks like an abandoned child, or an
aging man, or an overwhelmed nurse taking care of the wounded; a
vengeful part might appear as a combat marine or a member of a street
gang.
Next the therapist asks, “How do you feel toward that (sad, vengeful,
terrified) part of you?” This sets the stage for mindful self-observation by
separating the “you” from the part in question. If the patient has an extreme
response like “I hate it,” the therapist knows that there is another protective

part blended with Self. He or she might then ask, “See if the part that hates
it would step back.” Then the protective part is often thanked for its
vigilance and assured that it can return anytime that it is needed. If the
protective part is willing, the follow-up question is: “How do you feel
toward the (previously rejected) part now?” The patient is likely to say
something like “I wonder why it is so (sad, vengeful etc.).” This sets the
stage for getting to know the part better—for example, by inquiring how old
it is and how it came to feel the way it does.
Once a patient manifests a critical mass of Self, this kind of dialogue
begins to take place spontaneously . At this point it’ s important for the
therapist to step aside and just keep an eye out for other parts that might
interfere, or make occasional empathic comments, or ask questions like
“What do you say to the part about that?” or “Where do you want to go
now?” or “What feels like the right next step?” as well as the ubiquitous
Self-detecting question, “How do you feel toward the part now?”
A LIFE IN P AR TS
Joan came to see me to help her manage her uncontrollable temper tantrums
and to deal with her guilt about her numerous af fairs, most recently with her
tennis coach. As she put it in our first session: “I go from being a kick-ass
professional woman to a whimpering child, to a furious bitch, to a pitiless
eating machine in the course of ten minutes. I have no idea which of these I
really am.”
By this point in the session, Joan had already critiqued the prints on my
wall, my rickety furniture, and my messy desk. Of fense was her best
defense. She was preparing to get hurt again—I’d probably let her down, as
so many people had before. She knew that for therapy to work, she’d have
to make herself vulnerable, so she had to find out if I could tolerate her
anger , fear , and sorrow . I realized that the only way to counter her
defensiveness was by showing a high level of interest in the details of her
life, demonstrating unwavering support for the risk she took in talking with
me, and accepting the parts she was most ashamed of.
I asked Joan if she had noticed the part of herself that was critical. She
acknowledged that she had, and I asked her how she felt toward that critic.

This key question allowed her to begin to separate from that part and to
access her Self. Joan responded that she hated the critic, because it
reminded her of her mother . When I asked her what that critical part might
be protecting, her anger subsided, and she became more curious and
thoughtful: “I wonder why she finds it necessary to call me some of the
same names that my mother used to call me, and worse.” She talked about
how scared she had been of her mom growing up and how she felt that she
never could do anything right. The critic was obviously a manager: Not
only was it protecting Joan from me, but it was trying to preempt her
mother ’ s criticism.
Over the next few weeks Joan told me that she had been sexually
molested by her mother ’ s boyfriend, probably around the time she was in
the first or second grade. She thought she’d been “ruined” for intimate
relationships. While she was demanding and critical of her husband, for
whom she lacked any sexual desire, she was passionate and reckless in her
love af fairs. But the af fairs always ended in a similar way: In the middle of
a lovemaking session, she would suddenly become terrified and curl up into
a ball, whimpering like a little girl. These scenes left her confused and
disgusted, and afterward she could not bear to have anything more to do
with her lover .
Like Marilyn in chapter 8, Joan told me that she had learned to make
herself disappear when she was being molested, floating above the scene as
if it were happening to some other girl. Pushing the molestation out of her
mind had enabled Joan to have a normal school life of sleepovers,
girlfriends, and team sports. The trouble began in adolescence, when she
developed her pattern of frigid contempt for boys who treated her well and
having casual sex that left her humiliated and ashamed. She told me that
bulimia for her was what or gasms must be for other people, and having sex
with her husband for her was what vomiting must be for others. While
specific memories of her abuse were split of f (dissociated), she unwittingly
kept reenacting it.
I did not try to explain to her why she felt so angry , guilty , or shut down
—she already thought of herself as damaged goods. In therapy , as in
memory processing, pendulation—the gradual approach that I discussed in
chapter 13—is central. For Joan to be able to deal with her misery and hurt,

we would have to recruit her own strength and self-love, enabling her to
heal herself.
This meant focusing on her many inner resources and reminding myself
that I could not provide her with the love and caring she had missed as a
child. If, as a therapist, teacher , or mentor , you try to fill the holes of early
deprivation, you come up against the fact that you are the wrong person, at
the wrong time, in the wrong place. The therapy would focus on Joan’ s
relationship with her parts rather than with me.
MEETING THE MANAGERS
As Joan’ s treatment progressed, we identified many dif ferent parts that were
in char ge at dif ferent times: an aggressive childlike part that threw tantrums,
a promiscuous adolescent part, a suicidal part, an obsessive manager , a
prissy moralist, and so on. As usual, we met the managers first. Their job
was to prevent humiliation and abandonment and to keep her or ganized and
safe. Some managers may be aggressive, like Joan’ s critic, while others are
perfectionistic or reserved, careful not to draw too much attention to
themselves. They may tell us to turn a blind eye to what is going on and
keep us passive to avoid risk. Internal managers also control how much
access we have to emotions, so that the self-system doesn’ t get
overwhelmed.
It requires an enormous amount of ener gy to keep the system under
control. A single flirtatious comment may trigger several parts
simultaneously: one that becomes intensely sexually aroused, another filled
with self-loathing, a third that tries to calm things down by self-cutting.
Other managers create obsessions and distractions or deny reality
altogether . But each part should be approached as an internal protector who
maintains an important defensive position. Managers carry huge burdens of
responsibility and usually are in over their heads.
Some managers are extremely competent. Many of my patients hold
responsible positions, do outstanding professional jobs, and can be superbly
attentive parents. Joan’ s critical manager undoubtedly contributed to her
success as an ophthalmologist. I have had numerous patients who were
highly skilled teachers or nurses. While their colleagues may have

experienced them as a bit distant or reserved, they would probably have
been astonished to discover that their exemplary coworkers engaged in self-
mutilation, eating disorders, or bizarre sexual practices.
Gradually Joan started to realize that it is normal to simultaneously
experience conflicting feelings or thoughts, which gave her more
confidence to face the task ahead. Instead of believing that hate consumed
her entire being, she learned that only a part of her felt paralyzed by it.
However , after a negative evaluation at work Joan went into a tailspin,
berating herself for not protecting herself, then feeling clingy , weak, and
powerless. When I asked her to see where that powerless part was located
in her body and how she felt toward it, she resisted. She told me she
couldn’ t stand that whiny , incompetent girl who made her feel embarrassed
and contemptuous of herself. I suspected that this part held much of the
memory of her abuse, and I decided not to pressure her at this point. She
left my of fice withdrawn and upset.
The next day she raided the refrigerator and then spent hours vomiting
up her food. When she returned to my of fice, she told me she wanted to kill
herself and was surprised that I seemed genuinely curious and
nonjudgmental and that I did not condemn her for either her bulimia or her
suicidality . When I asked her what parts were involved, the critic came back
and blurted out, “She is disgusting.” When she asked that part to step back,
the next part said: “Nobody will ever love me,” followed again by the critic,
who told me that the best way to help her would be to ignore all that noise
and to increase her medications.
Clearly , in their desire to protect her injured parts, these managers were
unintentionally doing her harm. So I kept asking them what they thought
would happen if they stepped back. Joan answered: “People will hate me”
and “I will be all alone and out in the street.” This was followed by a
memory: Her mother had told her that if she disobeyed, she would be put up
for adoption and never see her sisters or her dog again. When I asked her
how she felt about that scared girl inside, she cried and said that she felt bad
for her . Now her Self was back, and I was confident that we had calmed the
system down, but this session turned out to be too much too soon.
PUTTING OUT THE FLAMES

The following week Joan missed her appointment. W e had triggered her
exiles, and her firefighters went on a rampage. As she told me later , the
evening after we talked about her terror of being put into foster care, she
felt as if she were going to blast out of herself. She went to a bar and picked
up a guy . Coming home late, drunk, and disheveled, she refused to talk to
her husband and fell asleep in the den. The next morning she acted as if
nothing had happened.
Firefighters will do anything to make emotional pain go away . Aside
from sharing the task of keeping the exiles locked up, they are the opposite
of managers: Managers are all about staying in control, while firefighters
will destroy the house in order to extinguish the fire. The struggle between
uptight managers and out-of-control firefighters will continue until the
exiles, which carry the burden of the trauma, are allowed to come home and
be cared for .
Anyone who deals with survivors will encounter those firefighters. I’ve
met firefighters who shop, drink, play computer games addictively , have
impulsive af fairs, or exercise compulsively . A sordid encounter can blunt
the abused child’ s horror and shame, if only for a couple of hours.
It is critical to remember that, at their core, firefighters are also
desperately trying to protect the system. Unlike managers, who are usually
superficially cooperative during therapy , firefighters don’ t hold back: They
hurl insults and storm out of the room. Firefighters are frantic, and if you
ask them what would happen if they stopped doing their job, you discover
that they believe the exiled feelings would crash the entire self-system.
They are also oblivious to the idea that there are better ways to guarantee
physical and emotional safety , and even if behaviors like bingeing or
cutting stop, firefighters often find other methods of self-harm. These
cycles will come to an end only when the Self is able to take char ge and the
system feels safe.
THE BURDEN OF T OXICITY
Exiles are the toxic waste dump of the system. Because they hold the
memories, sensations, beliefs, and emotions associated with trauma, it is
hazardous to release them. They contain the “Oh, my God, I’m done for”

experience—the essence of inescapable shock—and with it, terror , collapse,
and accommodation. Exiles may reveal themselves in the form of crushing
physical sensations or extreme numbing, and they of fend both the
reasonableness of the managers and the bravado of the firefighters.
Like most incest survivors, Joan hated her exiles, particularly the little
girl who had responded to her abuser ’ s sexual demands and the terrified
child who whimpered alone in her bed. When exiles overwhelm managers,
they take us over—we are nothing but that rejected, weak, unloved, and
abandoned child. The Self becomes “blended” with the exiles, and every
possible alternative for our life is eclipsed. Then, as Schwartz points out,
“W e see ourselves, and the world, through their eyes and believe it is ‘the’
world. In this state it won’ t occur to us that we have been hijacked.”17
Keeping the exiles locked up, however , stamps out not only memories
and emotions but also the parts that hold them—the parts that were hurt the
most by the trauma. In Schwartz’ s words: “Usually those are your most
sensitive, creative, intimacy-loving, lively , playful and innocent parts. By
exiling them when they get hurt, they suf fer a double whammy—the insult
of your rejection is added to their original injury .”18 As  Joan discovered,
keeping the exiles hidden and despised was condemning her to a life
without intimacy or genuine joy .
UNLOCKING THE P AST
Several months into Joan’ s treatment we again accessed the exiled girl who
carried the humiliation, confusion, and shame of Joan’ s molestation. By
then she had come to trust me enough and had developed enough sense of
Self to be able to tolerate observing herself as a child, with all her long-
buried feelings of terror , excitement, surrender , and complicity . She did not
say very much during this process, and my main job was to keep her in a
state of calm self-observation. She often had the impulse to pull away in
disgust and horror , leaving this unacceptable child alone in her misery . At
these points I asked her protectors to step back so that she could keep
listening to what her little girl wanted her to know .
Finally , with my encouragement, she was able to rush into the scene
and take the girl away with her to a safe place. She firmly told her abuser

that she would never let him get close to her again. Instead of denying the
child, she played an active role in liberating her . As in EMDR the resolution
of the trauma was the result of her ability to access her imagination and
rework the scenes in which she had become frozen so long ago. Helpless
passivity was replaced by determined Self-led action.
Once Joan started to own her impulses and behaviors, she recognized
the emptiness of her relationship with her husband, Brian, and began to
insist on change. I invited her to ask Brian to meet with us, and she was
present for eight sessions before he began to see me individually .
Schwartz observes that IFS can help family members “mentor” each
other as they learn to observe how one person’ s parts interact with
another ’ s. I witnessed this firsthand with Joan and Brian. Brian was initially
quite proud of having put up with Joan’ s behavior for so long; feeling that
she really needed him had kept him from even considering divorce. But
now that she wanted more intimacy , he felt pressured and inadequate—
revealing a panicked part that blanked out and put up a wall against feeling.
Gradually Brian began to talk about growing up in an alcoholic family
where behaviors like Joan’ s were common and lar gely ignored, punctuated
by his father ’ s stays in detox centers and his mother ’ s long hospitalizations
for depression and suicide attempts. When I asked his panicked part what
would happen if it allowed Brian to feel anything, he revealed his fear of
being overwhelmed by pain—the pain of his childhood added to the pain of
his relationship with Joan.
Over the next few weeks other parts emer ged. First came a protector
that was frightened of women and determined never to let Brian become
vulnerable to their manipulations. Then we discovered a strong caretaker
part that had looked after his mother and his younger siblings. This part
gave Brian a feeling of self-worth and purpose and a way of dealing with
his own terror . Finally , Brian was ready to meet his exile, the scared,
essentially motherless child who’d had no one to care for him.
This is a very short version of a long exploration, which involved many
diversions, as when Joan’ s critic reemer ged from time to time. But from the
beginning IFS helped Joan and Brian hear themselves and each other from
the perspective of an objective, curious, and compassionate Self. They were
no longer locked in the past, and a whole range of new possibilities opened
up for them.

THE POWER OF SELF-COMP ASSION: IFS IN THE
TREA TMENT OF RHEUMA T OID AR THRITIS
Nancy Shadick is a rheumatologist at Boston’ s Brigham and W omen’ s
Hospital who combines medical research on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with
a strong interest in her patients’ personal experience of their illness. When
she discovered IFS at a workshop with Richard Schwartz, she decided to
incorporate the therapy into a study of psychosocial intervention with RA
patients.
RA is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammatory disorders
throughout the body , causing chronic pain and disability . Medication can
delay its progress and relieve some of the pain, but there is no cure, and
living with RA can lead to depression, anxiety , isolation, and overall
impaired quality of life. I followed this study with particular interest
because of the link I’d observed between trauma and autoimmune disease.
W orking with senior IFS therapist Nancy Sowell, Dr . Shadick created a
nine-month randomized study in which one group of RA patients would
receive both group and individual instruction in IFS while a control group
received regular mailings and phone calls regarding disease symptoms and
management. Both groups continued with their regular medications, and
they were assessed periodically by rheumatologists who were not informed
which group they belonged to.
The goal of the IFS group was to teach patients how to accept and
understand their inevitable fear , hopelessness, and anger and to treat those
feelings as members of their own “internal family .” They would learn the
inner dialogue skills that would enable them to recognize their pain,
identify the accompanying thoughts and emotions, and then approach these
internal states with interest and compassion.
A basic problem emer ged early . Like so many trauma survivors, the RA
patients were alexithymic. As Nancy Sowell later told me, they never
complained about their pain or disability unless they were totally
overwhelmed. Asked how they were feeling, they almost always replied,
“I’m fine.” Their stoic parts clearly helped them cope, but these managers
also kept them in a state of denial. Some shut out their bodily sensations
and emotions to the extent that they could not collaborate ef fectively with
their doctors.

T o get things moving, the leaders introduced the IFS parts dramatically ,
rearranging furniture and props to represent managers, exiles, and
firefighters. Over the course of several weeks, group members began to talk
about the managers who told them to “grin and bear it” because no one
wanted to hear about their pain anyway . Then, as they asked the stoic parts
to step back, they started to acknowledge the angry part that wanted to yell
and wreak havoc, the part that wanted stay in bed all the time, and the exile
who felt worthless because she wasn’ t allowed to talk. It emer ged that, as
children, nearly all of them were supposed to be seen and not heard—safety
meant keeping their needs under wraps.
Individual IFS therapy helped patients apply the language of parts to
daily issues. For example, one woman felt trapped by conflicts at her job,
where a manager part insisted the only way out was to overwork until her
RA flared up. W ith the therapist’ s help she realized that she could care for
her needs without making herself sick.
The two groups, IFS and controls, were evaluated three times during
the nine-month study period and then again one year later . At the end of
nine months, the IFS group showed measurable improvements in self-
assessed joint pain, physical function, self-compassion, and overall pain
relative to the education group. They also showed significant improvements
in depression and self-ef ficacy . The IFS group’ s gains in pain perception
and depressive symptoms were sustained one year later , although objective
medical tests could no longer detect measurable improvements in pain or
function. In other words, what had changed most was the patients’ ability to
live with their disease. In their conclusions, Shadick and Sowell
emphasized IFS’ s focus on self-compassion as a key factor .
This was not the first study to show that psychological interventions
can help RA patients. Cognitive behavioral therapies and mindfulness-
based practices have also been shown to have a positive impact on pain,
joint inflammation, physical disability , and depression.19 However , none of
these studies has asked a crucial question: Are increased psychological
safety and comfort reflected in a better -functioning immune system?
LIBERA TING THE EXILED CHILD

Peter ran an oncology service at a prestigious academic medical center that
was consistently rated as one of the best in the country . As he sat in my
of fice, in perfect physical shape because of his regular squash practice, his
confidence had crossed the line into arrogance. This man certainly did not
seem to suf fer from PTSD. He told me he just wanted to know how he
could help his wife to be less “touchy .” She had threatened to leave him
unless he did something about what she termed his callous behavior . Peter
assured me that her perception was warped, because he obviously had no
problem being empathic with sick people.
He loved talking about his work, proud of the fact that residents and
fellows competed fiercely to be on his service and also of scuttlebutt he’d
heard about his staf f being terrified of him. He described himself as brutally
honest, a real scientist, someone who just looked at the facts and—with a
meaningful glance in my direction—did not suf fer fools gladly . He had high
standards, but no higher than he had for himself, and he assured me that he
didn’ t need anybody’ s love, just their respect.
Peter also told me that his psychiatry rotation in med school had
convinced him that psychiatrists still practiced witchcraft, and his one stint
in couples’ therapy had further confirmed that opinion. He expressed
contempt for people who blamed their parents or society for their problems.
Even though he had had his own share of misery as a child, he was
determined never to think of himself as a victim.
While Peter ’ s toughness and his love for precision appealed to me, I
could not help but wonder if we would discover something I’d seen all too
often: that internal managers who are obsessed with power are usually
created as a bulwark against feeling helpless.
When I asked him about his family , Peter told me that his father ran a
manufacturing business. He was a Holocaust survivor who could be brutal
and exacting, but he also had a tender and sentimental side that had kept
Peter connected with him and that had inspired Peter to become a physician.
As he told me about his mother , he realized for the first time that she had
substituted rigorous housekeeping for genuine care, but Peter denied that
this bothered him. He went to school and got straight As. He had vowed to
build a life free of rejection and humiliation, but, ironically , he lived with
death and rejection every day—death on the oncology ward and the
constant struggle to get his research funded and published.

Peter ’ s wife joined us for the next meeting. She described how he
criticized her incessantly—her taste in clothes, her child-rearing practices,
her reading habits, her intelligence, her friends. He was rarely at home and
never emotionally available. Because he had so many important obligations,
and because he was so explosive, his family always tiptoed around him. She
was determined to leave him and start a new life unless he made some
radical changes. At that point, for the first time, I saw Peter become
obviously distressed. He assured me and his wife that he wanted to work
things out.
At our next session I asked him to let his body relax, close his eyes,
focus his attention inside, and ask that critical part—the one his wife had
identified — what it was afraid would happen if he stopped his ruthless
judging. After about thirty seconds he said he felt stupid talking to himself.
He didn’ t want to try some new age gimmick—he’d come to me looking for
“empirically verified therapy .” I assured him that, like him, I was at the
forefront of empirically based therapies and that this was one of them. He
was silent for perhaps a minute before he whispered: “I would get hurt.” I
ur ged him to ask the critic what that meant. Still with his eyes closed, Peter
replied: “If you criticize others, they don’ t dare to hurt you.” Then: “If you
are perfect, nobody can criticize you.” I asked him to thank his critic for
protecting him against hurt and humiliation, and as he became silent again,
I could see his shoulders relax and his breathing become slower and deeper .
He next told me that he was aware that his pomposity was af fecting his
relationships with his colleagues and students; he felt lonely and despised
during staf f meetings and uncomfortable at hospital parties. When I asked
him if he wanted to change the way that angry part threatened people, he
replied that he did. I then asked him where it was located in his body , and
he found it in the middle of his chest. Keeping his focus inside, I asked him
how he felt toward it. He said it made him scared.
Next I asked him to stay focused on it and see how he felt toward it
now . He said he was curious to know more about it. I asked him how old it
was. He said about seven. I asked him to have his critic show him what he
protected. After a lengthy silence, still with his eyes closed, he told me that
he was witnessing a scene from his childhood. His father was beating a
little boy , him, and he was standing to one side thinking how stupid that kid
was to provoke his dad. When I asked him how he felt about the boy who

was getting hurt, he told me that he despised him. He was a weakling and a
whiner; after showing even the least bit of defiance to his dad’ s high-
handed ways, he inevitably capitulated and whimpered that he would be a
good little boy . He had no guts, no fire in his belly . I asked the critic if he
would be willing to step aside so we could see what was going on with that
boy . In response the critic appeared in full force and called him names like
“wimp” and “sissy .” I asked Peter again if the critic would be willing to step
aside and give the boy a chance to speak. He shut down completely and left
the session saying that he was unlikely ever to set foot in my of fice again.
But the following week he was back: As she had threatened, his wife
had gone to a lawyer and filed for divorce. He was devastated and no longer
looked anything like the perfectly put-together doctor whom I’d come to
know and, in many ways, dread. Faced with the loss of his family , he
became unhinged and felt comforted by the idea that if things got too bad
he could take his life in his own hands.
W e went inside again and identified the part that was terrified of
abandonment. Once he was in his mindful Self-state, I ur ged him to ask that
terrified boy to show him the burdens he was carrying. Again, his first
reaction was disgust at the boy’ s weakness, but after I asked him to get that
part to step back, he saw an image of himself as a young boy in his parents’
house, alone in his room, screaming in terror . Peter watched this scene for
several minutes, weeping silently through much of it. I asked him if the boy
had told him everything he wanted him to know . No, there were other
scenes, like running to embrace his father at the door and getting slapped
for having disobeyed his mother .
From time to time he would interrupt the process by explaining why his
parents couldn’ t have done any better than they had, their being Holocaust
survivors and all that implied. Again I suggested he find the protective parts
that were interrupting the witnessing of the boy’ s pain and request that they
move temporarily to another room. And each time he was able to return to
his grief.
I asked Peter to tell the boy that he now understood how bad the
experience had been. He sat in a long, sad silence. Then I asked him to
show the boy that he cared about him. After some coaxing he put his arms
around the boy . I was surprised that this seemingly harsh and callous man
knew exactly how to take care of him.

Then, after some time, I ur ged Peter to go back into the scene and take
the boy away with him. Peter imagined himself confronting his dad as a
grown man, telling him: “If you ever mess with that boy again, I’ll come
and kill you.” He then, in his imagination, took the child to a beautiful
campground he knew , where the boy could play and frolic with ponies
while he watched over him.
Our work was not done. After his wife rescinded her threat of divorce,
some of his old habits returned, and we had to revisit that isolated boy from
time to time to make sure that Peter ’ s wounded parts were taken care of,
especially when he felt hurt by something that happened at home or on the
job. This is the stage IFS calls “unburdening,” and it corresponds to nursing
those exiled parts back to health. W ith each new unburdening Peter ’ s once-
scathing inner critic relaxed, as little by little it became more like a mentor
than a judge, and he began to repair his relationships with his family and
colleagues. He also stopped suf fering from tension headaches.
One day he told me that he’d spent his adulthood trying to let go of his
past, and he remarked how ironic it was that he had to get closer to it in
order to let it go.

The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can
alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.
—W illiam James
It is not that something dif ferent is seen, but that one sees
dif ferently . It is as though the spatial act of seeing were changed by
a new dimension.
—Carl Jung
t is one thing to process memories of trauma, but it is an entirely dif ferent
matter to confront the inner void—the holes in the soul that result from
not having been wanted, not having been seen, and not having been allowed
to speak the truth. If your parents’ faces never lit up when they looked at
you, it’ s hard to know what it feels like to be loved and cherished. If you
come from an incomprehensible world filled with secrecy and fear , it’ s
almost impossible to find the words to express what you have endured. If
you grew up unwanted and ignored, it is a major challenge to develop a
visceral sense of agency and self-worth.
The research that Judy Herman, Chris Perry , and I had done (see
chapter 9) showed that people who felt unwanted as children, and those

who did not remember feeling safe with anyone while growing up, did not
fully benefit from conventional psychotherapy , presumably because they
could not activate old traces of feeling cared for .
I could see this even in some of my most committed and articulate
patients. Despite their hard work in therapy and their share of personal and
professional accomplishments,  they could not erase the devastating imprints
of a mother who was too depressed to notice them or a father who treated
them like he wished they’d never been born. It was clear that their lives
would change fundamentally only if they could reconstruct those implicit
maps. But how?  How can we help people become viscerally acquainted
with feelings that were lacking early in their lives?
I glimpsed a possible answer when I attended the founding conference
of the United States Association for Body Psychotherapy in June 1994 at a
small college in Beverley on the rocky Massachusetts coast. Ironically , I
had been asked to represent mainstream psychiatry at the meeting and to
speak on using brain scans to visualize mental states. But as soon as I
walked into the lobby where attendees had gathered for morning cof fee, I
realized this was a dif ferent crowd from my usual psychopharmacology or
psychotherapy gatherings. The way they talked to one another , their
postures and gestures, radiated vitality and engagement—the sort of
physical reciprocity that is the essence of attunement.
I soon struck up a conversation with Albert Pesso, a stocky former
dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company who was then in his early
seventies. Underneath his bushy eyebrows he exuded kindness and
confidence. He told me that he had found a way of fundamentally changing
people’ s relationship to their core, somatic selves. His enthusiasm was
infectious, but I was skeptical and asked him if he was certain he could
change the settings of the amygdala. Unfazed by the fact that nobody had
ever tested his method scientifically , he confidently assured me that he
could.
Pesso was about to conduct a workshop in “PBSP psychomotor
therapy ,”1 and he invited me to attend. It was unlike any group work I had
ever seen. He took a low chair opposite a woman named Nancy , whom he
called a “protagonist,” with the other participants seated on pillows around
them. He then invited Nancy to talk about what was troubling her ,

occasionally using her pauses to “witness” what he was observing—as in
“A witness can see how crestfallen you are when you talk about your father
deserting the family .” I was impressed by how carefully he tracked subtle
shifts in body posture, facial expression, tone of voice, and eye gaze, the
nonverbal expressions of emotion. (This is called “microtracking” in
psychomotor therapy).
Each time Pesso made a “witness statement,” Nancy’ s face and body
relaxed a bit, as if she felt comforted by being seen and validated. His quiet
comments seemed to bolster her courage to continue and go deeper . When
Nancy started to cry , he observed that nobody should have to bear so much
pain all by herself, and he asked if she would like to choose someone to sit
next to her .  (He called this a “contact person.”) Nancy nodded and, after
carefully scanning the room, pointed to a kind-looking middle-aged woman.
Pesso asked Nancy where she would like her contact person to sit. “Right
here,” Nancy said decisively , indicating a pillow immediately to her right.
I was fascinated. People process spatial relations with the right
hemisphere of the brain, and our neuroimaging research had shown that the
imprint of trauma is principally on the right hemisphere as well (see chapter
3). Caring, disapproval, and indif ference all are primarily conveyed by
facial expression, tone of voice, and physical movements. According to
recent research, up to 90 percent of human communication occurs in the
nonverbal, right-hemisphere realm,2 and this was where Pesso’ s work
seemed primarily to be directed. As the workshop went on, I was also
struck by how the contact person’ s presence seemed to help Nancy tolerate
the painful experiences she was dredging up.3
But what was most unusual was how Pesso created tableaus—or as he
called them, “structures”—of the protagonists’ past. As the narratives
unfolded, group participants were asked to play the roles of significant
people in the protagonists’ lives, such as parents and other family members,
so that their inner world began to take form in three-dimensional space.
Group members were also enlisted to play the ideal, wished-for parents who
would provide the support, love, and protection that had been lacking at
critical moments. Protagonists became the directors of their own plays,
creating around them the past they never had, and they clearly experienced
profound physical and mental relief after these imaginary scenarios. Could

this technique instill imprints of safety and comfort alongside those of terror
and abandonment, decades after the original shaping of mind and brain?
Intrigued with the promise of Pesso’ s work, I eagerly accepted his
invitation to visit his hilltop farmhouse in southern New Hampshire. After
lunch beneath an ancient oak tree, Al asked me to join him in his red
clapboard barn, now a studio, to do a structure. I’d spent several years in
psychoanalysis, so I did not expect any major revelations. I was a settled
professional man in my forties with my own family , and I thought of my
parents as two elderly people who were trying to create a decent old age for
themselves. I certainly did not think they still had a major influence on me.
Since there were no other people available for role-play , Al began by
asking me to select an object or a piece of furniture to represent my father . I
chose a gigantic black leather couch and asked Al to put it upright about
eight feet in front of me, slightly to the left. Then he asked if I’d like to
bring my mother into the room as well, and I chose a heavy lamp,
approximately the same height as the upright couch. As the session
continued, the space became populated with the important people in my
life: my best friend, a tiny Kleenex box to my right; my wife, a small pillow
next to him; my two children, two more tiny pillows.
After a while I surveyed the projection of my internal landscape: two
hulking, dark, and threatening objects representing my parents and an array
of minuscule objects representing my wife, children, and friends. I was
astounded; I had re-created my inner image of my stern Calvinistic parents
from the time I was a little boy . My chest felt tight, and I’m sure that my
voice sounded even tighter . I could not deny what my spatial brain was
revealing: The structure had allowed me to visualize my implicit map of the
world.
When I told Al what I had just uncovered, he nodded and asked if I
would allow him to change my perspective. I felt my skepticism return, but
I liked Al and was curious about his method, so I hesitantly agreed. He then
interposed his body directly between me and the couch and lamp, making
them disappear from my line of sight. Instantaneously I felt a deep release
in my body—the constriction in my chest eased and my breathing became
relaxed. That was the moment I decided to become Pesso’ s student.4

RESTRUCTURING INNER MAPS
Projecting your inner world into the three-dimensional space of a structure
enables you to see what’ s happening in the theater of your mind and gives
you a much clearer perspective on your reactions to people and events in
the past. As you position placeholders for the important people in your life,
you may be surprised by the unexpected memories, thoughts, and emotions
that come up. Y ou then can experiment with moving the pieces around on
the external chessboard that you’ve created and see what ef fect it has on
you.
Although the structures involve dialogue, psychomotor therapy does
not explain or interpret the past. Instead, it allows you to feel what you felt
back then, to visualize what you saw , and to say what you could not say
when it actually happened. It’ s as if you could go back into the movie of
your life and rewrite the crucial scenes.  Y ou can direct the role-players to
do things they failed to do in the past, such as keeping your father from
beating up your mom. These tableaus can stimulate powerful emotions. For
example, as you place your “real mother” in the corner , cowering in terror ,
you may feel a deep longing  to protect her and realize how powerless you
felt as a child. But if you then create an ideal mother , who stands up to your
father and who knows how to avoid getting trapped in abusive
relationships , you may experience a visceral sense of relief and an
unburdening of that old guilt and helplessness. Or you might confront the
brother who brutalized you as a child and then create an ideal brother who
protects you and becomes your role model.
The job of the director / therapist and other group members is to provide
protagonists with the support they need to delve into whatever they have
been too afraid to explore on their own. The safety of the group allows you
to notice things that you have hidden from yourself—usually the things you
are most ashamed of. When you no longer have to hide, the structure allows
you to place the shame where it belongs—on the figures right in front of
you who represent those who hurt you and made you feel helpless as a
child.
Feeling safe means you can say things to your father (or , rather , the
placeholder who represents him) that you wish you could have said as a
five-year -old. Y ou can tell the placeholder for your depressed and

frightened mother how terrible you felt about not being able to take care of
her . Y ou can experiment with distance and proximity and explore what
happens as you move placeholders around. As an active participant, you can
lose yourself in a scene in a way you cannot when you simply tell a story .
And as you take char ge of representing the reality of your experience, the
witness keeps you company , reflecting the changes in your posture, facial
expression, and tone of voice.
In my experience, physically reexperiencing the past in the present and
then reworking it in a safe and supportive “container” can be powerful
enough to create new , supplemental memories: simulated experiences of
growing up in an attuned, af fectionate setting where you are protected from
harm. Structures do not erase bad memories, or even neutralize them the
way EMDR does. Instead, a structure of fers fresh options—an alternative
memory in which your basic human needs are met and your longings for
love and protection are fulfilled.
REVISING THE P AST
Let me give an example from a workshop I led not long ago at the Esalen
Institute in Big Sur , California.
Maria was a slender , athletic Filipina in her midforties who had been
pleasant and accommodating during our first two days, which had been
devoted to exploring the long-term impact of trauma  and teaching self-
regulation techniques. But now , seated on her pillow about six feet away
from me, she looked scared and collapsed. I wondered to myself if she had
volunteered as a protagonist mainly to please the girlfriend who had
accompanied her to the workshop.
I began by encouraging her to notice what was going on inside her and
to share whatever came to mind. After a long silence she said: “I can’ t
really feel anything in my body , and my mind is blank.” Mirroring her inner
tension, I replied: “A witness can see how worried you are that your mind is
blank and you don’ t feel anything after volunteering to do a structure. Is
that right?” “Y es!” she answered, sounding slightly relieved.
The “witness figure” enters the structure at the very beginning and
takes the role of an accepting, nonjudgmental observer who joins the

protagonist by reflecting his or her emotional state and noting the context in
which that state has emer ged (as when I mentioned Maria’ s “volunteering to
do a structure”). Being validated by feeling heard and seen is a precondition
for feeling safe, which is critical when we explore the dangerous territory of
trauma and abandonment. A neuroimaging study has shown that when
people hear a statement that mirrors their inner state, the right amygdala
momentarily lights up, as if to underline the accuracy of the reflection.
I encouraged Maria to keep focusing on her breath, one of the exercises
we had been practicing together , and to notice what she was feeling in her
body . After another long silence she hesitantly began to speak: “There is
always a sense of fear in everything I do. It doesn’ t look like I am afraid,
but I am always pushing myself. It is really dif ficult for me to be up here.” I
reflected, “A witness can see how uncomfortable you feel pushing yourself
to be here,” and she nodded, slightly straightening her spine, signaling that
she felt understood. She continued: “I grew up thinking that my family was
normal. But I always was terrified of my dad. I never felt cared for by him.
He never hit me as hard as he did my siblings, but I have a pervasive sense
of fear .” I noted that a witness could see how afraid she looked as she spoke
of her father , and then I invited her to select a group member to represent
him.
Maria scanned the room and chose Scott, a gentle video producer who
had been a lively and supportive member of the group. I gave Scott his
script: “I enroll as your real father , who terrified you when you were a little
girl,” which he repeated. (Note that this work is not about improvisation but
about accurately enacting the dialogue and directions provided by the
witness and protagonist.) I then asked Maria where she would like her real
father to be positioned, and she instructed Scott to stand about twelve feet
away , slightly to her right and facing away from her . W e were beginning to
create the tableau, and every time I conduct a structure I’m impressed by
how precise the outward projections of the right hemisphere are.
Protagonists always know exactly where the various characters in their
structures should be located.
It also surprises me, again and again, how the placeholders representing
the significant people in the protagonist’ s past almost immediately assume a
virtual reality: The people who enroll seem to become the people he or she
had to deal with back then—not only to the protagonist but often to the

other participants as well. I encouraged Maria to take a good, long look at
her real father , and as she gazed at him standing there, we could witness
how her emotions shifted between terror and a deep sense of compassion
for him. She tearfully reflected on how dif ficult his life had been—how , as
a child during W orld W ar II, he had seen people beheaded; how he had been
forced to eat rotten fish infested with maggots. Structures promote one of
the essential conditions for deep therapeutic change: a trancelike state in
which multiple realities can live side by side—past and present, knowing
that you’re an adult while feeling the way you did as a child, expressing
your rage or terror to someone who feels like your abuser while being fully
aware that you are talking to Scott, who is nothing like your real father , and
experiencing simultaneously the complex emotions of loyalty , tenderness,
rage, and longing that kids feel with their parents.
As Maria began to speak about their relationship when she was a little
girl, I continued to mirror her expressions. Her father had brutalized her
mother , she said. He was relentlessly critical of her diet, her body , her
housekeeping, and she was always afraid for her mother when he berated
her . Maria described her mother as loving and warm; she could not have
survived without her . She would always be there to comfort Maria after her
father lashed out at her , but she didn’ t do anything to protect her children
from their father ’ s rage. “I think my mom had a lot of fear herself. I have a
sense that she didn’ t protect us because she felt trapped.”
At this point I suggested that it was time to call Maria’ s real mother
into the room. Maria scanned the group and smiled brightly as she asked
Kristin, a blonde, Scandinavian-looking artist, to play the part of her real
mother . Kristin accepted in the formal words of the structure: “I enroll as
your real mother , who was warm and loving and without whom you would
not have survived but who failed to protect you from your abusive father .”
Maria had her sit on a pillow to her right, much closer than her real father .
I encouraged Maria to look at Kristin and then I asked, “So what
happens when you look at her?” Maria angrily said, “Nothing.” “A witness
would see how you stif fen as you look at your real mom and angrily say
that you feel nothing,” I noted. After a long silence I asked again, “So what
happens now?” Maria looked slightly more collapsed and repeated,
“Nothing.” I asked her , “Is there something you want to say to your mom?”
Finally Maria said, “I know you did the best you could,” and then, moments

later: “I wanted you to protect me.” When she began to cry softly , I asked
her , “What is happening inside?” “Holding my chest, my heart feels like it
is pounding really hard,” Maria said. “My sadness goes out to my mom;
how incapable she was of standing up to my father and protecting us. She
just shuts down, pretending everything’ s okay , and in her mind it probably
is, and that makes me mad today . I want to say to her: ‘Mom, when I see
you react to dad when he is being mean . . . when I see your face, you look
disgusted and I don’ t know why you don’ t say , “Fuck of f.” Y ou don’ t know
how to fight—you are such a pushover—there is a part of you that is not
good and not alive. I don’ t even know what I want you to say . I just want
you to be dif ferent—nothing you do is right, like you accept everything
when it is totally not okay .’” I noted, “A witness would see how fierce you
are as you want your mother to stand up to your dad.” Maria then talked
about how she wanted her mother to run of f with the kids and take them
away from her terrifying father .
I then suggested enrolling another group member to represent her ideal
mother . Maria scanned the room again and chose Ellen, a therapist and
martial artist. Maria placed her on a pillow to her right between her real
mother and herself and asked Ellen to put her arm around her . “What do
you want your ideal mother to say to your dad?” I asked. “I want her to say ,
‘If you are going to talk like that, I am going to leave you and take the
kids,’” she answered. “‘W e are not going to sit here and listen to this shit.’”
Ellen repeated Maria’ s words. Then I asked: “What happens now?” Maria
responded: “I like it. I have a little pressure in my head. My breath is free. I
have a subtle ener getic dance in my body now . Sweet.” “A witness can see
how delighted you are when you hear your mother saying that she is not
taking this shit from your dad anymore and that she will take you away
from him,” I told her . Maria began to sob and said, “I would have been able
to be a safe, happy little girl.” Out of the corner of my eye I could see
several group members weeping silently—the possibility of growing up
safe and happy clearly resonated with their own longings.
After a while I suggested that it was time to summon Maria’ s ideal
father . I could clearly see the delight in Maria’ s eyes as she scanned the
group, imagining her ideal father . She finally chose Danny . I gave him his
script, and he gently told her: “I enroll as your ideal father , who would have
loved you and cared for you and who would not have terrified you.” Maria

instructed him to take a seat near her on her left and beamed. “My healthy
mom and dad!” she exclaimed. I responded: “Allow yourself to feel that joy
as you look at an ideal dad who would have cared for you.” Maria cried,
“It’ s beautiful,” and threw her arms around Danny , smiling at him through
her tears. “I am remembering a really tender moment with my dad, and that
is what this feels like. I would love to have my mom next to me too.” Both
ideal parents tenderly responded and cradled her . I left them there for a
while so that they could fully internalize the experience.
W e finished with Danny saying: “If I had been your ideal dad back
then, I would have loved you just like this and not have inflicted my
cruelty ,” while Ellen added, “If I had been your ideal mom, I would have
stood up for you and me and protected you and not let any harm come to
you.” All the characters then made final statements, deenrolling from the
roles they had played, and formally resumed being themselves.
RESCRIPTING YOUR LIFE
Nobody grows up under ideal circumstances—as if we even know what
ideal circumstances are. As my late friend David Servan-Schreiber once
said: every life is dif ficult in its own way . But we do know that, in order to
become self-confident and capable adults, it helps enormously to have
grown up with steady and predictable parents; parents who delighted in
you, in your discoveries and explorations; parents who helped you or ganize
your comings and goings; and who served as role models for self-care and
getting along with other people.
Defects in any of these areas are likely to manifest themselves later in
life. A child who has been ignored or chronically humiliated is likely to
lack self-respect. Children who have not been allowed to assert themselves
will probably have dif ficulty standing up for themselves as adults, and most
grown-ups who were brutalized as children carry a smoldering rage that
will take a great deal of ener gy to contain.
Our relationships will suf fer as well. The more early pain and
deprivation we have experienced, the more likely we are to interpret other
people’ s actions as being directed against us and the less understanding we
will be of their struggles, insecurities, and concerns. If we cannot appreciate

the complexity of their lives, we may see anything they do as a
confirmation that we are going to get hurt and disappointed.
In the chapters on the biology of trauma we saw how trauma and
abandonment disconnect people from their body as a source of pleasure and
comfort, or even as a part of themselves that needs care and nurturance.
When we cannot rely on our body to signal safety or warning and instead
feel chronically overwhelmed by physical stirrings, we lose the capacity to
feel at home in our own skin and, by extension, in the world. As long as
their map of the world is based on trauma, abuse, and neglect, people are
likely to seek shortcuts to oblivion. Anticipating rejection, ridicule, and
deprivation, they are reluctant to try out new options, certain that these will
lead to failure. This lack of experimentation traps people in a matrix of fear ,
isolation, and scarcity where it is impossible to welcome the very
experiences that might change their basic worldview .
This is one reason the highly structured experiences of psychomotor
therapy are so valuable. Participants can safely project their inner reality
into a space filled with real people, where they can explore the cacophony
and confusion of the past. This leads to concrete aha moments: “Y es, that is
what it was like. That is what I had to deal with. And that is what it would
have felt like back then if I had been cherished and cradled.” Acquiring a
sensory experience of feeling treasured and protected as a three-year -old in
the trancelike container of a structure allows people to rescript their inner
experience, as in “I can spontaneously interact with other people without
having to be afraid of being rejected or getting hurt.”
Structures harness the extraordinary power of the imagination to
transform the inner narratives that drive and confine our functioning in the
world. W ith the proper support the secrets that once were too dangerous to
be revealed can be disclosed not just to a therapist, a latter -day father
confessor , but, in our imagination, to the people who actually hurt and
betrayed us.
The three-dimensional nature of the structure transforms the hidden, the
forbidden, and the feared into visible, concrete reality . In this it is somewhat
similar to IFS, which we explored in the previous chapter . IFS calls forth
the split-of f parts that you created in order to survive and enables you to
identify and talk with them, so that your undamaged Self can emer ge. In

contrast, a structure creates a three-dimensional image of whom and what
you had to deal with and gives you a chance to create a dif ferent outcome.
Most people are hesitant to go into past pain and disappointment—it
only promises to bring back the intolerable. But as they are mirrored and
witnessed, a new reality begins to take shape. Accurate mirroring feels
completely dif ferent from being ignored, criticized, and put down. It gives
you permission to feel what you feel and know what you know — one of the
essential foundations of recovery .
T rauma causes people to remain stuck in interpreting the present in
light of an unchanging past. The scene you re-create in a structure may or
may not be precisely what happened, but it represents the structure of your
inner world: your internal map and the hidden rules that you have been
living by .
DARING T O TELL THE TRUTH
I recently led another group structure with a twenty-six-year -old man
named Mark, who at age thirteen had accidentally overheard his father
having phone sex with his aunt, his mother ’ s sister . Mark felt confused,
embarrassed, hurt, betrayed, and paralyzed by this knowledge, but when he
tried to talk with his father about it, he was met with rage and denial: he
was told that he had a filthy imagination and accused of trying to break up
the family . Mark never dared to tell his mom, but henceforth the family
secrets and hypocrisy contaminated every aspect of his home life and gave
him a pervasive sense that nobody could be trusted. After school, he spent
his isolated adolescence hanging around neighborhood basketball courts or
in his room watching TV . When he was twenty-one his mother died—of a
broken heart, Mark says—and his father married the aunt. Mark was not
invited to either the funeral or the wedding.
Secrets like these become inner toxins—realities that you are not
allowed to acknowledge to yourself or to others but that nevertheless
become the template of your life. I knew none of this history when Mark
joined the group, but he stood out by his emotional distance, and during
check-ins he acknowledged that he felt separated from everyone by a dense

fog. I was quite worried about what would be revealed once we started to
look behind his frozen, expressionless exterior .
When I invited Mark to talk about his family , he said a few words and
then seemed to shut down even more. So I encouraged him to ask for a
“contact figure” to support him. He chose a white-haired group member ,
Richard, and placed Richard on a pillow next to him, touching his shoulder .
Then, as he began to tell his story , Mark placed Joe, as his real father , ten
feet in front of him, and directed Carolyn, representing his mother , to
crouch in a corner with her face hidden. Mark next asked Amanda to play
his aunt, telling her to stand defiantly to one side, arms crossed over her
chest—representing all the calculating, ruthless, and devious women who
are after men.
Surveying the tableau he had created, Mark sat up straight, eyes wide
open; clearly the fog had lifted. I said: “A witness can see how startled you
are seeing what you had to deal with.” Mark nodded appreciatively and
remained silent and somber for some time. Then, looking at his “father ,” he
burst out: “Y ou asshole, you hypocrite, you ruined my life.” I invited Mark
to tell his “father” all the things that he had wanted to tell him but never
could. A long list of accusations followed. I directed the “father” to respond
physically as if he had been punched, so that Mark could see that that his
blows had landed. It did not surprise me when Mark spontaneously said that
he’d always worried that his rage would get out of control and that this fear
had kept him from standing up for himself in school, at work, and in other
relationships.
After Mark had confronted his “father ,” I asked if he would like
Richard to assume a new role: that of his ideal father . I instructed Richard to
look Mark directly in the eye and to say: “If I had been your ideal father
back then, I would have listened to you and not accused you of having a
filthy imagination.” When Richard repeated this, Mark started to tremble.
“Oh my God, life would have been so dif ferent if I could have trusted my
father and talked about what was going on. I could have had  a father .” I
then told Richard to say: “If I had been your ideal father back then, I would
have welcomed your anger and you would have had  a father you could have
trusted.” Mark visibly relaxed and said that would have made all the
dif ference in the world.

Then Mark addressed the stand-in for his aunt. The group was visibly
stunned as he unleashed a torrent of abuse on her: “Y ou conniving whore,
you backstabber . Y ou betrayed your sister and ruined her life. Y ou ruined
our family .” After he was done, Mark started to sob. He then said he’d
always been deeply suspicious of any woman who showed an interest in
him. The remainder of the structure took another half hour , in which we
slowly set up conditions for him to create two new women: the ideal aunt,
who did not betray her sister but who helped support their isolated
immigrant family , and the ideal mother , who kept her husband’ s interest and
devotion and so did not die of heartbreak. Mark ended the structure quietly
surveying the scene he had created with a contented smile on his face.
For the remainder of the workshop Mark was an open and valuable
member of the group, and three months later he sent me an e-mail saying
that this experience had changed his life. He had recently moved in with his
first girlfriend, and although they’d had some heated discussions about their
new arrangement, he’d been able to take in her point of view without
clamming up defensively , going back to his fear or rage, or feeling that she
was trying to pull a fast one. He was amazed that he felt okay disagreeing
with her and that he was able to stand up for himself. He then asked for the
name of a therapist in his community to help with the huge changes he was
making in his life, and I fortunately had a colleague I could refer him to.
ANTIDOTES T O P AINFUL MEMORIES
Like the model mugging classes that I discussed in chapter 13, the
structures in psychomotor therapy hold out the possibility of forming virtual
memories that live side by side with the painful realities of the past and
provide sensory experiences of feeling seen, cradled, and supported that can
serve as antidotes to memories of hurt and betrayal. In order to change,
people need to become viscerally familiar with realities that directly
contradict the static feelings of the frozen or panicked self of trauma,
replacing them with sensations rooted in safety , mastery , delight, and
connection. As we saw in the chapter on EMDR, one of the functions of
dreaming is to create associations in which the frustrating events of the day
are interwoven with the rest of one’ s life . Unlike our dreams, psychomotor

structures are still subject to the laws of physics, but they too can reweave
the past.
Of course we can never undo what happened, but we can create new
emotional scenarios intense and real enough to defuse and counter some of
those old ones. The healing tableaus of structures of fer an experience that
many participants have never believed was possible for them: to be
welcomed into a world where people delight in them, protect them, meet
their needs, and make you feel at home.

Is it a fact—or have I dreamt it—that by means of electricity , the

miles in a breathless point of time?

over and over again, is the very root of the judgment, character ,
and will.
—W illiam James
he summer after my first year of medical school, I worked as a part-
time research assistant in Ernest Hartmann’ s sleep laboratory at Boston
State Hospital. My job was to prepare and monitor the study participants
and to analyze their EEG—electroencephalogram, or brain wave—tracings.
Subjects would show up in the evening; I would paste an array of wires
onto their scalps and another set of electrodes around their eyes to register
the rapid eye movements that occur during dreaming. Then I would walk
them to their bedrooms, bid them good night, and start the polygraph, a
bulky machine with thirty-two pens that transmitted their brain activity onto
a continuous spool of paper .

Even though our subjects were fast asleep, the neurons in their brains
kept up their frenzied internal communication, which was transmitted to the
polygraph throughout the night. I’d settle down to pore over the previous
night’ s EEGs, stopping from time to time to pick up baseball scores on my
radio, and use the intercom to wake subjects whenever the polygraph
showed  a REM sleep cycle. I would ask what they had dreamed about and
write down what they reported and then in the morning help them fill out a
questionnaire about sleep quality and send them on their way .
Those quiet nights at Hartmann’ s lab documented a great deal about
REM sleep and contributed to building the basic understanding of sleep
processes, which paved the way for the crucial discoveries that I discussed
in chapter 15. However , until recently , the long-standing hope that the EEG
would help us better understand how electrical brain activity contributes to
psychiatric problems remained lar gely unrealized.
MAPPING THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN
Before the advent of the pharmacological revolution, it was widely
understood that brain activity depends on both chemical and electrical
signals. The subsequent dominance of pharmacology almost obliterated
interest in the electrophysiology of the brain for several decades.
The first recording of the brain’ s electrical activity was made in 1924
by the German psychiatrist Hans Ber ger . This new technology was initially
met with skepticism and ridicule by the medical establishment, but
electroencephalography gradually became an indispensable tool for
diagnosing seizure activity in patients with epilepsy . Ber ger discovered that
dif ferent brain-wave patterns reflected dif ferent mental activities. (For
example, trying to solve a math problem resulted in bursts at a moderately
fast frequency band known as beta.) He hoped that eventually science
would be able to correlate dif ferent psychiatric problems with specific EEG
irregularities. This expectation was fueled by the first reports on EEG
patterns in “behavior problem children” in 1938.1 Most of these hyperactive
and impulsive children had slower -than-normal waves in their frontal lobes.
This finding has been reproduced innumerable times since then, and in
2013 slow-wave prefrontal activity was certified by the Food and Drug

Administration as a biomarker for ADHD. Slow frontal lobe electrical
activity explains why these kids have poor executive functioning: Their
rational brains lack proper control over their emotional brains, which also
occurs when abuse and trauma have made the emotional centers hyperalert
to danger and or ganized for fight or flight.
Early in my career I also hoped that the EEG might help us to make
better diagnoses, and between 1980 and 1990 I sent many of my patients to
get EEGs to determine if their emotional instability was rooted in
neurological abnormalities. The reports usually came back with the phrase:
“nonspecific temporal lobe abnormalities.”2 This told me very little, and
because at that time the only way we could change these ambiguous
patterns was with drugs that had more side ef fects than benefits, I gave up
doing routine EEGs on my patients.
Then, in 2000, a study by my friend Alexander McFarlane and his
associates (researchers in Adelaide, Australia) rekindled my interest, as it
documented clear dif ferences in information processing between
traumatized subjects and a group of “normal” Australians. The researchers
used a standardized test called “the oddball paradigm” in which subjects are
asked to detect the item that doesn’ t fit in a series of otherwise related
images (like a trumpet in a group of tables and chairs). None of the images
was related to trauma.
Normal versus PTSD.  Patterns of attention. Milliseconds after the brain is presented with
input it starts or ganizing the meaning of the incoming information. Normally , all regions of the
brain collaborate in a synchronized pattern (left), while the brainwaves in PTSD are less well
coordinated; the brain has trouble filtering out irrelevant information, and has problems
attending to the stimulus at hand.
In the “normal” group key parts of the brain worked together to
produce a coherent pattern of filtering, focus, and analysis. (See left image

below .) In contrast, the brain waves of traumatized subjects were more
loosely coordinated and failed to come together into a coherent pattern.
Specifically , they did not generate the brain-wave pattern that helps people
pay attention on the task at hand by filtering out irrelevant information (the
upward curve, labeled N200). In addition, the core information-processing
configuration of the brain (the downward peak, P300) was poorly defined;
the depth of the wave determines how well we are able to take in and
analyze new data. This was important new information about how
traumatized people process nontraumatic information that has profound
implications for understanding day-to-day information processing. These
brain-wave patterns could explain why so many traumatized people have
trouble learning from experience and fully engaging in their daily lives.
Their brains are not or ganized to pay careful attention to what is going on in
the present moment.
Sandy McFarlane’ s study reminded me of what Pierre Janet had said
back in 1889: “T raumatic stress is an illness of not being able to be fully
alive in the present.” Y ears later , when I saw the movie The Hurt Locker ,
which dealt with the experiences of soldiers in Iraq, I immediately recalled
Sandy’ s study: As long as they were coping with extreme stress, these men
performed with pinpoint focus; but back in civilian life they were
overwhelmed having to make simple choices in a supermarket. W e are now
seeing alarming statistics about the number of returning combat veterans
who enroll in college on the GI Bill but do not complete their degrees.
(Some estimates are over 80 percent.) Their well-documented problems
with focusing and attention are surely contributing to these poor results.
McFarlane’ s study clarified a possible mechanism for the lack of focus
and attention in PTSD, but it also presented a whole new challenge: W as
there any way to change these dysfunctional brain-wave patterns? It was
seven years before I learned that there might be ways to do that.
In 2007 I met Sebern Fisher at a conference on attachment-disordered
children. Sebern was the former clinical director of a residential treatment
center for severely disturbed adolescents, and she told me that she’d been
using neurofeedback in her private practice for about ten years. She showed
me before-and-after drawings made by a ten-year -old. This boy had had

such severe temper tantrums, learning disabilities, and overall dif ficulties
with self-or ganization that he could not be handled in school.3
His first family portrait (on the left opposite), drawn before treatment
started, was at the developmental level of a three-year -old.  Less than five
weeks later , after twenty sessions of neurofeedback, his tantrums had
decreased and his drawing showed a marked improvement in complexity .
T en weeks and another twenty sessions later , his drawing took another leap
in complexity and his behavior normalized.
I had never come across a treatment that could produce such a dramatic
change in mental functioning in so brief a period of time. So when Sebern
of fered to give me a neurofeedback demonstration, I eagerly accepted.
SEEING THE SYMPHONY OF THE BRAIN
At Sebern’ s of fice in Northampton, Massachusetts, she showed me her
neurofeedback equipment—two desktop computers and a small amplifier—
and some of the data she had collected. She then pasted one electrode on
each side of my skull and another on my right ear . Soon the computer in
front of me was displaying rows of brain waves like the ones I’d seen on the
sleep-lab polygraph three decades earlier . Sebern’ s tiny laptop could detect,
record, and display the electrical symphony of my brain faster and more
precisely than what had probably been a million dollars’ worth of
equipment in Hartmann’ s lab.

Fr om stick figur es to clearly defined human beings.  After four months of neurofeedback, a
ten-year -old boy’ s family drawings show the equivalent of six years of mental development.
As Sebern explained, feedback provides the brain with a mirror of its
own function: the oscillations and rhythms that underpin the currents and
crosscurrents of the mind. Neurofeedback nudges the brain to make more of
some frequencies and less of others, creating new patterns that enhance its
natural complexity and its bias toward self-regulation.4 “In ef fect,” she told
me, “we may be freeing up innate but stuck oscillatory properties in the
brain and allowing new ones to develop.”

Sebern adjusted some settings, “to set the reward and inhibit
frequencies,” as she explained, so that the feedback would reinforce
selected brain-wave patterns while discouraging others. Now I was looking
at something like a video game featuring three spaceships of dif ferent
colors. The computer was emitting irregular tones, and the spaceships were
moving quite randomly . I discovered that when I blinked my eyes they
stopped, and when I calmly stared at the screen they moved in tandem,
accompanied by regular beeps. Sebern then encouraged me to make the
green spaceship move ahead of the others . I leaned forward to concentrate,
but the harder I tried, the more the green spaceship fell behind. She smiled
and told me that I’d do much better if I’d just relax and let my brain take in
the feedback that the computer was generating. So I sat back, and after a
while the tones grew steadier and the green spaceship started pulling ahead
of the others. I felt calm and focused—and my spaceship was winning.
In some ways neurofeedback is similar to watching someone’ s face
during a conversation. If you see smiles or slight nods, you’re rewarded,
and you go on telling your story or making your point. But the moment
your conversation partner looks bored or shifts her gaze, you’ll start to wrap
up or change the topic. In neurofeedback the reward is a tone or movement
on the screen instead of a smile, and the inhibition is far more neutral than a
frown—it’ s simply an undesired pattern.
Next Sebern introduced another feature of neurofeedback: its ability to
track circuitry in specific parts of the brain. She moved the electrodes from
my temples to my left brow , and I started to feel sharp and focused. She told
me she was rewarding beta waves in my frontal cortex, which accounted for
my alertness. When she moved the electrodes to the crown of my head, I
felt more detached from the computer images and more aware of the
sensations in my body . Afterward she showed me a summary graph that
recorded how my brain waves had changed as I experienced subtle shifts in
my mental state and physical sensations.
How could neurofeedback be used to help to treat trauma? As Sebern
explained: “W ith neurofeedback we hope to intervene in the circuitry that
promotes and sustains states of fear and traits of fearfulness, shame, and
rage. It is the repetitive firing of these circuits that defines trauma.” Patients
need help to change the habitual brain patterns created by trauma and its
aftermath. When the fear patterns relax, the brain becomes less susceptible

to automatic stress reactions and better able to focus on ordinary events.
After all, stress is not an inherent property of events themselves—it is a
function of how we label and react to them. Neurofeedback simply
stabilizes the brain and increases resiliency , allowing us to develop more
choices in how to respond.
THE BIR TH OF NEUROFEEDBACK
Neurofeedback was not a new technology in 2007. As early as the late
1950s University of Chicago psychology professor Joe Kamiya, who was
studying the phenomenon of internal perception, had discovered that people
could learn through feedback to tell when they were producing alpha
waves, which are associated with relaxation. (It took some subjects only
four days to reach 100 percent accuracy .) He then demonstrated that they
could also enter voluntarily into an alpha state in response to a simple sound
cue.
In 1968 an article about Kamiya’ s work was published in the popular
magazine Psychology T oday , and the idea that alpha training could relieve
stress and stress-related conditions became widely known.5 The first
scientific work showing that neurofeedback could have an ef fect on
pathological conditions was done by Barry Sterman at UCLA. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration had asked Sterman to study the
toxicity of a rocket fuel, monomethylhydrazine (MMH), which was known
to cause hallucinations, nausea, and seizures. Sterman had previously
trained some cats to produce a specific EEG frequency known as the
sensorimotor rhythm. (In cats this alert, focused state is associated with
waiting to be fed.) He discovered that while his ordinary lab cats developed
seizures after exposure to MMH, the cats that had received neurofeedback
did not. The training had somehow stabilized their brains.
In 1971 Sterman attached his first human subject, twenty-three-year -old
Mary Fairbanks, to a neurofeedback device. She had suf fered from epilepsy
since the age of eight, with grand mal seizures two or more times a month.
She trained for an hour a day twice a week. At the end of three months she
was virtually seizure free. Sterman subsequently received a grant from the

National Institutes of Health to conduct a more systematic study , and the
impressive results were published in the journal Epilepsia  in 1978.6
This period of experimentation and huge optimism about the potential
of the human mind came to an end in the middle 1970s with newly
discovered psychiatric drugs. Psychiatry and brain science adopted a
chemical model of mind and brain, and other treatment approaches were
relegated to the back burner .
Since then the field of neurofeedback has grown by fits and starts, with
much of the scientific groundwork being done in Europe, Russia, and
Australia. Even though there are about ten thousand neurofeedback
practitioners in the United States, the practice has not been able to garner
the research funding necessary to gain widespread acceptance. One reason
may be that there are multiple competing neurofeedback systems; another is
that the commercial potential is limited. Only a few applications are
covered by insurance, which makes neurofeedback expensive for
consumers and prevents practitioners from amassing the resources
necessary to do lar ge-scale studies.
FROM A HOMELESS SHEL TER T O THE NURSING
ST A TION
Sebern had arranged for me to speak with three of her patients. All told
remarkable stories, but as I listened to twenty-seven-year -old Lisa, who was
studying nursing at a nearby college, I felt myself truly awakening to the
stunning potential of this treatment. Lisa possessed the greatest single
resilience factor humans can have: She was an appealing person—
engaging, curious, and obviously intelligent. She made great eye contact,
and she was eager to share what she had learned about herself. Best of all,
like so many survivors I’ve known, she had a wry sense of humor and a
delicious take on human folly .
Based on what I knew about her background, it was a miracle that she
was so calm and self-possessed. She had spent years in group homes and
mental hospitals, and she was a familiar presence in the emer gency rooms
of western Massachusetts—the girl who regularly arrived by ambulance,

half dead from prescription drug overdoses or bloody from self-inflicted
wounds.
Here is how she began her story: “I used to envy the kids who knew
what would happen when their parents got drunk. At least they could
predict the havoc. In my home there was no pattern. Anything could set my
mother of f—eating dinner , watching TV , coming home from school, getting
dressed—and I never knew what she was going to do or how she would
hurt me. It was so random.”
Her father had abandoned the family when Lisa was three years old,
leaving her at the mercy of her psychotic mother . “T orture” is not too strong
a word to describe the abuse she endured. “I lived up in the attic room,” she
told me, “and there was another room up there where I would go and piss
on the carpet because I was too scared to go downstairs to the bathroom. I
would take all the clothes of f my dolls and drive pencils into them and put
them up in my window .”
When she was twelve years old, Lisa ran away from home and was
picked up by the police and returned. After she ran away again, child
protective services stepped in, and she spent the next six years in mental
hospitals, shelters, group homes, foster families, and on the street. No
placement lasted, because Lisa was so dissociated and self-destructive that
she terrified her caretakers. She would attack herself or destroy furniture
and afterward she would not remember what she had done, which earned
her a reputation as a manipulative liar . In retrospect, Lisa told me, she
simply lacked the language to communicate what was going on with her .
When she turned eighteen, she “matured out” of child protective
services and started an independent life, one without family , education,
money , or skills. But shortly after dischar ge she ran into Sebern, who had
just acquired her first neurofeedback equipment and remembered Lisa from
the residential treatment center where she had once worked. She’d always
had a soft spot for this lost girl, and she invited Lisa to try out her new
gizmo.
As Sebern recalled: “When Lisa first came to see me, it was fall. She
walked around with a vacant stare, carrying a pumpkin wherever she went.
There just wasn’ t a there there. I wasn’ t ever sure that I had gotten to any
or ganizing self.” Any form of talk therapy was impossible for Lisa.
Whenever Sebern asked her about anything stressful, she would shut down

or go into a panic. In Lisa’ s words: “Every time we tried to talk about what
had happened to me growing up, I would have a breakdown. I would wake
up with cuts and burns and I wouldn’ t be able to eat. I wouldn’ t be able to
sleep.”
Her sense of terror was omnipresent: “I was afraid all the time. I didn’ t
like to be touched. I was always jumpy and nervous. I couldn’ t close my
eyes if another person was around. There was no convincing me that
someone wasn’ t going to kick me the second I closed my eyes. That makes
you feel crazy . Y ou know you’re in a room with someone you trust, you
know intellectually that nothing’ s going to happen to you, but then there’ s
the rest of your body and you can’ t ever relax. If someone put their arm
around me, I would just check out.” She was stuck in a state of inescapable
shock.
Lisa recalled dissociating when she was a little girl, but things got
worse after puberty: “I started waking up with cuts, and people at school
would know me by dif ferent names. I couldn’ t have a steady boyfriend
because I would date other guys when I was dissociated and then not
remember .  I was blacking out a lot and opening my eyes into some pretty
strange situations.” Like many severely traumatized people, Lisa could not
recognize herself in a mirror .7 I had never heard anyone describe so
articulately what it was like to lack a continuous sense of self.
There was no one to confirm her reality . “When I was seventeen and
living in the group home for severely disturbed adolescents, I cut myself up
really badly with the lid of a tin can. They took me to the emer gency room,
but I couldn’ t tell the doctor what I had done to cut myself—I didn’ t have
any memory of it. The ER doctor was convinced that dissociative identity
disorder didn’ t exist. . . . A lot of people involved in mental health tell you
it doesn’ t exist. Not that you don’ t have it, but that it doesn’ t exist.”
The first thing Lisa did after she aged out of her residential treatment
program was to go of f her medications : “This doesn’ t work for everybody ,”
she acknowledged, “but it turned out to be personally the right choice. I
know people who need meds, but that was not the case for me. After going
of f them and starting neurofeedback, I became much clearer .”
When she invited Lisa to do neurofeedback, Sebern had little idea what
to expect, as Lisa would be the first dissociative patient she tried it on. They

met twice a week and started by rewarding more coherent brain patterns in
the right temporal lobe, the fear center of the brain. After a few weeks Lisa
noticed she was wasn’ t as uptight around people, and she no longer dreaded
the basement laundry room in her building. Then came a bigger
breakthrough: She stopped dissociating. ”I’d always had a constant hum of
low-level conversations in my head,” she recalled. “I was scared I was
schizophrenic. After half a year of neurofeedback I stopped hearing those
noises. I integrated, I guess. Everything just came together .”
As Lisa developed a more continuous sense of self, she became able to
talk about her experiences: “I now can actually talk about things like my
childhood. For the first time I started being able to do  therapy . Up till then I
didn’ t have enough distance and I couldn’ t calm down enough. If you’re
still in it, it’ s hard to talk about it. I wasn’ t able to attach in the way that you
need to attach and open up in the way that you need to open up in order to
have any type of relationship with a therapist.” This was a stunning
revelation: So many patients are in and out of treatment, unable to
meaningfully connect because they are still “in it.”  Of course, when people
don’ t know who they are, they can’ t possibly see the reality of the people
around them.
Lisa went on: “There was so much anxiety around attachment. I would
go into a room and try to memorize every possible way to get out, every
detail about a person. I was trying desperately to keep track of everything
that could hurt me. Now I know people in a dif ferent way . It’ s not based on
memorizing them out of fear . When you’re not afraid of being hurt, you can
know people dif ferently .”
This articulate young woman had emer ged from the depths of despair
and confusion with a degree of clarity and focus I had never seen before. It
was clear that we had to explore the potential of neurofeedback at the
T rauma Center .
GETTING ST AR TED IN NEUROFEEDBACK
First we had to decide which of five dif ferent existing neurofeedback
systems to adopt, and then find a long weekend to learn the principles and
practice on one another .8 Eight staf f members and three trainers volunteered

their time to explore the complexities of EEGs, electrodes, and computer -
generated feedback. On the second morning of the training, when I was
partnered with my colleague Michael, I placed an electrode on the right side
of his head, directly over the sensorimotor strip of his brain, and rewarded
the frequency of eleven to fourteen hertz. Shortly after the session ended,
Michael asked for the attention of the group. He’d just had a remarkable
experience, he told us. He had always felt somewhat on edge and unsafe in
the presence of other people, even colleagues like us. Although nobody
seemed to notice—he was, after all, a well-respected therapist—he lived
with a chronic, gnawing sense of danger . That feeling was now gone, and
he felt safe, relaxed, and open. Over the next three years Michael emer ged
from his habitual low profile to challenge the group with his insights and
opinions, and he became one of the most valuable contributors to our
neurofeedback program.
W ith the help of the ANS Foundation we started our first study with a
group of seventeen patients who had not responded to previous treatments.
W e tar geted the right temporal area of the brain, the location that our early
brain-scan studies (described in chapter 3)9 had shown to be excessively
activated during traumatic stress, and gave them twenty neurofeedback
sessions over ten weeks.
Because most of these patients suf fered from alexithymia, it was not
easy for them to report their response to the treatments. But their actions
spoke for them: They consistently showed up on time for their
appointments, even if they had to drive through snowstorms. None of them
dropped out, and at the end of the full twenty sessions, we could document
significant improvements not only in their PTSD scores,10 but also in their
interpersonal comfort, emotional balance, and self-awareness.1 1 They were
less frantic, they slept better , and they felt calmer and more focused.
In any case, self-reports can be unreliable; objective changes in
behavior are much better indicators of how well treatment works. The first
patient I treated with neurofeedback was a good example. He was a
professional man in his early fifties who defined himself as heterosexual,
but he compulsively sought homosexual contact with strangers whenever he
felt abandoned and misunderstood. His marriage had broken up around this
issue, and he had become HIV positive; he was desperate to gain control

over his behavior . During a previous therapy he had talked extensively
about his sexual abuse by an uncle at around the age of eight. W e assumed
that his compulsion was related to that abuse, but making that connection
had made no dif ference in his behavior . After more than a year of regular
psychotherapy with a competent therapist, nothing had changed.
A week after I started to train his brain to produce slower waves in his
right temporal lobe, he had a distressing ar gument with a new girlfriend,
and instead of going to his habitual cruising spot to find sex he decided to
go fishing. I attributed that response to chance. However , over the next ten
weeks, in the midst of his tumultuous relationship, he continued to find
solace in fishing and began to renovate a lakeside cabin. When we skipped
three weeks of neurofeedback because of our vacations schedules, his
compulsion suddenly returned, suggesting that his brain had not yet
stabilized its new pattern. W e trained for six more months, and now , four
years later , I see him about every six months for a checkup. He has felt no
further impulse to engage in his dangerous sexual activities.
How did his brain come to derive comfort from fishing rather than from
compulsive sexual behavior? At this point  we simply don’ t know .
Neurofeedback changes brain connectivity patterns; the mind follows by
creating new patterns of engagement.
BRAIN-W A VE BASICS FROM SLOW T O F AST
Each line on an EEG charts the activity in a dif ferent part of the brain: a
mixture of dif ferent rhythms, ranged on a scale from slow to fast.12 The
EEG consists of measurements of varying heights (amplitude) and
wavelengths (frequency). Frequency refers to the number of times a
waveform rises and falls in one second, and it is measured in hertz (Hz), or
cycles per second (cps). Every frequency on the EEG is relevant to
understanding and treating trauma, and the basics are relatively easy to
grasp.
Delta waves, the slowest frequencies (2–5 Hz) are seen most often
during sleep. The brain is in an idling state, and the mind is turned inward.
If people have too much slow-wave activity while they’re awake, their
thinking is foggy and they exhibit poor judgment and poor impulse control.

Eighty percent of children with ADHD and many individuals diagnosed
with PTSD have excessive slow waves in their frontal lobes.
The Electr oencephalogram (EEG).  While there is no typical signature for PTSD, many
traumatized people have sharply increased activity in the temporal lobes, as this patient does
(T 3 , T 4 , T 5 ). Neurofeedback can normalize these abnormal brain patterns and thereby increase
emotional stability .
THE RA TE OF BRAINW A VE FIRING IS RELA TED T O
OUR ST A TE OF AROUSAL
Dreaming speeds up brain waves. Theta frequencies (5–8 Hz) predominate
at the edge of sleep, as in the floating “hypnopompic” state I described in

chapter 15 on EMDR; they are also characteristic of hypnotic trance states.
Theta waves create a frame of mind unconstrained by logic or by the
ordinary demands of life and thus open the potential for making novel
connections and associations. One of the most promising EEG
neurofeedback treatments for PTSD, alpha/theta training, makes use of that
quality to loosen frozen associations and facilitate new learning. On the
downside, theta frequencies also occur when we’re “out of it” or depressed.
Alpha waves (8–12 Hz) are accompanied by a sense of peace and
calm.13 They are familiar to anyone who has learned mindfulness
meditation . (A patient once told me that neurofeedback worked for him
“like meditation on steroids.”) I use alpha training most often in my practice
to help people who are either too numb or too agitated to achieve a state of
focused relaxation. W alter Reed National Military Medical Center recently
introduced alpha-training instruments to treat soldiers with PTSD, but at the
time of this writing the results are not yet available.
Beta waves are the fastest frequencies (13–20 Hz). When they
dominate, the brain is oriented to the outside world. Beta enables us to
engage in focused attention while performing a task. However , high beta
(over 20 Hz) is associated with agitation, anxiety , and body tenseness—in
ef fect, we are constantly scanning the environment for danger .
HELPING THE BRAIN T O FOCUS
Neurofeedback training can improve creativity , athletic control, and inner
awareness, even in people who already are highly accomplished.14 When
we started to study neurofeedback, we discovered that sports medicine was
the only department in Boston University that had any familiarity with the
subject. One of my earliest teachers in brain physiology was the sports
psychologist Len Zaichkowsky , who soon left Boston to train the
V ancouver Canucks with neurofeedback.15
Neurofeedback has probably been studied more thoroughly for
performance enhancement than for psychiatric problems. In Italy the trainer
for the soccer club AC Milan used it to help players remain relaxed and
focused as they watched videos of their errors. Their increased mental and
physiological control paid of f when several players joined the Italian team

that won the 2006 W orld Cup—and when AC Milan won the European
championship the following year .16 Neurofeedback was also included in the
science and technology component of Own the Podium, a $1 17 million,
five-year plan engineered to help Canada dominate the 2010 W inter
Olympics in V ancouver . The Canadians won the most gold medals and
came in third overall.
Musical performance has been shown to benefit as well. A panel of
judges from Britain’ s Royal College of Music found that students who were
trained with ten sessions of neurofeedback by John Gruzelier of the
University of London had a 10 percent improvement in the performance of
a piece of music, compared with students who had not received
neurofeedback. This represents a huge dif ference in such a competitive
field.17
Given its enhancement of focus, attention, and concentration, it’ s not
surprising that neurofeedback drew the attention of specialists in attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At least thirty-six studies have
shown that neurofeedback can be an ef fective and time-limited treatment
for ADHD—one that’ s about as ef fective as conventional drugs.18 Once the
brain has been trained to produce dif ferent patterns of electrical
communication, no further treatment is necessary , in contrast to drugs,
which do not change fundamental brain activity and work only as long as
the patient keeps taking them.
WHERE IS THE PROBLEM IN MY BRAIN?
Sophisticated computerized EEG analysis, known as the quantitative EEG
(qEEG), can trace brain-wave activity millisecond by millisecond, and its
software can convert that activity into a color map that shows which
frequencies are highest or lowest in key areas of the brain.19 The qEEG can
also show how well brain regions are communicating or working together .
Several lar ge qEEG databases of both normal and abnormal patterns are
available, which allows us to compare a patient’ s qEEG with those of
thousands of other people with similar issues. Last but not least, in contrast
to fMRIs and related scans, the qEEG is both relatively inexpensive and
portable.

The qEEG provides compelling evidence of the arbitrary boundaries of
current DSM diagnostic categories. DSM labels for mental illness are not
aligned with specific patterns of brain activation. Mental states that are
common to many diagnoses, such as confusion, agitation, or feeling
disembodied, are associated with specific patterns on the qEEG. In general,
the more problems a patient has, the more abnormalities show up in the
qEEG.20
Our patients find it very helpful to be able to see the patterns of
localized electrical activity in their brains. W e can show them the patterns
that seem to be responsible for their dif ficulty focusing or for their lack of
emotional control. They can see why dif ferent brain areas need to be trained
to generate dif ferent frequencies and communication patterns. These
explanations help them shift from self-blaming attempts to control their
behavior to learning to process information dif ferently .
As Ed Hamlin, who trained us in interpreting the qEEG, recently wrote
to me: “Many people respond to the training, but the ones that respond best
and quickest are those that can see how the feedback is related to something
they are doing. For example, if I’m attempting to help someone increase
their ability to be present, we can see how they’re doing with it. Then the
benefit really begins to accumulate. There is something very empowering
about having the experience of changing your brain’ s activity with your
mind.”
HOW DOES TRAUMA CHANGE BRAIN W A VES?
In our neurofeedback lab we see individuals with long histories of traumatic
stress who have only partially responded to existing treatments. Their
qEEGs show a variety of dif ferent patterns. Often there is excessive activity
in the right temporal lobe, the fear center of the brain, combined with too
much frontal slow-wave activity . This means that their hyperaroused
emotional brains dominate their mental life. Our research showed that
calming the fear center decreases trauma-based problems and improves
executive functioning. This is reflected not only in a significant decrease in
patients’ PTSD scores but also in improved mental clarity and an increased

ability to regulate how upset they become in response to relatively minor
provocations.21
Other traumatized patients show patterns of hyperactivity the moment
they close their eyes: Not seeing what is going on around them makes them
panic and their brain waves go wild. W e train them to produce more relaxed
brain patterns. Y et another group overreacts to sounds and light, a sign that
the thalamus has dif ficulty filtering out irrelevant information. In those
patients we focus on changing communication patterns at the back of the
brain.
While our center is focused on finding optimal treatments for long-
standing traumatic stress, Alexander McFarlane is studying how exposure
to combat changes previously normal brains. The Australian Department of
Defence asked his research group to measure the ef fects of deployment to
combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan on mental and biological functioning,
including brain-wave patterns. In the initial phase McFarlane and his
colleagues measured the qEEG in 179 combat troops four months prior to
and four months after each successive deployment to the Middle East.
They found that the total number of months in combat over a three-year
period was associated with progressive decreases in alpha power at the back
of the brain. This area ,  which monitors the state of the body and regulates
such elementary processes as sleep and hunger , ordinarily has the highest
level of alpha waves of any region in the brain, particularly when people
close their eyes. As we have seen, alpha is associated with relaxation. The
decrease in alpha power in these soldiers reflects a state of persistent
agitation. At the same time the brain waves at the front of the brain, which
normally have high levels of beta, show a progressive slowing with each
deployment. The soldiers gradually develop frontal-lobe activity that
resembles that of children with ADHD, which interferes with their
executive functioning and capacity for focused attention.
The net ef fect is that arousal, which is supposed to provide us with the
ener gy needed to engage in day-to-day tasks, no longer helps these soldiers
to focus on ordinary tasks. It simply makes them agitated and restless. At
this stage of McFarlane’ s study , it  is too early to know  if any of these
soldiers will develop PTSD, and only time will tell to what degree these
brains will readjust to the pace of civilian life.

NEUROFEEDBACK AND LEARNING DISABILITIES
Chronic abuse and neglect in childhood interfere with the proper wiring of
sensory-integration systems. In some cases this results in learning
disabilities, which include faulty connections between the auditory and
word-processing systems, and poor hand-eye coordination. As long as they
are frozen or explosive, it is dif ficult to see how much trouble the
adolescents in our residential treatment programs have processing day-to-
day information, but once their behavioral problems have been successfully
treated, their learning disabilities often become manifest. Even if these
traumatized kids could sit still and pay attention, many of them would still
be handicapped by their poor learning skills.22
Lisa described how trauma had interfered with the proper wiring of
basic processing functions. She told me she “always got lost” going places,
and she recalled having a marked auditory delay that kept her from being
able to follow the instructions from her teachers. “Imagine being in a
classroom,” she said, “and the teacher comes in and says, ‘Good morning.
T urn to page two-seventy-two. Do problems one to five.’ If you’re even a
fraction of a second of f, it’ s just a jumble. It was impossible to concentrate.”
Neurofeedback helped her to reverse these learning disabilities. “I
learned to keep track of things; for example, to read maps. Right after we
started therapy , there was this memorable time when I was going from
Amherst to Northampton [less than ten miles] to meet Sebern. I was
supposed to take a couple of buses, but I ended up walking along the
highway for a couple miles. I was that disor ganized—I couldn’ t read the
schedule; I couldn’ t keep track of the time. I was too jacked up and nervous,
which made me tired all the time. I couldn’ t pay attention and keep it
together . I just couldn’ t or ganize my brain around it.”
That statement defines the challenge for brain and mind science: How
can we help people learn to or ganize time and space, distance and
relationships, capacities that are laid down in the brain during the first few
years of life, if early trauma has interfered with their development? Neither
drugs nor conventional therapy have been shown to activate the
neuroplasticity necessary to bring those capacities online after the critical
periods have passed. Now is the time to study whether neurofeedback can
succeed where other interventions have failed.

ALPHA-THET A TRAINING
Alpha-theta training is a particularly fascinating neurofeedback procedure,
because it can induce the sorts of hypnagogic states—the essence of
hypnotic trance—that are discussed in chapter 15.23 When theta waves
predominate in the brain, the mind’ s focus is on the internal world, a world
of free-floating imagery . Alpha brain waves may act as a bridge from the
external world to the internal, and vice versa. In alpha-theta training these
frequencies are alternately rewarded.
The challenge in PTSD is to open the mind to new possibilities, so that
the present is no longer interpreted as a continuous reliving of the past.
T rance states, during which theta activity dominates, can help to loosen the
conditioned connections between particular stimuli and responses, such as
loud cracks signaling gunfire, a harbinger of death. A new association can
be created in which that same crack can come to be linked to Fourth of July
fireworks at the end of a day at the beach with loved ones.
In the twilight states fostered by alpha/theta training, traumatic events
may be safely reexperienced and new associations fostered. Some patients
report unusual imagery and/or deep insights about their life; others simply
become more relaxed and less rigid. Any state in which people can safely
experience images, feelings, and emotions that are associated with dread
and helplessness is likely to create fresh potential and a wider perspective.
Can alpha-theta reverse hyperarousal patterns? The accumulated
evidence is promising. Eugene Peniston and Paul Kulkosky , researchers at
the V A Medical Center in Fort L yon, Colorado, used neurofeedback to treat
twenty-nine V ietnam veterans with a twelve- to- fifteen-year history of
chronic combat-related PTSD. Fifteen of the men were randomly assigned
to the EEG alpha-theta training and fourteen to a control  group that
received standard medical care, including psychotropic drugs and individual
and group therapy . On average, participants in both groups had been
hospitalized more than five times for their PTSD. The neurofeedback
facilitated twilight states of learning by rewarding both alpha and theta
waves. As the men lay back in a recliner with their eyes closed, they were
coached to allow the neurofeedback sounds to guide them into deep
relaxation. They were also asked to use positive mental imagery (for

example, being sober , living confidently and happily) as they moved toward
the trancelike alpha-theta state.
This study , published in 1991, had one of the best outcomes ever
recorded for PTSD. The neurofeedback group had a significant decrease in
their PTSD symptoms, as well as in physical complaints, depression,
anxiety , and paranoia. After the treatment phase the veterans and their
family members were contacted monthly for a period of thirty months. Only
three of the fifteen neurofeedback-treated veterans reported disturbing
flashbacks and nightmares. All three chose to under go ten booster sessions;
only one needed to return to the hospital for further treatment. Fourteen out
of fifteen were using significantly less medication.
In contrast, every vet in the comparison group experienced an increase
in PTSD symptoms during the follow-up period, and all of them required at
least two further hospitalizations. T en of the comparison group also
increased their medication use.24 This study has been replicated by other
researchers, but it has received surprisingly little attention outside the
neurofeedback community .25
NEUROFEEDBACK, PTSD, AND ADDICTION
Approximately one-third to one-half of severely traumatized people
develop substance abuse problems.26 Since the time of Homer , soldiers
have used alcohol to numb their pain, irritability , and depression. In one
recent study half of motor vehicle accident victims developed problems
with drugs or alcohol. Alcohol abuse makes people careless and thus
increases their chances of being traumatized again (although being drunk
during an assault actually decreases the likelihood of developing PTSD).
There is a circular relationship between PTSD and substance abuse:
While drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from trauma
symptoms, withdrawing from them increases hyperarousal, thereby
intensifying nightmares, flashbacks, and irritability . There are only two
ways to end this vicious cycle: by resolving the symptoms of PTSD with
methods such as EMDR or by treating the hyperarousal that is part of both
PTSD and withdrawal from drugs or alcohol. Drugs such as naltrexone are

sometimes prescribed to reduce hyperarousal, but this treatment helps in
only some cases.
One of the first women I trained with neurofeedback had a long-
standing cocaine addiction, in addition to a horrendous childhood history of
sexual abuse and abandonment. Much to my surprise, her cocaine habit
cleared after the first two sessions and on follow-up five years later had not
returned. I had never seen anyone recover this quickly from severe drug
abuse, so I turned to the existing scientific literature for guidance.27 Most of
the studies on this subject were done more than two decades ago; in recent
years, very few neurofeedback studies for the treatment of addiction have
been published, at least in the United States.
Between 75 percent and 80 percent of patients who are admitted for
detox and alcohol and drug abuse treatment will relapse. Another study by
Peniston and Kulkosky—on the ef fects of neurofeedback training with
veterans who had dual diagnoses of alcoholism and PTSD28—focused on
this problem . Fifteen veterans received alpha-theta training, while the
control group received standard treatment without neurofeedback. The
subjects were followed up regularly for three years, during which eight
members of neurofeedback group stopped drinking completely and one got
drunk once but became sick and didn’ t drink again. Most of them were
markedly less depressed. As Peniston put it, the changes reported
corresponded to being “more warmhearted, more intelligent, more
emotionally stable, more socially bold, more relaxed and more satisfied.”29
In contrast, all of those given standard treatment were readmitted to the
hospital within eighteen months.30 Since that time a number of studies on
neurofeedback for addictions have been published,31 but this important
application needs much more research to establish its potential and
limitations.
THE FUTURE OF NEUROFEEDBACK
In my practice I use neurofeedback primarily to help with the hyperarousal,
confusion, and concentration problems of people who suf fer from
developmental trauma. However , it has also shown good results for
numerous issues and conditions that go beyond the scope of this book,

including relieving tension headaches, improving cognitive functioning
following a traumatic brain injury , reducing anxiety and panic attacks,
learning to deepen meditation states, treating autism, improving seizure
control, self-regulation in mood disorders, and more. As of 2013
neurofeedback is being used in seventeen military and V A facilities to treat
PTSD,32 and scientific documentation of its ef ficacy in recent combat vets
is just beginning to be assessed. Frank Duf fy , the director of the clinical
neurophysiology and developmental neurophysiology laboratories of
Boston Children’ s Hospital, has commented: “The literature, which lacks
any negative study , suggests that neurofeedback plays a major therapeutic
role in many dif ferent areas. In my opinion, if any medication had
demonstrated such a wide spectrum of ef ficacy it would be universally
accepted and widely used.”33
Many questions remain to be answered about treatment protocols for
neurofeedback, but the scientific paradigm is gradually shifting in a
direction that invites a deeper exploration of these questions. In 2010
Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, published
an article in Scientific American entitled “Faulty Circuits,” in which he
called for a return to understanding mind and brain in terms of the rhythms
and patterns of electrical communication: “Brain regions that function
together to carry out normal (and abnormal) mental operations can be
thought of as analogous to electrical circuits—the latest research shows that
the malfunctioning of entire circuits may underlie many mental
disorders.”34 Three years later Insel announced that NIMH was “re-
orienting its research away from DSM categories”35 and focusing instead
on “disorders of the human connectome.”36
As explained by Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of
Health (of which NIMH is a part), “The connectome refers to the
exquisitely interconnected network of neurons (nerve cells) in your brain.
Like the genome, the microbiome, and other exciting ‘ome’ fields, the ef fort
to map the connectome and decipher the electrical signals that zap through
it to generate your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors has become possible
through development of powerful new tools and technologies.”37 The
connectome is now being mapped in detail under the auspices of NIMH.

As we await the results of this research, I’d like to give the last word to
Lisa, the survivor who introduced me to the enormous potential of
neurofeedback. When I asked her to summarize what the treatment had
done for her , she said: “It calmed me down. It stopped the dissociation. I
can use my feelings; I’m not running away from them. I’m not held hostage
by them. I can’ t turn them of f and on, but I can put them away . I may be sad
about the abuse I went through, but I can put it away . I can call a friend and
not talk about it if I don’ t want to talk about it ,  or I can do homework or
clean my apartment. Emotions mean something now . I’m not anxious all the
time, and when I am anxious, I can reflect on it. If the anxiety’ s coming
from the past, I can find it there, or I can look at how it relates to my life
now . And it’ s not just negative emotions, like anger and anxiety—I can
reflect on love and intimacy or sexual attraction. I’m not in fight-or -flight
all the time. My blood pressure is down. I’m not physically prepared to take
of f at any moment or defend myself against an attack. Neurofeedback made
it possible for me to have a relationship. Neurofeedback freed me up to live
my life the way I want to, because I’m not always in the thrall of how I was
hurt and what it did to me.”
Four years after I met her and recorded our conversations, Lisa
graduated near the top of her nursing school class, and she now works full
time as a nurse at a local hospital.

Acting is not about putting on a character but discovering the
character within you: you are the character , you just have to find it
within yourself—albeit a very expanded version of yourself.
—T ina Packer
any scientists I know were inspired by their children’ s health
problems to find new ways of understanding mind, brain, and
therapy . My own son’ s recovery from a mysterious illness that, for lack of a
better name, we call chronic fatigue syndrome, convinced me of the
therapeutic possibilities of theater .
Nick spent most of seventh and eighth grade in bed, bloated by
aller gies and medications that left him too exhausted to go to school. His
mother and I saw him becoming entrenched in his identity as a self-hating
and isolated kid, and we were desperate to help him. When his mother
realized that he picked up a little ener gy round 5:00 p.m., we signed him up
for an evening class in improvisational theater where he would at least have
a chance to interact with other boys and girls his age. He took to the group
and to the acting exercises and soon landed his first role, as Action in W est
Side Story , a tough kid who’ s always ready to fight and has the lead in
singing “Gee, Of ficer Krupke.” One day at home I caught him walking with
a swagger , practicing what it was like to be somebody with clout. W as he

developing a physical sense of pleasure, imagining himself as a strong guy
who commands respect?
Then he was cast as the Fonz in Happy Days.  Being adored by girls and
keeping an audience spellbound became the real tipping point in his
recovery . Unlike his experience with the numerous therapists who had
talked with him about how bad he felt, theater gave him a chance to deeply
and physically experience what it was like to be someone other than the
learning-disabled, oversensitive boy that he had gradually become. Being a
valued contributor to a group gave him a visceral experience of power and
competence. I believe that this new embodied version of himself set him on
the road to becoming the creative, loving adult he is today .
Our sense of agency , how much we feel in control, is defined by our
relationship with our bodies and its rhythms: Our waking and sleeping and
how we eat, sit, and walk define the contours of our days. In order to find
our voice, we have to be in  our bodies—able to breathe fully and able to
access our inner sensations. This is the opposite of dissociation, of being
“out of body” and making yourself disappear . It’ s also the opposite of
depression, lying slumped in front of a screen that provides passive
entertainment. Acting is an experience of using your body to take your
place in life.
THE THEA TER OF W AR
Nick’ s transformation was not the first time I’d witnessed the benefits of
theater . In 1988 I was still treating three veterans with PTSD whom I’d met
at the V A, and when they showed a sudden improvement in their vitality ,
optimism, and family relationships, I attributed it to my growing therapeutic
skills. Then I discovered that all three were involved in a theatrical
production.
W anting to dramatize the plight of homeless veterans, they had
persuaded playwright David Mamet, who was living nearby , to meet
weekly with their group to develop a script around their experiences.
Mamet then recruited Al Pacino, Donald Sutherland, and Michael J. Fox to
come to Boston for an evening called Sketches of W ar , which raised money
to convert the V A clinic where I’d met my patients into a shelter for

homeless veterans.1 Standing on a stage with professional actors, speaking
about  their memories of the war ,  and reading their poetry was clearly a
more transformative experience than any therapy could have of fered them.
Since time immemorial human beings have used communal rituals to
cope with their most powerful and terrifying feelings. Ancient Greek
theater , the oldest of which we have written records, seems to have grown
out of religious rites that involved dancing, singing, and reenacting
mythical stories. By the fifth century BCE, theater played a central role in
civic life, with the audience seated in a horseshoe around the stage, which
enabled them to see one another ’ s emotions and reactions.
Greek drama may have served as a ritual reintegration for combat
veterans. At the time Aeschylus wrote the Or esteia trilogy , Athens was at
war on six fronts; the cycle of tragedy is set in motion when the returning
warrior king Agamemnon is murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, for
having sacrificed their daughter before sailing to the T rojan W ar . Military
service was required of every adult citizen of Athens, so audiences were
undoubtedly composed of combat veterans and active-duty soldiers on
leave. The performers themselves must have been citizen-soldiers.
Sophocles was a general of ficer in Athens’ s wars against the Persians,
and his play Ajax , which ends with the suicide of one of the T rojan W ar ’ s
greatest heroes, reads like a textbook description of traumatic stress. In
2008 writer and director Bryan Doerries arranged a reading of Ajax  for five
hundred marines  in San Diego and was stunned by the reception it received.
(Like many of us who work with trauma, Doerries’ s inspiration was
personal; he had studied classics in college and turned to the Greek texts for
comfort when he lost a girlfriend to cystic fibrosis.) His project “The
Theater of W ar” evolved from that first event, and with funding from the
U.S. Department of Defense, this 2,500-year -old play has since been
performed more than two hundred times here and abroad to give voice to
the plight of combat veterans and foster dialogue and understanding in their
families and friends.2
Theater of W ar performances are followed by a town hall–style
discussion. I attended a reading of Ajax  in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
shortly after the news media had publicized a 27 percent increase in
suicides among combat veterans over the previous three years. Some forty

people—V ietnam veterans, military wives, recently dischar ged men and
women who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan—lined up behind the
microphone. Many of them quoted lines from the play as they spoke about
their sleepless nights, drug addiction, and alienation from their families.
The atmosphere was electric, and afterward the audience huddled in the
foyer , some holding each other and crying, others in deep conversation.
As Doerries later said: “Anyone who has come into contact with
extreme pain, suf fering or death has no trouble understanding Greek drama.
It’ s all about bearing witness to the stories of veterans.”3
KEEPING T OGETHER IN TIME
Collective movement and music create a lar ger context for our lives, a
meaning beyond our individual fate. Religious rituals universally involve
rhythmic movements, from davening at the W ailing W all in Jerusalem to
the sung litur gy and gestures of the Catholic Mass to moving meditation in
Buddhist ceremonies and the rhythmic prayer rituals performed five times a
day by devout Muslims.
Music was a backbone of the civil rights movement in the United
States. Anyone alive at that time will not for get the lines of marchers, arms
linked, singing “W e Shall Overcome” as they walked steadily toward the
police who were massed to stop them. Music binds together people who
might individually be terrified but who collectively become powerful
advocates for themselves and others. Along with language, dancing,
marching, and singing are uniquely human ways to install a sense of hope
and courage.
I observed the force of communal rhythms in action when I watched
Archbishop Desmond T utu conduct public hearings for the T ruth and
Reconciliation Commission in South Africa in 1996. These events were
framed by collective singing and dancing. W itnesses recounted the
unspeakable atrocities that had been inflicted on them and their families.
When they became overwhelmed, T utu would interrupt their testimony and
lead the entire audience in prayer , song, and dance until the witnesses could
contain their sobbing and halt their physical collapse. This enabled
participants to pendulate in and out of reliving their horror and eventually to

find words to describe what had happened to them. I fully credit T utu and
the other member of the commission with averting what might have been an
or gy of revenge, as is so common when victims are finally set free.
A few years ago I discovered Keeping T ogether in T ime ,4 written by the
great historian W illiam H. McNeill near the end of his career . This short
book examines the historical role of dance and military drill in creating
what McNeill calls “muscular bonding” and sheds a new light on the
importance of theater , communal dance, and movement. It also solved a
long-standing puzzle in my own mind. Having been raised in the
Netherlands, I had always wondered how a group of simple Dutch peasants
and fishermen had won their liberation from the mighty Spanish empire.
The Eighty Y ears’ W ar , which lasted from the late sixteenth to the
midseventeenth century , began as a series of guerrilla actions, and it seemed
destined to remain that way , since the ill-disciplined, ill-paid soldiers
regularly fled under volleys of musket fire.
This changed when Prince Maurice of Orange became the leader of the
Dutch rebels. Still in his early twenties, he had recently completed his
schooling in Latin, which enabled him to read 1,500-year -old Roman
manuals on military tactics. He learned that the Roman general L ycur gus
had introduced marching in step to the Roman legions and that the historian
Plutarch had attributed their invincibility to this practice: “It was at once a
magnificent and terrible sight, to see them march on to the tune of their
flutes, without any disorder in their ranks, any discomposure in their minds
or change in their countenances, calmly and cheerfully moving with music
to the deadly fight.”5
Prince Maurice instituted close-order drill, accompanied by drums,
flutes, and trumpets, in his ragtag army . This collective ritual not only
provided his men with a sense of purpose and solidarity , but also made it
possible for them to execute complicated maneuvers. Close-order drill
subsequently spread across Europe, and to this day the major services of the
U.S. military spend liberally on their marching bands, even though fifes and
drums no longer accompany troops into battle.
Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, who was born in the tiny Baltic country
of Estonia, told me the remarkable story of Estonia’ s “Singing Revolution.”
In June 1987, on one of those endless sub-Arctic summer evenings, more

than ten thousand concertgoers at the T allinn Song Festival Grounds linked
hands and began to sing patriotic songs that had been forbidden during half
a century of Soviet occupation. These songfests and protests continued, and
on September 1 1, 1988, three hundred thousand people, about a quarter of
the population of Estonia, gathered to sing and make a public demand for
independence. By August 1991 the Congress of Estonia had proclaimed the
restoration of the Estonian state, and when Soviet tanks attempted to
intervene, people acted as human shields to protect T allinn’ s radio and TV
stations. As a columnist noted in the New Y ork T imes : “Imagine the scene in
Casablanca  in which the French patrons sing “La Marseillaise” in defiance
of the Germans, then multiply its power by a factor of thousands, and
you’ve only begun to imagine the force of the Singing Revolution.”6
TREA TING TRAUMA THROUGH THEA TER
It is surprising how little research exists on how collective ceremonies
af fect the mind and brain and how they might prevent or alleviate trauma.
Over the past decade, however , I have had a chance to observe and study
three dif ferent programs for treating trauma through theater: Urban Improv
in Boston7 and the T rauma Drama program it inspired in the Boston public
schools and in our residential centers;8 the Possibility Project, directed by
Paul Grif fin in New Y ork City;9 and Shakespeare & Company , in Lenox,
Massachusetts, which runs a program for juvenile of fenders called
Shakespeare in the Courts.10 In this chapter , I’ll focus on these three groups,
but there are many excellent therapeutic drama programs in the United
States and abroad, making theater a widely available resource for recovery .
Despite their dif ferences, all of these programs share a common
foundation: confrontation of the painful realities of life and symbolic
transformation through communal action. Love and hate, aggression and
surrender , loyalty and betrayal are the stuf f of theater and the stuf f of
trauma. As a culture we are trained to cut ourselves of f from the truth of
what we’re feeling. In the words of T ina Packer , the charismatic founder of
Shakespeare & Company: “T raining actors involves training people to go
against that tendency—not only to feel deeply , but to convey that feeling at

every moment to the audience, so the audience will get it—and not close of f
against it.”
T raumatized people are terrified to feel deeply . They are afraid to
experience their emotions, because emotions lead to loss of control. In
contrast, theater is about embodying emotions, giving voice to them,
becoming rhythmically engaged, taking on and embodying dif ferent roles.
As we’ve seen, the essence of trauma is feeling godforsaken, cut of f
from the human race. Theater involves a collective confrontation with the
realities of the human condition. As Paul Grif fin, discussing his theater
program for foster -care children, told me: “The stuf f of tragedy in theater
revolves around coping with betrayal, assault, and destruction. These kids
have no trouble understanding what Lear , Othello, Macbeth, or Hamlet are
all about.” In T ina Packer ’ s words: “Everything is about using the whole
body and having other bodies resonate with your feelings, emotions and
thoughts.” Theater gives trauma survivors a chance to connect with one
another by deeply experiencing their common humanity .
T raumatized people are afraid of conflict. They fear losing control and
ending up on the losing side once again. Conflict is central to theater—inner
conflicts, interpersonal conflicts, family conflicts, social conflicts, and their
consequences. T rauma is about trying to for get, hiding how scared, enraged,
or helpless you are. Theater is about finding ways of telling the truth and
conveying deep truths to your audience. This requires pushing through
blockages to discover your own truth, exploring and examining your own
internal experience so that it can emer ge in your voice and body on stage.
MAKING IT SAFE T O ENGAGE
These theater programs are not for aspiring actors but for angry , frightened,
and obstreperous teenagers or withdrawn, alcoholic, burned-out veterans.
When they come to rehearsal, they slump into their chairs, fearful that
others will immediately see what failures they are. T raumatized adolescents
are a jumble: inhibited, out of tune, inarticulate, uncoordinated, and
purposeless. They are too hyperaroused to notice what is going on around
them. They are easily triggered and rely on action rather than words to
dischar ge their feelings.

All the directors I’ve worked with agree that the secret is to go slow
and engage them bit by bit. The initial challenge is simply to get
participants to be more present in the room. Here’ s Kevin Coleman, director
of Shakespeare in the Courts, describing his work with teens when I
interviewed him: “First we get them up and walking around the room. Then
we start to create a balance in the space, so they’re not walking aimlessly ,
but become aware of other people. Gradually , with little prompts, it
becomes more complex: Just walk on your toes, or on your heels, or walk
backwards. Then, when you bump into someone, scream and fall down.
After maybe thirty prompts, they’re out there waving their arms in the air ,
and we get to a full-body warm up, but it’ s incremental. If you take too big
a jump, you’ll see them hit the wall.
“Y ou have to make it safe for them to notice each other . Once their
bodies are a little more free, I might use the prompt: ‘Don’ t make eye
contact with anyone—just look at the floor .’ Most of them are thinking:
‘Great, I’m doing that already ,’ but then I say ‘Now begin to notice people
as you go by , but don’ t let them see you looking.’ And next: ‘Just make eye
contact for a second.’ Then: ‘Now , no eye contact . . . now , contact . . . now ,
no contact. Now , make eye contact and hold  it . . . too long. Y ou’ll know
when it’ s too long because you’ll either want to start dating that person or to
have a fight with them. That’ s when it’ s too long.’
“They don’ t make that kind of extended eye contact in their normal
lives, not even with a person they’re talking to. They don’ t know if that
person is safe or not. So what you’re doing is making it safe for them not to
disappear when they make eye contact, or when someone looks at them. Bit
by bit, by bit, by bit . . .”
T raumatized adolescents are noticeably out of sync. In the T rauma
Center ’ s T rauma Drama program, we use mirroring exercises to help them
to get in tune with one another . They move their right arm up, and their
partner mirrors it; they twirl, and their partner twirls in response. They
begin to observe how body movements and facial expressions change, how
their own natural movements dif fer from those of others, and how
unaccustomed movements and expressions make them feel. Mirroring
loosens their preoccupation with what other people think of them and helps
them attune viscerally , not cognitively , to someone else’ s experience. When

mirroring ends in giggles, it’ s a sure indication that our participants feel
safe.
In order to become real partners, they also need to learn to trust one
another . An exercise in which one person is blindfolded while his partner
leads him by the hand is especially tough for our kids. It’ s often as
terrifying for them to be the leader , to be trusted by someone vulnerable, as
it is to be blindfolded and led. At first they may last for only ten or twenty
seconds, but we gradually work them up to five minutes. Afterward some of
them have to go of f by themselves for a while, because it is so emotionally
overwhelming to feel these connections.
The traumatized kids and veterans we work with are embarrassed to be
seen, afraid to be in touch with what they are feeling, and they keep one
another at arm’ s length. The job of any director , like that of any therapist, is
to slow things down so the actors can establish a relationship with
themselves, with their bodies. Theater of fers a unique way to access a full
range of emotions and physical sensations that not only put them in touch
with the habitual “set” of their bodies, but also let them explore alternative
ways of engaging with life.
URBAN IMPROV
My son loved his theater group, which was run by Urban Improv (UI), a
long-standing Boston arts institution. He stayed with them through high
school and then volunteered to work with them the summer after his
freshman year in college. It was then that he learned that UI’ s violence
prevention program, which has run hundreds of workshops in local schools
since 1992, had received a research grant to assess its ef ficacy—and that
they were looking for someone to head the study . Nick suggested to the
directors, Kippy Dewey and Cissa Campion, that his dad would be the ideal
person for the job. Luckily for me, they agreed.
I began to visit schools with UI’ s multicultural ensemble, which
included a director , four professional actor -educators, and a musician.
Urban Improv creates scripted skits depicting the kinds of problems that
students face every day: exclusion from peer groups, jealousy , rivalry and
anger , and family strife. Skits for older students also address issues like

dating, STDs, homophobia, and peer violence. In a typical presentation the
professional actors might portray a group of kids excluding a newcomer
from a lunch table in the cafeteria. As the scene approaches a choice point
—for example, the new student responds to their put-downs—the director
freezes the action. A member of the class is then invited to replace one of
the actors and show how he or she would feel and behave in this situation.
These scenarios enable the students to observe day-to-day problems with
some emotional distance while experimenting with various solutions: W ill
they confront the tormenters, talk to a friend, call the homeroom teacher ,
tell their parents what happened?
Another volunteer is then asked to try a dif ferent approach, so that
students can see how other choices might play out. Props and costumes help
the participants take risks in new roles, as do the playful atmosphere and the
support from the actors. In the discussion groups afterward students respond
to questions like “How was this scene similar or dif ferent from what
happens in your school?” “How do you get the respect that you need?” and
“How do you settle your dif ferences?” These discussions become lively
exchanges as many students volunteer their thoughts and ideas.
Our T rauma Center team evaluated this program at two grade levels in
seventeen participating schools. Classrooms that participated in the UI
program were compared with similar nonparticipating classrooms. At the
fourth-grade level, we found a significant positive response. On
standardized rating scales for aggression, cooperation, and self-control,
students in the UI group showed substantially fewer fights and angry
outbursts, more cooperation and self-assertion with peers, and more
attentiveness and engagement in the classroom.1 1
Much to our surprise, these results were not matched by the eighth
graders. What had happened in the interim that af fected their responses? At
first we had only our personal impressions to go on. When I’d visited the
fourth-grade classes, I’d been struck by their wide-eyed innocence and their
eagerness to participate. The eighth graders, in contrast, were often sullen
and defensive and as a group seemed to have lost their spontaneity and
enthusiasm. Onset of puberty was one obvious factor for the change, but
might there be others?

When we delved further , we found that the older children had
experienced more than twice as much trauma as the younger ones: Every
single eighth grader in these typical American inner -city schools had
witnessed serious violence. T wo-thirds had observed five or more incidents,
including stabbings, gunfights, killings, and domestic assaults. Our data
showed that eighth graders with such high levels of exposure to violence
were significantly more aggressive than students without these histories and
that the program made no significant dif ference in their behavior .
The T rauma Center team decided to see if we could turn this situation
around with a longer and more intensive program that focused on team
building and emotion-regulation exercises, using scripts that dealt directly
with the kinds of violence these kids experienced. For several months
members of our staf f, led by Joseph Spinazzola, met weekly with the UI
actors to work on script development. The actors taught our psychologists
improvisation, mirroring, and precise physical attunement so they could
credibly portray melting down, confronting, cowering, or collapsing. W e
taught the actors about trauma triggers and how to recognize and deal with
trauma reenactments.12
During the winter and spring of 2005, we tested the resulting program
at a specialized day school run jointly by the Boston Public Schools and the
Massachusetts Department of Correction.  This was a chaotic environment
in which students often shuttled back and forth between school and jail. All
of them came from high-crime neighborhoods and had been exposed to
horrendous violence; I had never seen such an aggressive and sullen group
of kids. W e got a glimpse into the lives of the innumerable middle school
and high school teachers who deal daily with students whose first response
to new challenges is to lash out or go into defiant withdrawal.
W e were shocked to discover that, in scenes where someone was in
physical danger , the students always sided with the aggressors. Because
they could not tolerate any sign of weakness in themselves, they could not
accept it in others. They showed nothing but contempt for potential victims,
yelling things like, “Kill the bitch, she deserves it,” during a skit about
dating violence.
At first some of the professional actors wanted to give up—it was
simply too painful to see how mean these kids were—but they stuck it out,

and I was amazed to see how they gradually got the students to experiment,
however reluctantly , with new roles. T oward the end of the program, a few
students were even volunteering for parts that involved showing
vulnerability or fear . When they received  their certificate of completion,
several shyly gave the actors drawings to express their appreciation. I
detected a few tears, possibly even in myself.
Our attempt to make T rauma Drama a regular part of the eighth-grade
curriculum in the Boston public schools unfortunately ran into a wall of
bureaucratic resistance. Nonetheless, it lives on as an integral part of the
residential treatment programs at the Justice Resource Institute, while
music, theater , art, and sports—timeless ways of fostering competence and
collective bonding—continue to disappear from our schools.
THE POSSIBILITY PROJECT
In Paul Grif fin’ s New Y ork City Possibility Project the actors are not
presented with prepared scripts. Instead, over a nine-month period they
meet for three hours a week, write their own full-length musical, and
perform it for several hundred people. During its twenty-year history the
Possibility Project has accrued a stable staf f and strong traditions. Each
production team is made up of recent graduates who, with the help of
professional actors, dancers, and musicians, or ganize scriptwriting, scenic
design, choreography , and rehearsals for the incoming class. These recent
grads are powerful role models. As Paul told me: “When they come into the
program, students believe they cannot make a dif ference; putting a program
like this together is a transforming experience for their future.”
In 2010 Paul started a new program specifically for foster -care youth.
This is a troubled population: Five years after maturing out of care, some 60
percent will have been convicted of a crime, 75 percent will be on public
assistance, and only 6 percent will have completed even a community
college degree.
The T rauma Center treats many foster care kids, but Grif fin gave me a
new way to see their lives: “Understanding foster care is like learning about
a foreign country . If you’re not from there, you don’ t speak the language.
Life is upside down for foster -care youth.” The security and love that other

children take for granted they have to create for themselves. When Grif fin
says, “Life is upside down,” he means that if you treat kids in foster care
with love or generosity , they often don’ t know what to make of it or how to
respond. Rudeness feels more familiar; cynicism they understand.
As Grif fin points out, “Abandonment makes it impossible to trust, and
kids who have gone through foster care understand abandonment. Y ou can
have no impact until they trust you.” Foster -care children often answer to
multiple people in char ge. If they want to switch schools, for example, they
have to deal with foster parents, school of ficials, the foster -care agency , and
sometimes a judge. This tends to make them politically savvy , and they
learn all too well how to play people.
In the foster -care world, “permanency” is a big buzzword. The motto is
“One caring adult—that’ s all you need.” However , it is natural for teenagers
to pull away from adults, and Grif fin remarks that the best form of
permanency for teens is a steady group of friends—which the program is
designed to provide. Another foster -care buzzword is “independence,”
which Paul counters with “ inter dependence.” “W e’re all interdependent,”
he points out. “The idea that we’re asking our young people to go out in the
world completely alone and call themselves independent is crazy . W e need
to teach them how to be interdependent, which means teaching them how to
have relationships.”
Paul found that foster -care youth are natural actors. Playing tragic
characters, you have to express emotions and create a reality that comes
from a place of depth and sorrow and hurt. Y oung people in foster care?
That’ s all they know . It’ s life and death every day for them. Over time,
collaboration helps the kids become important people in one another ’ s lives.
Phase one of the program is group building. The first rehearsal establishes
basic agreements: responsibility , accountability , respect; yes to expressions
of af fection, no to sexual contact in the group. They then begin singing and
moving together , which gets them in sync.
Now comes phase two: sharing life stories. They are now listening to
one another , discovering shared experiences, breaking through the
loneliness and isolation of trauma. Paul gave me a film that shows how this
happened in one group. When the kids are first asked to say or do
something to introduce themselves, they freeze, their faces expressionless,
their eyes cast down, doing anything they can to become invisible.

As they begin to talk, as they discover a voice in which they themselves
are central, they also begin to create their own show . Paul makes it clear the
production depends on their input: “If you could write a musical or play ,
what would you put in it? Punishment? Revenge? Betrayal? Loss? This is
your show to write.” Everything they say is written down, and some of
them start to put their own words on paper . As a script emer ges, the
production team incorporates the students’ precise words into the songs and
dialogue. The group will learn that if they can embody their experiences
well enough, other people will listen. They will learn to feel what they feel
and know what they know .
The focus changes naturally as rehearsals begin. The foster kids’
history of pain, alienation, and fear is no longer central, and the emphasis
shifts to “How can I become the best actor , singer , dancer , choreographer ,
or lighting and set designer I can possibly be?” Being able to perform
becomes the critical issue: Competence is the best defense against the
helplessness of trauma.
This is, of course, true for all of us. When the job goes bad, when a
cherished project fails, when someone you count on leaves you or dies,
there are few things as helpful as moving your muscles and doing
something that demands focused attention. Inner -city schools and
psychiatric programs often lose sight of this. They want the kids to behave
“normally”—without building the competencies that will make them feel
normal.
Theater programs also teach cause and ef fect. A foster kid’ s life is
completely unpredictable. Anything can happen without notice: being
triggered and having a meltdown; seeing a parent arrested or killed; being
moved from one home to another; getting yelled at for things that got you
approval in your last placement. In a theatrical production they see the
consequences of their decisions and actions laid out directly before their
eyes. “If you want to give them a sense of control, you have to give them
power over their destiny rather than intervene on their behalf,” Paul
explains. “Y ou cannot help, fix, or save the young people you are working
with. What you can do is work side by side with them, help them to
understand their vision, and realize it with them. By doing that you give
them back control. W e’re healing trauma without anyone ever mentioning
the word.”

SENTENCED T O SHAKESPEARE
For the teenagers attending sessions of Shakespeare in the Courts, there is
no improvisation, no building scripts around their own lives. They are all
“adjudicated of fenders” found guilty of fighting, drinking, stealing, and
property crimes, and a Berkshire County Juvenile Court judge has
sentenced them to six weeks, four afternoons a week, of intensive acting
study . Shakespeare is a foreign country for these actors. As Kevin Coleman
told me, when they first turn up—angry , suspicious, and in shock—they’re
convinced that they’d rather go to jail. Instead they’re going to learn the
lines of Hamlet, or Mark Antony , or Henry V and then go onstage in a
condensed performance of an entire Shakespeare play before an audience of
family , friends, and representatives of the juvenile justice system.
W ith no words to express the ef fects of their capricious upbringing,
these adolescents act out their emotions with violence. Shakespeare calls for
sword fighting, which, like other martial arts, gives them an opportunity to
practice contained aggression and expressions of physical power . The
emphasis is on keeping everyone safe. The kids love swordplay , but to keep
one another safe they have to negotiate and use language.
Shakespeare was writing at a time of transition, when the world was
moving from primarily oral to written communication—when most people
were still signing their name with an X . These kids are facing their own
period of transition; many are barely articulate, and some struggle to read at
all. If they rely on four -letter words, it’ s not only to show they’re tough but
because they have no other language to communicate who they are or what
they feel. When they discover the richness and the potential of language,
they often have a visceral experience of joy .
The actors first investigate what, exactly , Shakespeare is saying, line by
line. The director feeds the words one by one into the actors’ ears, and they
are instructed to say the line on the outgoing breath. At the beginning of the
process, many of these kids can barely get a line out. Progress is slow , as
each actor slowly internalizes the words. The words gain depth and
resonance as the voice changes in response to their associations. The idea is
to inspire the actors to sense their reactions to the words—and so to
discover the character . Rather than “I have to remember my lines,” the

emphasis is on “What do these words mean to me ? What ef fect do I  have on
my fellow actors? And what happens to me when I hear their lines?”13
This can be a life-changing process, as I witnessed in a workshop run
by actors trained by Shakespeare & Company at the V A Medical Center in
Bath, New Y ork. Larry , a fifty-nine-year -old V ietnam veteran with twenty-
seven detox hospitalizations during the previous year , had volunteered to
play the role of Brutus in a scene from Julius Caesar . As the rehearsal
began, he mumbled and hurried through his lines; he seemed to be terrified
of what people were thinking of him.
Remember Mar ch, the ides of Mar ch r emember:
Did not gr eat Julius bleed for justice’ sake?
What villain touch’d his body , that did stab,
And not for justice?
It seemed to take hours to rehearse the speech that begins with these
lines. At first he was just standing there, shoulders slumped, repeating the
words that the director whispered in his ear: “ Remember —what do you
remember? Do you remember too much? Or not enough? Remember . What
don’ t you want to remember? What is it like to remember?” Larry’ s voice
cracked, eyes to the floor , sweat beading on his forehead.
After a short break and a sip of water , back to work. “ Justice —did you
receive justice? Did you ever bleed for justice’ s sake? What does justice
mean to you? Struck . Have you ever struck someone? Have you ever been
struck? What was it like? What do you wish you had done? Stab . Have you
ever stabbed someone? Have you ever felt stabbed in the back? Have you
stabbed someone in the back?” At this point Larry bolted from the room.
The next day he returned and we began again—Larry standing there,
perspiring, heart racing, having a million associations going through his
mind, gradually allowing himself to feel every word and learning to own
the lines that he uttered.
At the end of the program Larry started his first job in seven years, and
he was still working the last I heard, six months later . Learning to
experience and tolerate deep emotions is essential for recovery from
trauma.

 • • • 
In Shakespeare in the Courts, the specificity of the language that is used in
rehearsal extends to the students’ of fstage speech. Kevin Coleman notes
that their talk is riddled with the expression “I feel like . . .” He goes on: “If
you are confusing your emotional experiences with your judgments, your
work becomes vague. If you ask them, ‘How did that feel?’ they’ll
immediately say: ‘It felt good’ or ‘That felt bad.’ Both of those are
judgments. So we never say , ‘How did that feel?’ at the end of a scene,
because it invites them to go to the judgment part of their brain.”
Instead Coleman asks, “Did you notice any specific feelings that came
up for you doing that scene?” That way they learn to name emotional
experiences: “I felt angry when he said that.” “I felt scared when he looked
at me.” Becoming embodied and, for lack of a better word, “en-languaged,”
helps the actors realize that they have many dif ferent emotions. The more
they notice, the more curious they get.
When rehearsals begin, the kids have to learn to stand up straight and
walk across a stage unselfconsciously . They have to learn to speak so that
they can be heard in all parts of the theater , which in itself presents a huge
challenge. The final performance means facing the community . The kids
step out onto the stage, experiencing another level of vulnerability , danger ,
or safety , and they find out how much they can trust themselves. Gradually
the eagerness to succeed, to show that they can do it, takes over . Kevin told
me the story of a girl who played Ophelia in Hamlet. On the day of the
performance he saw her waiting backstage, ready to go on, with a
wastebasket clutched to her belly . (She explained that she was so nervous
she was scared she’d throw up). She had been a chronic runaway from her
foster homes and also from Shakespeare in the Courts. Because the program
is committed to not throwing kids out if at all possible, the police and truant
of ficers had repeatedly brought her back. There must have come a point
when she began to realize that her role was essential to the group, or
perhaps she sensed the intrinsic value of the experience for herself. At least
for that day , she was choosing not to run.
THERAPY AND THEA TER

I once heard T ina Packer declare to a roomful of trauma specialists:
“Therapy and theater are intuition at work. They are the opposite of
research, where one strives to step outside of one’ s own personal
experience, even outside your patients’ experience, to test the objective
validity of assumptions. What makes therapy ef fective is deep, subjective
resonance and that deep sense of truth and veracity that lives in the body .” I
am still hoping that someday we will prove T ina wrong and combine the
rigor of scientific methods with the power of embodied intuition.
Edward, one of the Shakespeare & Company teachers, told me about an
experience he’d had as a young actor in Packer ’ s advanced training
workshop. The group had spent the morning doing exercises aimed at
getting the muscles of the torso to release, so that the breath could drop in
naturally and fully . Edward noticed that every time he rolled through one
section of his ribs, he’d feel a wave of sadness. The coach asked if he’d
ever been injured there, and he said no.
For Packer ’ s afternoon class he’d prepared a speech from Richar d II
where the king is summoned to give up his crown to the lord who has
usurped him. During the discussion afterward, he recalled that his mother
had broken her ribs when she was pregnant with him and that he’d always
associated this with his premature birth.
As he recalled:
When I told T ina this, she started asking me questions about
my first few months. I said I didn’ t remember being in an
incubator but that I remembered times later when I stopped
breathing, and being in the hospital in an oxygen tent. I
remembered being in my uncle’ s car and him driving through red
lights to get me to the emer gency room. It was like having sudden
infant death syndrome at the age of three.
T ina kept asking me questions, and I started to get really
frustrated and angry at her poking away at whatever shield I had
around that pain. Then she said, “W as it painful when the doctors
stuck all those needles in you?”
At that moment, I just started screaming. I tried to leave the
room, but two of the other actors—really big guys—held me

down. They finally got me to sit in a chair , and I was trembling
and shaking. Then T ina said, “Y ou’re your mother and you’re
going to do this speech. Y ou’re your mother and you’re giving
birth to yourself. And you’re telling yourself that you’re going to
make it. Y ou’re not going to die. Y ou must convince yourself. Y ou
must convince that little newborn that you’re not going to die.”
This became my intention with Richard’ s speech. When I first
brought the speech to class, I told myself that I wanted to get the
role right, not that something welling deep inside me needed to say
these words. When finally it did, it became so clear that my baby
was like Richard; I was not ready to give up my throne. It was like
megatons of ener gy and tension just left my body . Pathways
opened up for expression that had been blocked by this baby
holding his breath and being so afraid that it was going to die.
The genius of T ina was in having me become my mother
telling me I’d be okay . It was almost like going back and changing
the story . Being reassured that someday I would feel safe enough
to express my pain made it a precious part of my life.
That night I had the first or gasm I’d ever had in the presence of
another person. And I know it’ s because I released something—
some tension in my body—that allowed me to be more in the
world.

WE P I L O G U E
C H O I C E S  T O  B E  M A D E
e are on the ver ge of becoming a trauma-conscious society . Almost
every day one of my colleagues publishes another report on how
trauma disrupts the workings of mind, brain, and body . The ACE study
showed how early abuse devastates health and social functioning, while
James Heckman won a Nobel Prize for demonstrating the vast savings
produced by early intervention in the lives of children from poor and
troubled families: more high school graduations, less criminality , increased
employment, and decreased family and community violence. All over the
world I meet people who take these data seriously and who work tirelessly
to develop and apply more ef fective interventions, whether devoted
teachers, social workers, doctors, therapists, nurses, philanthropists, theater
directors, prison guards, police of ficers, or meditation coaches. If you have
come this far with me in The Body Ke e ps the Scor e , you have also become
part of this community .
Advances in neuroscience have given us a better understanding of how
trauma changes brain development, self-regulation, and the capacity to stay
focused and in tune with others. Sophisticated imaging techniques have
identified the origins of PTSD in the brain, so that we now understand why
traumatized people become disengaged, why they are bothered by sounds
and lights, and why they may blow up or withdraw in response to the
slightest provocation. W e have learned how , throughout life, experiences
change the structure and function of the brain—and even af fect the genes
we pass on to our children. Understanding many of the fundamental
processes that underlie traumatic stress opens the door to an array of

interventions that can bring the brain areas related to self-regulation, self-
perception, and attention back online. W e know not only how to treat
trauma but also, increasingly , how to prevent it.
And yet, after attending another wake for a teenager who was killed in
a drive-by shooting in the Blue Hill A venue section of Boston or after
reading about the latest school budget cuts in impoverished cities and
towns, I find myself close to despair . In many ways we seem to be
regressing, with measures like the callous congressional elimination of food
stamps for kids whose parents are unemployed or in jail; with the stubborn
opposition to universal health care in some quarters; with psychiatry’ s
obtuse refusal to make connection between psychic suf fering and social
conditions; with the refusal to prohibit the sale or possession of weapons
whose only purpose is to kill lar ge numbers of human beings; and with our
tolerance for incarcerating a huge segment of our population, wasting their
lives as well as our resources.
Discussions of PTSD still tend to focus on recently returned soldiers,
victims of terrorist bombings, or survivors of terrible accidents. But trauma
remains a much lar ger public health issue, ar guably the greatest threat to
our national well-being. Since 2001 far more Americans have died at the
hands of their partners or other family members than in the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. American women are twice as likely to suf fer domestic
violence as breast cancer . The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates
that firearms kill twice as many children as cancer does. All around Boston
I see signs advertising the Jimmy Fund, which fights children’ s cancer , and
for marches to fund research on breast cancer and leukemia, but we seem
too embarrassed or discouraged to mount a massive ef fort to help children
and adults learn to deal with the fear , rage, and collapse, the predictable
consequences of having been traumatized.
When I give presentations on trauma and trauma treatment, participants
sometimes ask me to leave out the politics and confine myself to talking
about neuroscience and therapy . I wish I could separate trauma from
politics, but as long as we continue to live in denial and treat only trauma
while ignoring its origins, we are bound to fail. In today’ s world your ZIP
code, even more than your genetic code, determines whether you will lead a
safe and healthy life. People’ s income, family structure, housing,
employment, and educational opportunities af fect not only their risk of

developing traumatic stress but also their access to ef fective help to address
it. Poverty , unemployment, inferior schools, social isolation, widespread
availability of guns, and substandard housing all are breeding grounds for
trauma. T rauma breeds further trauma; hurt people hurt other people.
My most profound experience with healing from collective trauma was
witnessing the work of the South African T ruth and Reconciliation
Commission, which was based on the central guiding principle of Ubuntu , a
Xhosa word that denotes sharing what you have, as in “My humanity is
inextricably bound up in yours.” Ubuntu recognizes that true healing is
impossible without recognition of our common humanity and our common
destiny .
W e are fundamentally social creatures—our brains are wired to foster
working and playing together . T rauma devastates the social-engagement
system and interferes with cooperation, nurturing, and the ability to
function as a productive member of the clan. In this book we have seen how
many mental health problems, from drug addiction to self-injurious
behavior , start of f as attempts to cope with emotions that became
unbearable because of a lack of adequate human contact and support. Y et
institutions that deal with traumatized children and adults all too often
bypass the emotional-engagement system that is the foundation of who we
are and instead focus narrowly on correcting “faulty thinking” and on
suppressing unpleasant emotions and troublesome behaviors.
People can learn to control and change their behavior , but only if they
feel safe enough to experiment with new solutions. The body keeps the
score: If trauma is encoded in heartbreaking and gut-wrenching sensations,
then our first priority is to help people move out of fight-or -flight states,
reor ganize their perception of danger , and manage relationships. Where
traumatized children are concerned, the last things we should be cutting
from school schedules are the activities that can do precisely that: chorus,
physical education, recess, and anything else that involves movement, play ,
and other forms of joyful engagement.
As we’ve seen, my own profession often compounds, rather than
alleviates, the problem. Many psychiatrists today work in assembly-line
of fices where they see patients they hardly know for fifteen minutes and
then dole out pills to relieve pain, anxiety , or depression. Their message
seems to be “Leave it to us to fix you; just be compliant and take these

drugs and come back in three months—but be sure not to use alcohol or
(illegal) drugs to relieve your problems.” Such shortcuts in treatment make
it impossible to develop  self-care and self-leadership. One tragic example of
this orientation is the rampant prescription of painkillers, which now kill
more people each year in the United States than guns or car accidents.
Our increasing use of drugs to treat these conditions doesn’ t address the
real issues: What are these patients trying to cope with? What are their
internal or external resources? How do they calm themselves down? Do
they have caring relationships with their bodies, and what do they do to
cultivate a physical sense of power , vitality , and relaxation? Do they have
dynamic interactions with other people? Who really knows them, loves
them, and cares about them? Whom can they count on when they’re scared,
when their babies are ill, or when they are sick themselves? Are they
members of a community , and do they play vital roles in the lives of the
people around them? What specific skills do they need to focus, pay
attention, and make choices? Do they have a sense of purpose? What are
they good at? How can we help them feel in char ge of their lives?
I like to believe that once our society truly focuses on the needs of
children, all forms of social support for families—a policy that remains so
controversial in this country—will gradually come to seem not only
desirable but also doable. What dif ference would it make if all American
children had access to high-quality day care where parents could safely
leave their children as they went of f to work or school? What would our
school systems look like if all children could attend well-staf fed preschools
that cultivated cooperation, self-regulation, perseverance, and concentration
(as opposed to focusing on passing tests, which will likely happen once
children are allowed to follow their natural curiosity and desire to excel,
and are not shut down by hopelessness, fear , and hyperarousal)?
I have a family photograph of myself as a five-year -old, perched
between my older (obviously wiser) and younger (obviously more
dependent) siblings. In the picture I proudly hold up a wooden toy boat,
grinning from ear to ear: “See what a wonderful kid I am and see what an
incredible boat I have! W ouldn’ t you love to come and play with me?” All
of us, but especially children, need such confidence—confidence that others
will know , af firm, and cherish us. W ithout that we can’ t develop a sense of
agency that will enable us to assert: “This is what I believe in; this is what I

stand for; this is what I will devote myself to.” As long as we feel safely
held in the hearts and minds of the people who love us, we will climb
mountains and cross deserts and stay up all night to finish projects. Children
and adults will do anything for people they trust and whose opinion they
value.
But if we feel abandoned, worthless, or invisible, nothing seems to
matter . Fear destroys curiosity and playfulness. In order to have a healthy
society we must raise children who can safely play and learn. There can be
no growth without curiosity and no adaptability without being able to
explore, through trial and error , who you are and what matters to you.
Currently more than 50 percent of the children served by Head Start have
had three or more adverse childhood experiences like those included in the
ACE study: incarcerated family members, depression, violence, abuse, or
drug use in the home, or periods of homelessness.
People who feel safe and meaningfully connected with others have
little reason to squander their lives doing drugs or staring numbly at
television; they don’ t feel compelled to stuf f themselves with carbohydrates
or assault their fellow human beings. However , if nothing they do seems to
make a dif ference, they feel trapped and become susceptible to the lure of
pills, gang leaders, extremist religions, or violent political movements—
anybody and anything that promises relief. As the ACE study has shown,
child abuse and neglect is the single most preventable cause of mental
illness, the single most common cause of drug and alcohol abuse,  and a
significant contributor to leading causes of death such as diabetes, heart
disease, cancer , stroke, and suicide.
My colleagues and I focus much of our work where trauma has its
greatest impact: on children and adolescents. Since we came together to
establish the National Child T raumatic Stress Network in 2001, it has
grown into a collaborative network of more than 150 centers nationwide,
each of which has created programs in schools, juvenile justice systems,
child welfare agencies , homeless shelters, military facilities, and residential
group homes.
The T rauma Center is one of NCTSN’ s T reatment Development and
Evaluation sites. My colleagues Joe Spinazzola, Mar garet Blaustein, and I
have developed comprehensive programs for children and adolescents that
we, with the help of trauma-savvy colleagues in Hartford, Chicago,

Houston, San Francisco, Anchorage, Los Angeles, and New Y ork, are now
implementing. Our team selects a particular area of the country to work in
every two years, relying on local contacts to identify or ganizations that are
ener getic, open, and well respected; these will eventually serve as new
nodes for treatment dissemination. For example, I collaborated for one two-
year period with colleagues in Missoula, Montana, to help develop a
culturally sensitive trauma program on Blackfoot Indian reservations.
The greatest hope for traumatized, abused, and neglected children is to
receive a good education in schools where they are seen and known, where
they learn to regulate themselves, and where they can develop a sense of
agency . At their best, schools can function as islands of safety in a chaotic
world. They can teach children how their bodies and brains work and how
they can understand and deal with their emotions. Schools can play a
significant role in instilling the resilience necessary to deal with the traumas
of neighborhoods or families. If parents are forced to work two jobs to eke
out a living, or if they are too impaired, overwhelmed, or depressed to be
attuned to the needs of their kids, schools by default have to be the places
where children are taught self-leadership and an internal locus of control.
When our team arrives at a school, the teachers’ initial response is
often some version of “If I’d wanted to be a social worker , I would have
gone to social work school. But I came here to be a teacher .” Many of them
have already learned the hard way , however , that they cannot teach if they
have a classroom filled with students whose alarm bells are constantly
going of f. Even the most committed teachers and school systems often
come to feel frustrated and inef fective because so many of their kids are too
traumatized to learn. Focusing only on improving test scores won’ t make
any dif ference if teachers can’ t ef fectively address the behavior problems of
these students. The good news is that the basic principles of trauma-focused
interventions can be translated into practical day-to-day routines and
approaches that can transform the entire culture of a school.
Most teachers we work with are intrigued to learn that abused and
neglected students are likely to interpret any deviation from routine as
danger and that their extreme reactions usually are expressions of traumatic
stress. Children who defy the rules are unlikely to be brought to reason by
verbal reprimands or even suspension—a practice that has become
epidemic in American schools. T eachers’ perspectives begin to change

when they realize that these kids’ disturbing behaviors started out as
frustrated attempts to communicate distress and as misguided attempts to
survive.
More than anything else, being able to feel safe with other people
defines mental health; safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and
satisfying lives. The critical challenge in a classroom setting is to foster
reciprocity: truly hearing and being heard; really seeing and being seen by
other people. W e try to teach everyone in a school community—of fice staf f,
principals, bus drivers, teachers, and cafeteria workers—to recognize and
understand the ef fects of trauma on children and to focus on the importance
of fostering safety , predictability , and being known and seen. W e make
certain that the children are greeted by name every morning and that
teachers make face-to-face contact with each and every one of them. Just as
in our workshops, group work, and theater programs, we always start the
day with check-ins: taking the time to share what’ s on everybody’ s mind.
Many of the children we work with have never been able to
communicate successfully with language, as they are accustomed to adults
who yell, command, sulk, or put earbuds in their ears. One of our first steps
is to help their teachers model new ways of talking about feelings, stating
expectations, and asking for help. Instead of yelling, “Stop!” when a child is
throwing a tantrum or making her sit alone in the corner , teachers are
encouraged to notice and name the child’ s experience, as in “I can see how
upset you are”; to give her choices, as in “W ould you like to go to the safe
spot or sit on my lap?”; and to help her find words to describe her feelings
and begin to find her voice, as in: “What will happen when you get home
after class?” It may take many months for a child to know when it is safe to
speak the truth (because it will never be universally safe), but for children,
as for adults, identifying the truth of an experience is essential to healing
from trauma.
It is standard practice in many schools to punish children for tantrums,
spacing out, or aggressive outbursts—all of which are often symptoms of
traumatic stress. When that happens, the school, instead of of fering a safe
haven, becomes yet another traumatic trigger . Angry confrontations and
punishment can at best temporarily halt unacceptable behaviors, but since
the underlying alarm system and stress hormones are not laid to rest, they
are certain to erupt again at the next provocation.

In such situations the first step is acknowledging that a child is upset;
then the teacher should calm him, then explore the cause and discuss
possible solutions. For example, when a first-grader melts down, hitting his
teacher and throwing objects around, we encourage his teacher to set clear
limits while gently talking to him: “ W ould you like to wrap that blanket
around you to help you calm down?” (The kid is likely to scream, “No!” but
then curl up under the blanket and settle down.) Predictability and clarity of
expectations are critical; consistency is essential. Children from chaotic
backgrounds often have no idea how people can ef fectively work together ,
and inconsistency only promotes further confusion. T rauma-sensitive
teachers soon realize that calling a parent about an obstreperous kid is likely
to result in a beating and further traumatization.
Our goal in all these ef forts is to translate brain science into everyday
practice. For example, calming down enough to take char ge of ourselves
requires activating the brain areas that notice our inner sensations, the self-
observing watchtower discussed in chapter 4. So a teacher might say: “Shall
we take some deep breaths or use the breathing star?” (This is a colorful
breathing aid made out of file folders.) Another option might be having the
child sit in a corner wrapped in a heavy blanket while listening to some
soothing music through headphones. Safe areas can help kids calm down by
providing stimulating sensory awareness: the texture of burlap or velvet;
shoe boxes filled with soft brushes and flexible toys. When the child is
ready to talk again, he is encouraged to tell someone what is going on
before he rejoins the group.
Kids as young as three can blow soap bubbles and learn that when they
slow down their breathing to six breaths per minute and focus on the out
breath as it flows over their upper lip, they will feel more calm and focused.
Our team of yoga teachers works with children nearing adolescence
specifically to help them “befriend” their bodies and deal with disruptive
physical sensations. W e know that one of the prime reasons for habitual
drug use in teens is that they cannot stand the physical sensations that signal
fear , rage, and helplessness.
Self-regulation can be taught to many kids who cycle between frantic
activity and immobility . In addition to reading, writing, and arithmetic, all
kids need to learn self-awareness, self-regulation, and communication as
part of their core curriculum. Just as we teach history  and geography , we

need to teach children how their brains and bodies work. For adults and
children alike, being in control of ourselves requires becoming familiar with
our inner world and accurately identifying what scares, upsets, or delights
us.
Emotional intelligence starts with labeling your own feelings and
attuning to the emotions of the people around you.  W e begin very simply:
with mirrors. Looking into a mirror helps kids to be aware of what they
look like when they are sad, angry , bored, or disappointed. Then we ask
them, “How do you feel when you see a face like that?” W e teach them how
their brains are built, what emotions are for , and where they are registered
in their bodies, and how they can communicate their feelings to the people
around them.  They learn that their facial muscles give clues about what they
are feeling and then  experiment  with how their facial expressions af fect
other people.
W e also strengthen the brain’ s watchtower by teaching them to
recognize and name their physical sensations. For example, when their
chest tightens, that probably means that they are nervous; their breathing
becomes shallow and they feel uptight. What does anger feel like, and what
can they do to change that sensation in their body? What happens if they
take a deep breath or take time out to jump rope or hit a punching bag?
Does tapping acupressure points help? W e try to provide children, teachers,
and other care providers with a toolbox of ways to take char ge of their
emotional reactions.
T o promote reciprocity , we use other mirroring exercises, which are the
foundation of safe interpersonal communication. Kids practice imitating
one another ’ s facial expressions. They proceed to imitating gestures and
sounds and then get up and move in sync. T o play well, they have to pay
attention to really seeing and hearing one another . Games like Simon Says
lead to  lots of sniggering and giggling—signs of safety and relaxation.
When teenagers balk at these “stupid games,” we nod understandingly and
enlist their cooperation by asking them to demonstrate games to the little
kids, who “need their help.”
T eachers and leaders learn that an activity as simple as trying to keep a
beach ball in the air as long as possible helps groups become more focused,
cohesive, and fun. These are inexpensive interventions. For older children
some schools have installed workstations costing less than two hundred

dollars where students can play computer games to help them focus and to
improve their heart rate variability (HR V) (discussed in chapter 16), just as
we do in our own clinic.
Children and adults alike need to experience how rewarding it is to
work at the edge of their abilities. Resilience is the product of agency:
knowing that what you do can make a dif ference .  Many of us remember
what playing team sports, singing in the school choir , or playing in the
marching band meant to us, especially if we had coaches or directors who
believed in us, pushed us to excel, and taught us we could be better than we
thought was possible. The children we reach need this experience.
Athletics, playing music, dancing, and theatrical performances all
promote agency and community . They also engage kids in novel challenges
and unaccustomed roles. In a devastated postindustrial New England town,
my friends Carolyn and Eli Newber ger are teaching El Sistema, an
orchestral music program that originated in V enezuela. Several of my
students run an after -school program in Brazilian capoeira  in a high-crime
area of Boston, and my colleagues at the T rauma Center continue the
T rauma Drama program.  Last year I spent three weeks helping two boys
prepare a scene from Julius Caesar . An ef feminate, shy boy was playing
Brutus and had to summon up his full force to put down Cassius, played by
the class bully , who had to be coached to play a corrupt general begging for
mercy .  The scene came to life only after the bully talked about his father ’ s
violence and his own vow never to show weakness to anyone. (Most bullies
have themselves been bullied, and they despise kids who remind them of
their own vulnerability .) Brutus’ s powerful voice, on the other hand,
emer ged after he realized that he’d made himself invisible to deal with his
own family violence.
These intense communal ef forts force kids to collaborate, compromise,
and stay focused on the task at hand. T ensions often run high, but the kids
stick with it because they want to earn the respect of their coaches or
directors and don’ t want to let down the team—all feelings that are opposite
to the vulnerability of being subjected to arbitrary abuse, the invisibility of
neglect, and the godforsaken isolation of trauma.
Our NCTSN programs are working: Kids become less anxious and
emotionally reactive and are less aggressive or withdrawn; they get along
better and their school performance improves; their attention deficit,

hyperactivity , and “oppositional defiant” problems decrease; and parents
report that their children are sleeping better . T errible things still happen to
them and around them, but they are now able to talk about these events;
they have built up the trust and resources to seek the help they need.
Interventions are successful if they draw on our natural wellsprings of
cooperation and on our inborn responses to safety , reciprocity , and
imagination.
T rauma constantly confronts us with our fragility and with man’ s
inhumanity to man but also with our extraordinary resilience. I have been
able to do this work for so long because it drew me to explore our sources
of joy , creativity , meaning, and connection—all the things that make life
worth living. I can’ t begin to imagine how I would have coped with what
many of my patients have endured, and I see their symptoms as part of their
strength—the ways they learned to survive. And despite all their suf fering
many have gone on to become loving partners and parents, exemplary
teachers, nurses, scientists, and artists.
Most great instigators of social change have intimate personal
knowledge of trauma.  Oprah W infrey comes to mind, as do Maya Angelou,
Nelson Mandela, and Elie W iesel. Read the life history of any visionary ,
and you will find insights and passions that came from having dealt with
devastation.
The same is true of societies. Many of our most profound advances
grew out of experiencing trauma: the abolition of slavery from the Civil
W ar , Social Security in response to the Great Depression, and the GI Bill,
which produced our once vast and prosperous middle class, from W orld
W ar II. T rauma is now our most ur gent public health issue, and we have the
knowledge necessary to respond ef fectively . The choice is ours to act on
what we know .

A C K N O W L E D G M E N T S
This book is the fruit of thirty years of trying to understand how people deal
with, survive, and heal from traumatic experiences. Thirty years of clinical
work with traumatized men, women and children; innumerable discussions
with colleagues and students, and participation in the evolving science
about how mind, brain, and body deal with, and recover from,
overwhelming experiences.
Let me start with the people who helped me or ganize, and eventually
publish, this book. T oni Burbank, my editor , with whom I communicated
many times each week over a two-year period about the scope,
or ganization, and specific contents of the book. T oni truly understood what
this book is about, and that understanding has been critical in defining its
form and substance. My agent, Brettne Bloom, understood the importance
of this work, found a home for it with V iking, and provided critical support
at critical moments. Rick Kot, my editor at V iking, supplied invaluable
feedback and editorial guidance.
My colleagues and students at the T rauma Center have provided the
feeding ground, laboratory , and support system for this work. They also
have been constant reminders of the sober reality of our work for these
three decades. I cannot name them all, but Joseph Spinazzola, Mar garet
Blaustein, Roslin Moore, Richard Jacobs, Liz W arner , W endy D’Andrea,
Jim Hopper , Fran Grossman, Alex Cook, Marla Zucker , Kevin Becker ,
David Emerson, Steve Gross, Dana Moore, Robert Macy , Liz Rice-Smith,
Patty Levin, Nina Murray , Mark Gapen, Carrie Pekor , Debbie Korn, and
Betta de Boer van der Kolk all have been critical collaborators. And of
course Andy Pond and Susan W ayne of the Justice Resource Institute.

My most important companions and guides in understanding and
researching traumatic stress have been Alexander McFarlane, Onno van der
Hart, Ruth Lanius and Paul Frewen, Rachel Y ehuda, Stephen Por ges, Glenn
Saxe, Jaak Panksepp, Janet Osterman, Julian Ford, Brad Stolback, Frank
Putnam, Bruce Perry , Judith Herman, Robert Pynoos, Berthold Gersons,
Ellert Nijenhuis, Annette Streeck-Fisher , Marylene Cloitre, Dan Siegel, Eli
Newber ger , V incent Felitti, Robert Anda, and Martin T eicher; as well as my
colleagues who taught me about attachment: Edward T ronick, Karlen
L yons-Ruth, and Beatrice Beebe.
Peter Levine, Pat Ogden, and Al Pesso read my paper on the
importance of the body in traumatic stress back in 1994 and then of fered to
teach me about the body . I am still learning from them, and that learning
has since then been expanded by yoga and meditation teachers Stephen
Cope, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and Jack Kornfield.
Sebern Fisher first taught me about neurofeedback. Ed Hamlin and
Larry Hirshber g later expanded that understanding. Richard Schwartz
taught me internal family systems (IFS) therapy and assisted in helping to
write the chapter on IFS. Kippy Dewey and Cissa Campion introduced me
to theater , T ina Packer tried to teach me how to do it, and Andrew
Borthwick- Leslie provided critical details.
Adam Cummings, Amy Sullivan, and Susan Miller provided
indispensible support, without which many projects in this book could
never have been accomplished.
Licia Sky created the environment that allowed me to concentrate on
writing this book; she provided invaluable feedback on each one of the
chapters; she donated her artistic gifts to many illustrations; and she
contributed to sections on body awareness and clinical case material. My
trusty secretary , Angela Lin, took care of multiple crises and kept the ship
running at full speed. Ed and Edith Schonber g often provided a shelter from
the storm; Barry and Lorrie Goldensohn served as literary critics and
inspiration; and my children, Hana and Nicholas, showed me that every
new generation lives in a world that is radically dif ferent from the previous
one, and that each life is unique—a creative act by its owner that defies
explanation by genetics, environment, or culture alone.
Finally , my patients, to whom I dedicate this book—I wish I could
mention you all by name—who taught me almost everything I know—

because you were my true textbook—and the af firmation of the life force,
which drives us human beings to create a meaningful life, regardless of the
obstacles we encounter .

The goal of introducing the diagnosis of Developmental T rauma Disorder is
to capture the reality of the clinical presentations of children and
adolescents exposed to chronic interpersonal trauma and thereby guide
clinicians to develop and utilize ef fective interventions and for researchers
to study the neurobiology and transmission of chronic interpersonal
violence. Whether or not they exhibit symptoms of PTSD, children who
have developed in the context of ongoing danger , maltreatment, and
inadequate caregiving systems are ill-served by the current diagnostic
system, as it frequently leads to no diagnosis, multiple unrelated diagnoses,
an emphasis on behavioral control without recognition of interpersonal
trauma and lack of safety in the etiology of symptoms, and a lack of
attention to ameliorating the developmental disruptions that underlie the
symptoms.
The Consensus Proposed Criteria for Developmental T rauma Disorder
were devised and put forward in February 2009 by a National Child
T raumatic Stress Network (NCTSN)-af filiated T ask Force led by Bessel A.
van der Kolk, MD and Robert S. Pynoos, MD, with the participation of
Dante Cicchetti, PhD, Marylene Cloitre, PhD, W endy D’Andrea, PhD,
Julian D. Ford, PhD, Alicia F . Lieberman, PhD, Frank W . Putnam, MD,
Glenn Saxe, MD, Joseph Spinazzola, PhD, Bradley C. Stolbach, PhD, and
Martin T eicher , MD, PhD. The consensus proposed criteria are based on

extensive review of empirical literature, expert clinical wisdom, surveys of
NCTSN clinicians, and preliminary analysis of data from thousands of
children in numerous clinical and child service system settings, including
NCTSN treatment centers, state child welfare systems, inpatient psychiatric
settings, and juvenile detention centers. Because their validity , prevalence,
symptom thresholds, or clinical utility have yet to be examined through
prospective data collection or analysis, these proposed criteria should not be
viewed as a formal diagnostic category to be incorporated into the DSM as
written here. Rather , they are intended to describe the most clinically
significant symptoms exhibited by many children and adolescents following
complex trauma. These proposed criteria have guided the Developmental
T rauma Disorder field trials that began in 2009 and continue to this day .

that numerous textbooks on war trauma were published around both the First and Second W orld
W ars, but as Abram Kardiner wrote in 1947: “The subject of neurotic disturbances consequent
upon war has, in the past 25 years, been submitted to a good deal of capriciousness in public
interest and psychiatric whims. The public does not sustain its interest, which was very great
after W orld W ar I, and neither does psychiatry . Hence these conditions are not subject to
continuous study .”

31 . During the past decade two editors in chief of the most prestigious professional medical journal
in the United States, the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr . Marcia Angell and Dr . Arnold
Relman, have resigned from their positions because of the excessive power of the
pharmaceutical industry over medical research, hospitals, and doctors. In a letter to the New
Y ork T imes  on December 28, 2004, Angell and Relman pointed out that the previous year one
drug company had spent 28 percent of its revenues (more than $6 billion) on marketing and
administrative expenses, while spending only half that on research and development; keeping 30
percent in net income was typical for the pharmaceutical industry . They concluded: “The
medical profession should break its dependence on the pharmaceutical industry and educate its
own.” Unfortunately , this is about as likely as politicians breaking free from the donors that
finance their election campaigns.

gone away and asked them to make up a story of what happened next. Most six-year -olds who,
as infants, had been found to have secure relationships with their mothers made up some
imaginative tale with a good ending, while the kids who five years earlier had been classified as
having a disor ganized attachment relationship had a tendency toward catastrophic fantasies and
often gave frightened responses like “The parents will die” or “The child will kill herself.” In

regulatory abnormalities, but intervening life events, the quality of other relationships, and
perhaps even genetic factors are likely to modify them over time. It is obviously critical to study
to what degree consistent and concentrated parenting of children with early histories of abuse
and neglect can rearrange biological systems.

these out-of-body experiences, staring at themselves as if looking down from the ceiling, they
are activating the superior temporal cortex in the brain. O. Blanke, et al., “Linking Out-of-Body

5 . When an adult uses a child for sexual gratification, the child invariably is caught in a confusing
situation and a conflict of loyalties: By disclosing the abuse, she betrays and hurts the
perpetrator (who may be an adult on whom the child depends for safety and protection), but by
hiding the abuse, she compounds her shame and vulnerability . This dilemma was first
articulated by Sándor Ferenczi in 1933 in “The Confusion of T ongues Between the Adult and
the Child: The Language of T enderness and the Language of Passion,” International Journal of
Psychoanalysis , 30 no. 4 (1949): 225–30, and has been explored by numerous subsequent
authors.

23 . For children who were physically abused, the chance of being diagnosed with conduct disorder
or oppositional defiant disorder went up by a factor of three. Neglect or sexual abuse doubled
the chance of developing an anxiety disorder . Parental psychological unavailability or sexual
abuse doubled the chance of later developing PTSD. The chance of receiving multiple diagnoses
was 54 percent for children who suf fered neglect, 60 percent for physical abuse, and 73 percent
for both sexual abuse.
24 . This was a quote based on the work of Emmy W erner , who has studied 698 children born on
the island of Kauai for forty years, starting in 1955. The study showed that most children who
grew up in unstable households grew up to experience problems with delinquency , mental and
physical health, and family stability . One-third of all high-risk children displayed resilience and
developed into caring, competent, and confident adults. Pr otective factors  were 1. being an
appealing child, 2. a strong bond with a nonparent caretaker (such as an aunt, a babysitter , or a
teacher) and strong involvement in church or community groups. E. E. W erner and R. S. Smith,

26 . In the sixty-three studies on disruptive mood regulation disorder , nobody asked anything about
attachment, PTSD, trauma, child abuse, or neglect. The word “maltreatment” is used in passing
in just one of the sixty-three articles. There is nothing about parenting, family dynamics, or
about family therapy .

American Counseling Association sent a letter on behalf of its 1 15,000 DSM-buying members
to the president of the AP A, also objecting to the quality of the science behind DSM-5—and
“ur ge(d) the AP A to make public the work of the scientific review committee it had appointed to

reappearance of sexual activity is determined by internal causes and external contingencies . . . I
shall have to speak presently of the internal causes; gr eat and lasting importance attaches at this
period to the accidental external [Freud’ s emphasis]  contingencies. In the for egr ound we find
the effects of seduction, which tr eats a child as a sexual object pr ematur ely  and teaches him, in
highly emotional circumstances, how to obtain satisfaction from his genital zones, a satisfaction
which he is then usually obliged to repeat again and again by masturbation. An influence of this
kind may originate either from adults or from other children. I cannot admit that in my paper on
‘The Aetiology of Hysteria’ (1896c) I exaggerated the fr equency or importance of that influence,

though I did not then know that persons who remain normal may have had the same experiences
in their childhood, and though I consequently overrated the importance of seduction in
comparison with the factors of sexual constitution and development. Obviously seduction is not
required in order to arouse a child’ s sexual life; that can also come about spontaneously from
internal causes. S. Freud “Introductory Lectures in Psycho-analysis in Stand ar d Edition (1916),

25 . In a neuroimaging study the PTSD subjects deactivated the speech area of their brain, Broca’ s
area, in response to neutral words. In other words: the decreased Broca’ s area functioning that
we had found in PTSD patients (see chapter 3) did not only occur in response to traumatic
memories; it also happened when they were asked to pay attention to neutral words. This means
that, as a group, traumatized patients have a harder time to articulate what they feel and think
about ordinary events. The PTSD group also had decreased activation of the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC), the frontal lobe area that, as we have seen, conveys awareness of one’ s self, and
dampens activation of the amygdala, the smoke detector . This made it harder for them to
suppress the brain’ s fear response in response to a simple language task and again, made it
harder to pay attention and go on with their lives. See: Moores, K. A., Clark, C. R., McFarlane,

and Chester Pearlman, as well as our lab, found that traumatized veterans wake themselves up
as soon as they enter a REM period. While many traumatized individuals use alcohol to help
them sleep, they thereby keep themselves from the full benefits of dreaming (the integration and
transformation of memory) and thereby may contribute to preventing the resolution of their
PTSD.

both fun and ef fective in helping people to achieve better HR V . T o date nobody has studied
whether simple devices such as those developed by HeartMath can reduce PTSD symptoms, but
this very likely the case. (see in www .heartmath.or g.)

21 . In chapter 17, we saw how essential it is to cultivate a state of steady , calm self-observation,
which IFS calls a state of “being in self.” Dick Schwartz claims that with persistence anybody
can achieve such a state, and indeed, I have seen him help very traumatized people do precisely
that. I am not that skilled, and many of my most severely traumatized patients become frantic or
spaced out when we approach upsetting subjects. Others feel so chronically out of control that it
is dif ficult to find any abiding sense of “self.” In most psychiatric settings people with these
problems are given medications to stabilize them. Sometimes that works, but many patients lose
their motivation and drive. In our randomized controlled study of neurofeedback, chronically
traumatized patients had an approximately 30 percent reduction in PTSD symptoms and a
significant improvement in measures of executive function and emotional control (van der Kolk
et al., submitted 2014).
