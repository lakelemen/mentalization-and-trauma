                                    Children and adults exposed to chronic interpersonal trauma consistently demonstrate psychological
                                    disturbances that are not captured in the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. The DSM-
                                    IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) Field Trial studied 400 treatment-seeking traumatized
                                    individuals and 128 community residents and found that victims of prolonged interpersonal trauma,
                                    particularly trauma early in the life cycle, had a high incidence of problems with (a) regulation
                                    of affect and impulses, (b) memory and attention, (c) self-perception, (d) interpersonal relations,
                                    (e) somatization, and (f) systems of meaning. This raises important issues about the categorical
                                    versus the dimensional nature of posttraumatic stress, as well as the issue of comorbidity in PTSD.
                                    These data invite further exploration of what constitutes effective treatment of the full spectrum of
                                    posttraumatic psychopathology.




     In the late 1970s, when hundreds of thousands                                         veterans (Shatan, Smith, & Haley, 1977) to arrive at
